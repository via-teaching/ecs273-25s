NKE has been making efforts to offer a seamless experience. The company is intensifying its focus on sports and speeding up the introduction and expansion of new products and innovations.We note that NIKE’s Jordan Brand Air Rev has come up with Flight Lock technology to bring a customizable system of containment to aid golfers. This will be initially available on May 14 at jordan.com and select retail partners in North America, which will then be launched globally in the future months. Golfers can avail new Jordan Brand Golf apparel this summer.The Flight Lock technology debuts a movable Air Zoom unit keeping the trailing foot locked in place, with effective pressure on every swing. The Air Zoom unit pairs with an interchangeable Formula23 foam, which is to be used on the lead foot, while providing cushioned stability. Hence, the latest customizable system ensures both left and right-handed golfers have the same model of shoe with the swapping of the Air Zoom unit and Formula23 foam according to their requirements. In addition, the dial lacing system permits golfers to customize their fit further, while the leno weave strap aids them in locking in for throughout the day performance.The silhouette pairs with Jordan Brand Golf apparel that blends Michael Jordan golf silhouettes with contemporary styles, offering an edge to the game. This looks forward to offering efficiency and consistency alongside staying grounded in fit, form and functionality.NIKE is also enhancing its storytelling efforts with greater impact and boldness while elevating the overall marketplace to strengthen brand distinction and align with consumer preferences.
