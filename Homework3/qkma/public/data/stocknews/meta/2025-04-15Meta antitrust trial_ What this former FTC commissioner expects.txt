Instagram was 20 people and they paid a billion dollars for it and everybody thought they were crazy. So, um, that was a very interesting time. You know, it's interesting, the government has framed this as the, um, that Meta bought Instagram and WhatsApp in order to eliminate competition and because of that, that those products have become worse for consumers than they could have been and that the actual market is actually uh the personal social networking, which is among friends. Meta, on the other hand has a different version or a different view of what the market is and what they were doing. They said it was strategic, those products have become better, they still remain free and that the market is actually much bigger. Friends actually are a very small part of what these apps do and what the market is and the market is actually much broader in terms of competition with companies like TikTok and, uh, and X, and YouTube and those provide the real competitive marketplace. So it's interesting that we're also looking at these transactions not only what what they were thinking then, that's not only Meta, but also what the US government was thinking then, but what they what has actually happened since then, 10 years, over 10 years is a very long time.Mhm. Well, it's interesting Moselle because you mentioned TikTok, X, YouTube, all competition, but given how similar to the end consumer that those platforms look to some of the meta platforms, is that argument going to be enough that that competition still exists outside of meta?Well, I think that it it it is pretty real, you know, one of the things that that I I have found interesting in the framing yesterday is that, um, the FTC says that the market uh, uh is actually smaller uh than it really is, that if you look at the broader market, Meta only controls sev 30% of that market. You have all these other companies out there and I think if you look at it from an advertising space, most advertisers view that market is the larger market. They want to figure out how to get to all of those different segments within the marketplace.J.B. Hunt Transport Services’ first-quarter earnings result came in ahead of recently lowered forecasts.
