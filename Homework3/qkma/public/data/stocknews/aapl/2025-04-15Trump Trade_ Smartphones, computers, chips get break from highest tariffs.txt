White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said in a statement that Trump “has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops.” Desai added, “At the direction of the President, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.” Dan Ives, head of technology research at Wedbush, told CNBC, “This is the dream scenario for tech investors. Smartphones, chips being excluded is a game changer scenario when it comes to China tariffs.”President Donald Trump stated in a Truth Social post, “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst! There was no Tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’ The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America, which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate, will mean more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us.”BIG RELIEF: JPMorgan lowered the firm’s price target on Apple (AAPL) to $245 from $270 but kept an Overweight rating on the shares, saying the latest updates from the Trump administration late on Friday, exempting smartphones and PCs from reciprocal tariffs, is a “big relief” for Apple. While the exemption will help return investor focus back to some of the company’s medium-term drivers, “several concerns” remain from the developments over the last two weeks, the firm tells investors in a research note. JPMorgan thinks these will “limit investors from immediately turning to any bull case” for Apple. Semiconductor tariffs are still to be announced and could impact Apple, adds the firm. JPMorgan updated its estimates for lower demand from the macro slowdown and potential further downside risk on the resumption of tariffs. It forecasts slowing demand from fiscal Q4 into fiscal 2026 and revised its fiscal 2026 and 2027 iPhone volume expectations to 232M and 242M, respectively, from 249M and 255M units prior.DEPORTATION EFFORTS: Prison operator Geo Group (GEO) has built a lucrative side business of digital tools to surveil immigrants on behalf of the federal government over the last decade, making it one of the Trump administration’s big business winners amid deportations, the New York Times’ Paul Mozur, Adam Satariano and Aaron Krolik report, citing legal aid groups and immigration organizations. The company’s ankle monitors, smart watches and tracking apps are aiding the government by providing the locations of unauthorized immigrants to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and legal groups estimate the number of arrests made from the digital monitoring programs is at least in the hundreds.U.S. STEEL: U.S President Donald Trump reaffirmed that he does not believe a foreign company should control U.S. Steel (X), following similar comments he made regarding the $15B takeover bid by Japan’s Nippon Steel (NPSCY), Reuters’ Jeff Mason and Kantaro Komiya report, citing remarks Trump made to reporters. On Wednesday, Trump stated that he didn’t want to see the company “go to Japan” causing a 7% drop in the company’s stock value. Following the comment, both companies stated they were collaborating with the administration “to secure a significant investment”, however on Sunday, Trump affirmed his stance, saying, “I don’t think a foreign company should control U.S. Steel.”Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
