Sources say Apple has chosen Samsung Display as the exclusive supplier for the foldable OLED panels, citing Samsung's (SSNLF) technical lead in minimizing screen creasesarguably the make-or-break feature of a folding phone. Mass production is expected to kick off by late 2025 or early 2026, covering a 7.8-inch main display and a 5.5-inch external screen. For investors, this marks a rare moment when Apple ditches its usual playbook of sourcing from multiple suppliers to drive competition.What's striking is who's not on that list: LG Display. Despite being one of Apple's earliest partners in foldable tech, even co-developing prototype panels back in 2016 and forming a dedicated task force in 2017, LG is now sitting on the sidelines. While Apple's history suggests it could bring in LG for future models if sales scale, this first foldable looks like a one-brand show. The move underscores just how high the bar isand how dominant Samsung's foldable portfolio has become in the premium OLED space.For Samsung Display, this deal isn't just about unitsit's about locking in pole position in the next-gen smartphone race. Apple's validation sends a strong signal to the market that Samsung's tech is years ahead when it comes to crease control and panel reliability. If the iPhone Fold takes off, expect this to be the start of a deeper AppleSamsung hardware alignmentand possibly a wake-up call for LG and BOE to rethink their roadmap.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsSign in to access your portfolio
