We also see Q1 earnings results continue to ramp up, but we won’t have the spigots open completely til next week.

This is down from the +0.1% estimate and the prior two months up +0.4%. Subtracting volatile fuel prices, an “unched” headline, 0.0%, is down -30 basis points (bps) from estimates and the previous month’s headline.Year over year, Import Prices reached +0.9%, 60 bps lower than the +1.5% anticipated by analysts and 110 bps lower month over month, from February. Keep in mind, this pricing was all conducted under the specter of a new tariff regime conditioning markets. It’s tough to know exactly how these numbers reflect this directly, but we expect to look back a few months and see clearly where tariff policy took hold.Exports for March were also “unched” month over month, but still +2.4% year over year.
