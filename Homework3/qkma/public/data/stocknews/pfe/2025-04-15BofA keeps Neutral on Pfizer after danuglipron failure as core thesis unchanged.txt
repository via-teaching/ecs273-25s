The firm points out that it has argued that this program has received almost too much attention – not because obesity isn’t important, but because this was only phase 1 data. Without danuglipron, Pfizer’s obesity pipeline now consists of a GIP receptor antagonist in phase 2 and a phase 1 oral GLP-1 in T2D with Nxera Pharma. If the company is committed to obesity, a possible next step could be business development, BofA argues. The firm reiterates a Neutral rating for Pfizer as it believes core thesis remains unchanged.Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks.Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using  Tipranks' Stock Screener.Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
