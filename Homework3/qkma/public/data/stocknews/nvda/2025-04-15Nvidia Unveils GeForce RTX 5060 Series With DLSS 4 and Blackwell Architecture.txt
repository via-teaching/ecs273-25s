GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.According to the company's announcement, the RTX 5060 family introduces DLSS 4's Multi Frame Generation, which uses artificial intelligence to generate up to three extra frames for every traditionally rendered frame.

It also supports features like DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Ray Reconstruction. These technologies are already integrated into more than 100 games and applications.The new cards are aimed at users upgrading from older 60 and 50 class models.

In titles such as Hogwarts Legacy, the company said the RTX 5060 Ti achieves twice the frame rate of the RTX 4060 Ti at 1440p settings, with reduced latency and smoother gameplay.The RTX 5060 desktop cards come in 8GB and 16GB variants and will be available through partners including ASUS, GIGABYTE, MSI, and ZOTAC. Laptops equipped with the RTX 5060 will launch in May from major manufacturers and offer similar improvements in performance and power efficiency, according to Nvidia.The cards feature new Tensor Cores, Shader Cores, Ray Tracing Cores, and GDDR7 VRAM. Nvidia also said users can expect faster video encoding and support for DisplayPort 2.1.The rollout marks Nvidia's continued effort to integrate neural rendering and real-time AI-powered graphics into mainstream gaming hardware.
