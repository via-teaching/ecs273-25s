Concerns over global oil demand worsened after Beijing swapped its chief trade envoy and said that relying on domestic consumption was insufficient to spur growth. In wider markets, warnings by ASML Holdings NV and Nvidia Corp. on the effects of tariffs weighed on US equity futures.China’s downbeat outlook came as Beijing replaced its chief international trade negotiator in a closely watched appointment as traders try to anticipate any possible shifts in China’s stance toward Washington. The shuffle came after President Donald Trump insisted on Tuesday that the ball was in Beijing’s court to start negotiations with Washington.“While we may have seen a peak in headline tariff rates, the intensifying standoff between the US and China is casting a long shadow over global demand expectations,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist for Saxo Markets Pte. “The uncertainty around retaliatory measures and supply chain disruptions is weighing on risk appetite and, in turn, on the oil market.”Crude remains near the lowest in four years, after a sharp drop earlier this month brought about by an onslaught of tariffs and counter-levies between the US and its biggest trading partners. Washington on Tuesday launched a probe into the need for import taxes on critical minerals, while struggling to bridge trade differences this week with the European Union as White House officials said the bulk of the US tariffs imposed on the bloc won’t be removed.Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency on Tuesday slashed its forecasts for global oil consumption this year, and said that supply additions are likely to be more than enough to satisfy demand.The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reported US nationwide crude inventories rose by 2.4 million barrels last week, which would be the third consecutive advance if confirmed by official data later Wednesday. However, the report indicated declines at the oil storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, and in fuel inventories.To get Bloomberg’s Energy Daily newsletter in your inbox, click here.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s AmericaHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff ObsessionThe Beauty Salon Recession IndicatorTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on PurposeTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries©2025 Bloomberg L.P.By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's

(Bloomberg) -- Gold rose to a fresh high as US President Donald Trump ordered a probe that could open up a new front in the global trade war, sparking another retreat from equities and a move toward haven assets.Most Read from BloombergHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?Trump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office SpaceLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs$15 Million Fund Bets Leadership Training Can Improve Chicago PolicingBullion gained as muchSINGAPORE—-China’s economy got a boost in the first quarter from a rush of exports to the U.S. ahead of stiff new tariffs, but growth is set to slow as the trade war between Washington and Beijing heats up.  How serious that slowdown will get depends on how successful Chinese exporters are at finding new markets for goods shut out of the U.S. by sky-high new tariffs.  It also depends on how big a boost to spending Beijing can generate at home to offset weakness overseas.It's been a sea of red in Asia so far on Wednesday, with new U.S. moves turning up the heat in the trade war with China, but at least the losses have been relatively shallow compared with other down days of the past few weeks.  Washington issued new export licensing requirements for Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 artificial intelligence chips to China.  Nvidia's shares slumped 6% in after-hours trading, after it said the move would cost $5.5 billion.(Reuters) -ASML, the world's biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment, said on Wednesday that tariffs were increasing uncertainty around its outlook for 2025 and 2026, but stood by its annual guidance as the race for AI rages on.  CEO Christophe Fouquet said his conversations with customers supported ASML's expectations that 2025 and 2026 would be growth years.  "However, the recent tariff announcements have increased uncertainty in the macro environment," Fouquet said in a statement.The chip maker will take a $5.5 billion charge in the current quarter for H20 inventory and canceled sales.Big Tech stocks are too important to be sacrificed in a trade war but a negotiated peace isn't yet on the table.We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on the Move.

Global oil demand is expected to grow at its slowest rate for five years in 2025 and U.S. production gains will also taper off, due to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on trading partners and their retaliatory moves, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday.  "Investors continue to struggle in finding a catalyst to drive a more meaningful rebound, as global growth is widely expected to slow ahead with U.S. tariffs, which puts oil demand in jeopardy," said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsSign in to access your portfolio
