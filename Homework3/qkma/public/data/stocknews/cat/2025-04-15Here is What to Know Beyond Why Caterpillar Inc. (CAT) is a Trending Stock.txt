So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this construction equipment company have returned -13%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Manufacturing - Construction and Mining industry, which Caterpillar falls in, has lost 12%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Caterpillar is expected to post earnings of $4.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $19.41 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -11.4%. This estimate has changed -1.7% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.69 indicates a change of +11.7% from what Caterpillar is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Caterpillar.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Caterpillar, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.61 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -7.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $62.51 billion and $65.47 billion estimates indicate -3.6% and +4.7% changes, respectively.Caterpillar reported revenues of $16.22 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5%. EPS of $5.14 for the same period compares with $5.23 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.64 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.57%. The EPS surprise was +3.42%.Over the last four quarters, Caterpillar surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Caterpillar is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers.

However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
