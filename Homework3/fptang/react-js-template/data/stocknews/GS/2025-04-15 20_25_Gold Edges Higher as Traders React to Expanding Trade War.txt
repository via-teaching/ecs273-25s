(Bloomberg) -- Gold edged toward the record high set on Monday, as the Trump administration pressed ahead with probes that could broaden the US’s sweeping trade war.

The US Commerce Department said Monday it had initiated probes into the national security impact of semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports, a precursor to imposing tariffs. The precious metal has rallied by more than a fifth this year as the worsening trade war has damped prospects for global growth, eroded trust in usually-safe US assets and roiled financial markets. Leading banks remain optimistic about bullion’s prospects over the coming quarters as investors add to holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded funds and central banks continue to accumulate the metal. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has forecast that prices will rally to $4,000 an ounce by mid-2026. Gold may also find support from strong demand in China, the world’s biggest bullion market. As the trade war has intensified, there’s been a surge in speculative trading, as well as inflows into local ETFs. “Yuan devaluation, macroeconomic volatility, and rising dedollarization rhetoric are classic, powerful drivers of gold demand” in China, said Justin Lin, a Sydney-based analyst at Global X ETFs. Globally, “a further rally will likely require a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve, or clearer signs of a material slowdown in the US economy,” he said. Gold rose by 0.6% to $3,230.36 an ounce at 4:18 p.m. in New York. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was up 0.3% after a five-day drop. Silver inched lower, while platinum and palladium gained. --With assistance from Yvonne Yue Li.
