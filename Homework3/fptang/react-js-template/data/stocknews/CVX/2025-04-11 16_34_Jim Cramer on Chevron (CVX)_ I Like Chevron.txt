We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Recently Talked About These 9 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently. On Wednesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, shared his thoughts on the market turmoil of the week and provided some valuable lessons. He emphasized that no one ever made a profit by panicking. Cramer pointed out how many investors had thrown in the towel during the downturn. “Yeah, what happens is they get out and then it rallies big like today, and that’s the end. Bye bye. Learn to take the pain. Staying the course is how you make the biggest money.” READ ALSO: 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently and Jim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks. Cramer noted how, on Tuesday night, anyone holding stocks felt disheartened and as if they had lost substantial sums. He then pointed out that in contrast, those who were shorting the market, including many hedge funds, went to bed feeling victorious. However, Cramer had a different perspective and highlighted that some of the short-sellers, who had bet against the market just before the high opening on Wednesday, might have felt smart in the moment. But he quickly reminded viewers that while bulls and bears can make money, he commented that “hogs, those who staged short were pigs, plain and simple. He then went on to say: “The president likes, no, no, he loves drama. He’s gonna love drama for his whole darn presidency. That’s one constant from his first term.” Cramer said that investors should not expect any certainty from the White House. Hoping for “certainty” from President Trump, he said, would be “kind of nuts” at this point. His advice to investors was simple: when the noise gets overwhelming, “just turn it off”. “So let me give you the bottom line on this one of the most exciting days of our lives: I don’t think that things are all that difficult. They’re not COVID difficult. Now I think that you’re dealing with manmade crises. It turns out that one of these manmade crises was easily reversible, as we’ve said over and over again, and told you that when you see stocks in the blast zone rally, it pays to realize that good things, not just bad things can happen too.” For this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81 A caller asked if they should keep Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Cramer remarked: “Yeah, definitely keep Chevron. It’s got a 4.6% yield. It keeps buying back stock. You saw the way it bounced off the bottom today…. I think Mike Wirth’s doing a terrific job. The only problem I would tell you is I’m not a bull on oil, but you came to me and you wanted an oil and I come back and I say, if you want an oil, then I like Mike Wirth. I like Chevron.” Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is engaged in the exploration, production, transportation, and refining of oil and gas. It also focuses on manufacturing petrochemicals and renewable fuels. Cramer was similarly bullish on the company last week as he said, “That’s why I say you look at a Chevron. With a really great yield and it’s been a big winner.” Overall, CVX ranks 3rd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently.
