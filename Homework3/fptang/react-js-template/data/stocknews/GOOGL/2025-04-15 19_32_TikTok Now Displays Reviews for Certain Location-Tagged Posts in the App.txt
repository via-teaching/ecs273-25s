              TikTok’s taking another step towards expanding its in-stream business listings, with the addition of business reviews on selected, location-tagged videos in the app.  As you can see in this example, posted by app researcher Jonah Manzano, some TikTok comment sections now also have a separate “Reviews” tab, which showcases user reviews for businesses at the tagged location. Some of these are for general locations and tourist attractions, while others are for specific businesses, with viewers able to upvote each review direct in-stream. You can also tap through on any review to be taken to the reviewers’ TikTok profile. As reported by TechCrunch, the addition seemingly builds on TikTok’s effort to compete with Google on Search. Over time, TikTok has become a much bigger source of discovery, with young users turning to the app to research all sorts of products and experiences via direct creator insight.  Indeed, back in 2022, a Google executive noted that "almost 40% of young people, when they’re looking for a place for lunch, they don’t go to Google Maps or Search, they go to TikTok or Instagram." Google still remains the key destination for discovery, but TikTok is undeniably gaining more traction in this respect, which Google had seemingly been looking to tap into via a similar integration at one stage. As you can see in this example, TikTok has also tested similar review and business info displays powered by Google Maps, though this latest variation no longer has the Google branding, which suggests that TikTok is now going it alone on this element. Maybe Google decided to nix that project, or maybe TikTok felt that it was better to build its own database. Which could also better align the app with another development in its broader in-stream shopping push.  In-app shopping is where the Chinese version of TikTok now generates the vast majority of its income, and it’s been trying to implement the same in Western markets, and it is steadily gaining traction on in-app sales. But then again, in the U.S. market, it’s about to take a significant hit. Many of TikTok’s current item listings are for products sourced from China, and as such, Trump’s tariffs are about to boost the prices of these items by a lot. Which means that TikTok will probably need to look elsewhere to maintain its momentum for in-stream purchases. And services listings, including food delivery, could be the next element it integrates.   It already offers services in the Chinese version of the app, expanding the range of ways in which users can spend. More money flowing through the app means more opportunity for expanded sales, and it could be that these new review listings will help to drive more interest in its eventual in-app services listings.  Either way, it’s an interesting addition, which could help to improve the utility of the app.   TikTok’s review listings are available for videos tagged in a limited number of locations at this stage.
