Ovintiv Inc.OVV reported first-quarter 2025 adjusted earnings per share of $1.42, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20. The beat was due to improved natural gas pricing. However, the bottom line slightly decreased from the year-ago level of $1.44 due to lower realized oil prices and a rise in total expenses during the quarter. (See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.) The Denver, CO-based oil and gas exploration and production company’s total revenues of $2.4 billion increased 1.1% from the year-ago quarter’s figure and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3%.  The increase in revenues was driven by higher contributions from product and service sales.

While we have discussed OVV’s first-quarter results in detail, let us take a look at three other key reports in this space. Oil and gas equipment and services provider,Liberty EnergyLBRT, reported a first-quarter 2025 adjusted net income of 4 cents per share, which marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. Liberty's outperformance indicated operational efficiencies as well as increased utilization of frac and wireline fleets. However, the bottom line underperformed the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of 48 cents due to a decline in service activity. As of March 31, Liberty had approximately $24.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. The pressure pumper’s long-term debt of $210 million represented a debt-to-capitalization of 9.6%. Another oil and gas equipment and services provider,Halliburton CompanyHAL, posted first-quarter 2025 adjusted net income per share of 60 cents. The figure met with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but was down from the year-ago quarter’s profit of 76 cents (adjusted). The numbers reflect softer activity in the region of North America, partly offset by international growth. Meanwhile, Halliburton’s revenues of $5.4 billion decreased 6.7% year over year but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.3 billion. As of March 31, 2025, Halliburton had approximately $1.8 billion in cash/cash equivalents and $7.2 billion in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 40.8.
