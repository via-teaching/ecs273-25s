Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) rebuts Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)exec's claim of search decline, saying overall queriesincluding those from Apple devicescontinue to grow and sending shares up 1.7% premarket. In a statement, Google pushed back on Eddy Cue's testimony that Safari searches fell for the first time in Aprilsomething that has never happened in 20 yearsinsisting instead that total query volume is rising across browsers, the Google app, voice and Google Lens. The company highlighted ongoing feature upgrades that make Search more useful for more queries and teased more innovations at Google I/O. Cue's remarks came during the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust trial, where he also signaled Apple is exploring AI-driven search options in Safari, mentioning early talks with Perplexity AI and Anthropic's Claude. His comments knocked nearly $200 billion off Google's market cap before today's rebound. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai separately told the court he expects to finalize an agreement by midyear to bring Google's Gemini AI service to new iPhones, underscoring the companies' intertwined dynamics even amid competition concerns. Why it matters: Google's forceful pushback underscores its confidence in Search's resilienceand reassures investors that its core ad and data business remains intact despite high-profile legal challenges and rising AI-powered alternatives. Investors will watch for query-growth metrics and new Search features unveiled at Google I/O in late May to gauge whether Google can maintain its lead as AI chatbots gain traction. As of May 8, 2025, Alphabet has a GF Value of $175.96, suggesting the stock is modestly undervalued. The current price trades below the fair value estimate, implying potential upside if fundamentals hold. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.
