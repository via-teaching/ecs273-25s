Alphabetsaw its share price rise by 3% over the last month. Several factors may have influenced this move. The company's announcement of significant increases in both dividend and share buyback plans on April 23 likely improved investor sentiment. The subsequent release of strong earnings results on April 24, showing robust increases in sales and net income, would have further boosted confidence. Additionally, the resolution of a new U.S.-U.K. trade deal provided a lift to broader market sentiment, aligning with Alphabet's rise. A proposal for a human rights impact report filed on May 7 might have had a more neutral to negative influence, adding a layer of scrutiny to its operations. Overall, these elements collectively contributed to Alphabet's share price performance, reflecting broader market trends. Buy, Hold or Sell Alphabet?

The recent changes in Alphabet’s dividend and share buyback plans, coupled with robust earnings results and the advantageous U.S.-U.K. trade deal, reinforce the company's drive towards scalable growth. Over the past five years, Alphabet’s total return, including share price appreciation and dividends, reached 125.62%. This long-term gain significantly outpaces its recent 3% share price rise, indicating consistent value creation over a prolonged period. However, over the past year, Alphabet's performance did not keep pace with the US Interactive Media and Services industry return of 1%. The company's strategic emphasis on AI, highlighted by the release of the Gemini 2.5 model and AI infrastructure improvements, suggests potential revenue boosts, particularly from Google Cloud and innovative advertising solutions. Analysts estimate a 10.4% annual revenue growth over the next three years. As Alphabet continues to develop its AI capabilities, such initiatives are expected to bolster its market positioning, potentially lifting earnings forecasts like the projected rise to US$140.1 billion by April 2028. In light of these developments, Alphabet's current share price of US$160.16 shows a substantial discount to the consensus analyst price target of US$202.12. This represents a 20.8% potential upside, reflecting positive sentiment based on future earnings growth, despite varying analyst opinions. Investors should weigh these aspects in context of their investment strategies and risk tolerance. Our expertly prepared valuation report Alphabet implies its share price may be lower than expected.
