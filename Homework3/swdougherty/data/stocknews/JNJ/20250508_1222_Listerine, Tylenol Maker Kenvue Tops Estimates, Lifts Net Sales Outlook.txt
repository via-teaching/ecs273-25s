Gabby Jones / Bloomberg via Getty Images Shares of Kenvue (KVUE) rose in early Thursday trading after the maker of Band-Aid, Tylenol, and Listerine reported first-quarter results better than analysts' estimates. The former consumer-focused segment of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.24 on net sales of $3.74 billion. Both metrics declined from a year ago but by less than analysts polled by Visible Alpha had projected. The consumer products maker said it now expects 2025 net sales growth of 1% to 3%, up from its prior forecast of between a 1% decline and a 1% increase, while its organic sales growth forecast remains unchanged at 2% to 4% growth. However, adjusted operating income margin is expected to decline rather than improve, "reflecting the estimated impact of tariffs," while adjusted EPS is projected to be "about flat," down from flat to a 2% increase. Kenvue said it is "working to reduce the financial impact of tariffs through a number of mitigation actions." Separately, Kenvue said Amit Banati will succeed Paul Ruh as CFO, effective next Monday. Banati most recently was CFO at cereal maker Kellanova (K). Kenvue shares rose more than 6% just after markets opened. They entered Thursday up about 8% this year.
