New social impact platform J&J CareCommunity aims to collaboratively help address global nursing challenges NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., May 08, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Johnson & Johnson today announced the expansion of its efforts to champion the nursing workforce and improve access to quality care for communities around the world. These efforts are part of J&J CareCommunity, a new social impact platform that focuses the resources and expertise of J&J and J&J Foundation to support nurses at every step of their career journey and strengthen health systems worldwide. The expansion aims to help address the global shortfall of nurses, which will reach approximately 4.5 million by 2030, driven in part by burnout and low morale, contributing to a significant gap in care and poorer patient outcomes. "For healthcare to work, it takes nurses. They are leaders, innovators and changemakers within our health systems. J&J CareCommunity enables us to double down in our efforts to support nurses at this pivotal point. Together with our partners, we aim to equip nurses with the skills and support they need to drive meaningful change for patients around the world," said Vanessa Broadhurst, Executive Vice President, Global Corporate Affairs at Johnson & Johnson. Accelerating Nurse Education and Innovation through Global Flagship Programs Flagship J&J CareCommunity programs advance solutions to elevate, empower and equip nurses in collaboration with leading academic institutions, health organizations and local authorities. These programs include: Together with theUniversity of Pennsylvania School of Nursing and Wharton Executive Education, J&J is announcing the 2025 class of J&J Nurse Innovation Fellows*, a groundbreaking, one-year, team-based fellowship for nurse leaders focused on nurse-led innovation and leadership to drive transformative change."Nurses are innovators on the front lines of care," said Marion Leary, PhD, MPH, RN, Director of Innovation at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing. "By investing in their creativity and leadership, we strengthen the profession and tap into critical expertise. Our collaboration with Johnson & Johnson helps scale nurse-led solutions that drive meaningful change for patients and communities." Building on 25 years of impact, J&J Foundation and theAga Khan University School of Nursing & Midwifery East Africaare continuing to expand opportunities for nursing education and leadership across East Africa.

To date, the initiative has trained 2,880 nurses from 24 countries, reaching more than 18,800 patients."Nurses are the heart and strength of our healthcare system — vigilant guardians, compassionate advocates, and skilled navigators through each patient’s health care journey," said Saber Mostafa, Clinical Nurse Educator at Operation Smile. "Nursing development trainings are essential in equipping them with the expertise and confidence they need to advance their professional growth and deliver high-quality, compassionate care." A partnership betweenWorld Continuing Education Alliance(WCEA) and J&J Foundation is doubling down on its impact after helping nearly one million nurses in more than 60 low-to-middle income countries access more than 70 million hours of training via low-bandwidth and digital platforms optimized for offline learning.
