Dividendinvesting has long been a favored strategy for those seeking passive income and long-termwealthgrowth.
Unlike depending solely on capital appreciation, dividend-paying stocks and funds provide regular cash payouts, allowing investors to compound their returns by reinvesting dividends or using them to cover expenses. Many investors are drawn to dividends because they offer a tangible return, namely getting paid simply for holding shares.

A disciplined strategy that entails buying consistently, reinvesting dividends, often through dividend reinvestment plans, and holding for the long term can turn even modest monthly contributions into a notable income stream over time. This strategy, often called the “snowball effect,” leverages compounding to boost portfolio growth.
One investor who has adopted this method is a 34-year-old Reddit user who has grown his portfolio to $114,000 in just five years by investing as much as he could through a dividend reinvestment plan. In turn, his portfolio is now generating $700 to $800 in monthly dividends. His goal is to eventually live off his dividend income while continuing to grow his investments.

The investor keeps this portfolio in a taxable brokerage account for flexibility, allowing him to access the dividends if needed, although he mentioned that wasn't the case so far.
“I’m planning on retiring in 15 years. My next goal is $1,000 a month. I'm in the process of growing a business and it would be nice to be able to pay a couple of bills with my dividends if I ever need to (hasn't happened yet). I'm much more likely to save and reinvest every month because I get paid every month, how fun is that? It doesn't have to be the most optimal but it's definitely great motivation to keep the snowball rolling,” he wrote on Reddit.
The investor's portfolio consists of three key ETFs, each offering a different mix of income and growth. Let’s take a closer look at each below.
Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF
Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE:SCHD) is a passively managed ETF that tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. It focuses on high-quality U.S. companies with strong dividend histories and solid fundamentals like consistent cash flow and strong balance sheets. SCHD is loved by investors because it has a long-term performance, a low expense ratio, and a long, solid history. The ETF generates approximately 4.22% in dividend yield per year.

JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF
JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSE:JEPI) combines equity investing with an options overlay strategy. It holds U.S. large-cap stocks and writes covered calls to generate extra income. This creates a high-yielding, lower-volatility product while also maintaining some exposure to stock appreciation. It's ideal for investors seeking above-average yields with lower volatility than pure equity funds. JEPI pays investors around 8.14% in dividends per year.
JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF
JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ)​ is similar to JEPI but focused on Nasdaq-100 stocks. The ETF combines growth tech exposure with income generation through options strategies, making it riskier due to its tech concentration and shorter track record. JEPQ also uses covered calls for income, making it a high-yield ETF with exposure to growth sectors. Investors get paid around 11.94% in annual dividends.

Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase last week both said they didn’t see indicators that companies were scrambling to do big draw-downs on credit lines to raise cash.

The Trump administration's tariff announcement on April 2 served as a stark reminder of this concept as it sent global equities into a tailspin.

Let's explore why Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) could make excellent long-term bets.
