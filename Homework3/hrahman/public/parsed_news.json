Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that \u201cwhat gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things\u201d. Buffett\u2019sBerkshirepicks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.\nOverall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio. So, let\u2019s take a look at the top Goldman Sachs value stocks.\nA team of data experts gathered around a computer monitor analyzing customer data.\nTo compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm\u2019s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against other machine-learning stocks.\nGrand View Research reported that the global machine-learning market was valued at $36.73 billion in 2022. It\u2019s now expected to grow at a 34.8% CAGR from 2023 to 2030. Machine learning helps machines and systems learn from experience instead of through explicit programming. It uses algorithms to improve and analyze vast amounts of complex data to make informed decisions. Machine learning is quickly progressing as AI is rapidly expanding and transforming how businesses and individuals operate. These technological advancements are revolutionizing consumer experiences, and enabling convenient creation of digital services, products, and optimized supply chains. With this, startups can focus on specific solutions while larger companies can deliver comprehensive AI platforms.\nOn April 10, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 to discuss the cost of AI and what has to happen to bring it down. Jassy emphasized that the growth in data center demand is now so significant that there is no foreseen attenuation here, even with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties under tariffs. While there\u2019s a general belief that the emergence of DeepSeek could now reduce the need for extensive data centers, processing power, and energy consumption previously forecasted at different tech companies, Jassy thinks that DeepSeek\u2019s introduction did not disrupt any of this. Despite cost reductions that occurred have already over time, AI deployment still requires significant investment. He thinks that the current AI operations are expensive due to chip costs and other factors, but big techs, including his own company, would welcome any reductions in AI costs for customers moving forward.\nJassy underscored the demand for data centers despite tariff impacts and reflected optimism regarding lowering costs, which would potentially drive innovation and expanded use of AI across industries. AI is still limited and requires substantial human oversight as of now but it has massive potential across various sectors.\nWe sifted through ETFs and financial media reports to compile a list of the top ML stocks.

A second card, the GeForce RTX 5060, will follow in May, along with corresponding laptops.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nAccording to the company's announcement, the RTX 5060 family introduces DLSS 4's Multi Frame Generation, which uses artificial intelligence to generate up to three extra frames for every traditionally rendered frame. The result, Nvidia said, is up to an eightfold increase in frame rates compared to traditional rendering.\nNvidia said the transformer AI model powering DLSS 4 is trained on high-resolution gameplay, improving both image clarity and performance. It also supports features like DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Ray Reconstruction. These technologies are already integrated into more than 100 games and applications.\nThe new cards are aimed at users upgrading from older 60 and 50 class models. Nvidia said there are over 50 million users of these previous-generation cards, and the RTX 5060 family offers a significant performance leap. In titles such asHogwarts Legacy, the company said the RTX 5060 Ti achieves twice the frame rate of the RTX 4060 Ti at 1440p settings, with reduced latency and smoother gameplay.\nThe RTX 5060 desktop cards come in 8GB and 16GB variants and will be available through partners including ASUS, GIGABYTE, MSI, and ZOTAC. Laptops equipped with the RTX 5060 will launch in May from major manufacturers and offer similar improvements in performance and power efficiency, according to Nvidia.\nThe cards feature new Tensor Cores, Shader Cores, Ray Tracing Cores, and GDDR7 VRAM. Nvidia also said users can expect faster video encoding and support for DisplayPort 2.1.\nThe rollout marks Nvidia's continued effort to integrate neural rendering and real-time AI-powered graphics into mainstream gaming hardware.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 113\nCommenting on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) during the episode, Cramer said:\n\u201cTuesday, we hear from two more big banks and by this time, I gotta tell you, when we see the numbers from Bank of America and Citigroup, our eyes are going to glaze over. They shouldn\u2019t but they will. I think that Bank of America will be the usual fine self and Citigroup\u2019s gotten so loved that it\u2019s probably going to roar no matter what is said, such is the admiration for CEO Jane Fraser and she certainly earned it.\u201d\nBank of America (NYSE:BAC) is a long-standing financial institution. It offers services such as savings accounts, checking accounts, loans, investment management, and wealth planning. Hardman Johnston Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in itsQ4 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is the second largest bank in the developed world and operates the third largest branch network in the US. With 86% of revenues coming from the US, the bank is a clear beneficiary of the lower regulatory environment expected from the incoming administration. The company\u2019s business is highly diversified across retail, commercial, wealth management, and investment banking, with significant scale across all verticals. Management believes there is a big opportunity going forward in growing and monetizing its mass retail client base. Wealth is another huge opportunity, with the Merrill Lynch platform enabling customers to make more transactions and purchase additional products. Lastly, Bank of America has an opportunity to increase efficiency through cost reduction and online banking. Our expectation is for the bank\u2019s ROE to move significantly higher, driving EPS growth and higher multiples.\u201d\nOverall, BACranks 3rdon our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of BAC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Sources say Apple has chosen Samsung Display as the exclusive supplier for the foldable OLED panels, citing Samsung's (SSNLF) technical lead in minimizing screen creasesarguably the make-or-break feature of a folding phone. Mass production is expected to kick off by late 2025 or early 2026, covering a 7.8-inch main display and a 5.5-inch external screen. For investors, this marks a rare moment when Apple ditches its usual playbook of sourcing from multiple suppliers to drive competition.\nWhat's striking is who's not on that list: LG Display. Despite being one of Apple's earliest partners in foldable tech, even co-developing prototype panels back in 2016 and forming a dedicated task force in 2017, LG is now sitting on the sidelines. While Apple's history suggests it could bring in LG for future models if sales scale, this first foldable looks like a one-brand show. The move underscores just how high the bar isand how dominant Samsung's foldable portfolio has become in the premium OLED space.\nFor Samsung Display, this deal isn't just about unitsit's about locking in pole position in the next-gen smartphone race. Apple's validation sends a strong signal to the market that Samsung's tech is years ahead when it comes to crease control and panel reliability. If the iPhone Fold takes off, expect this to be the start of a deeper AppleSamsung hardware alignmentand possibly a wake-up call for LG and BOE to rethink their roadmap.\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus.\nThe US should form a transatlantic alliance with the EU amid trade tensions and tariff impositions before it goes to the negotiating table with China, says Mathias D\u00f6pfner, Axel Springer CEO.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\nOn Friday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer outlined what investors should focus on in the week, especially pointing to earnings reports from major banks.\n\u201cRumor, innuendo, intrigue these are the stuff of great novels, of fabulous miniseries, riveting plays, and now they\u2019re the stuff of the stock market.\u201d\nREAD ALSO:Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocksand10 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar Recently.\nHe noted the chaotic nature of the current environment and remarked that \u201cthis tape has it all,\u201d and emphasized how unpredictable developments from the White House have added to the turbulence. Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes.\n\u201cTrillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,\u201d he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, \u201cExcept this isn\u2019t an eight-part blockbuster, it\u2019s our money.\u201d Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday\u2019s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic.\nCramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a \u201cliberation day bottom,\u201d a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, \u201cNot sure, I\u2019m just not sure.\u201d He added:\n\u201cHave you ever noticed the weekends don\u2019t provide relaxation anymore because the president\u2019s got advisors? He\u2019s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He\u2019s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime\u2026. Monday\u2019s trading, well, let\u2019s just say that it looks like that it\u2019s earning season so it\u2019s gonna be even harder than usual.\u201d\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 186\nComing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Cramer noted:\n\u201cA few minutes after 2:00 AM on Thursday, we get to listen to Taiwan Semiconductor talk. Now, lots of people think that this call has become a proxy for NVIDIA, this is NVIDIA\u2019s foundry. If it\u2019s strong, Nvidia flies. Now, that linkage is now antediluvian and it hasn\u2019t held up under closed scrutiny in the last couple of quarters. Well, I\u2019m going to listen but this time only for the color on the entire semiconductor space. Not as a one-for-one for Nvidia.\u201d\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) specializes in manufacturing, packaging, testing, and selling integrated circuits and other semiconductor products. During March 24\u2019s episode of Squawk on the Street, Cramer remarked:\n\u201cStargate and Taiwan Semi are the two that matter the most. Taiwan Semi if they can build the two-nano, the small ones, not the large ones that go into cars. If Taiwan Semi works out, then that\u2019s a hedge against what we read about every day in the papers about what the Chinese government is doing.\u201d\nOverall, TSMranks 11thon our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sparred Tuesday with a Federal Trade Commission attorney over the meaning of emails the Facebook founder wrote about why he wanted to acquire Instagram, as a historic antitrust trial alleging Meta illegally monopolized the social media market went into its second day.\nZuckerberg testified on the second day in the trial that could force Meta to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups the tech giant bought more than a decade ago which have since grown into social media powerhouses.\nDaniel Matheson, who is leading the FTC's case against Meta, contends that Zuckerberg bought Instagram because he saw it as a threat to his company, not because he thought he could make it thrive.\nWhile questioning Zuckerberg on Tuesday morning, Matheson noted that he had referred to Instagram as being a \u201crapidly growing, threatening, network.\u201d\nBut Zuckerberg, who is the first witness called in the trial, said while Matheson was able to show documents in court that indicated his concern about Instagram's growth, he also had many conversations about how excited his company was to acquire Instagram to make a better product.\nZuckerberg pushed back against Matheson's contention that the reason for buying the company was to neutralize a threat.\n\u201cI think that that mischaracterizes what the email was,\" Zuckerberg said.\nIn his questioning of Zuckerberg, Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before the acquisition of Instagram.\nWhile acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company.\nMatheson also brought up a February 2012 message in which Zuckerberg wrote to the former chief financial officer of Facebook that Instagram and Path, a social networking app, already had created meaningful networks that could be \u201cvery disruptive to us.\u201d\nZuckerberg testified that the message was written in the context of a broad discussion about whether they should buy companies to accelerate their own developments.\nZuckerberg also testified that buying the company, taking it off the market and building their own version of it was \u201ca reasonable thing to do.\u201d\nThe trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump\u2019s FTC\u2019s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump\u2019s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.\nFacebook bought Instagram \u2014 which was a photo-sharing app with no ads \u2014 for $1 billion in 2012.\nInstagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller \u201cacqui-hires\u201d \u2014 a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.\nWhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged.\nHowever, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta\u2019s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple\u2019s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.\nMeta, meanwhile, says the FTC\u2019s lawsuit \u201cdefies reality.\u201d\n\u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission\u2019s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,\" the company said in a statement.\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg is presiding over the case. Late last year, he denied Meta\u2019s request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.\nPARIS (Reuters) -Nearly three dozen global pharmaceutical companies, in a letter to the head of the European Commission, demanded help to maintain operations in the EU despite threatened U.S. tariffs on imports, including measures to compensate them for the cost of pharmaceutical innovations, French business newspaper Les Echos reported on Tuesday.  In the letter sent to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the companies -- including Pfizer, Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca -- said they face cost disadvantages in Europe versus the United States, where drugs are sold at prices that on average are twice that of some European countries, such as France, Les Echos reported.\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg considered spinning off popular photo-sharing app Instagram in 2018 in anticipation of possible antitrust scrutiny, according to a document shown at a trial in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday.  The document was shown during Zuckerberg's second day of testimony at the high-stakes trial, in which the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is seeking to unwind Meta's acquisitions of prized assets Instagram and WhatsApp.  \"I wonder if we should consider the extreme step of spinning Instagram out as a separate company,\" Zuckerberg said in a memo discussing potential strategies for how to reorganize the social media company's family of apps.\nMoney market account interest rates today are still well above historical norms.

On the morning of the 9th, Trump posted on social media that it was a \u201cgreat time to buy.\u201d About four hours later, he announced he was suspending tariffs, propelling the S&P 500 index to a 9.5% gain, its biggest rally since 2008.\nGreene\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nGreene, one of the first lawmakers to file a disclosure since Trump announced his tariffs, is an active trader in stocks, filing eight disclosures so far this year. She\u2019s been particularly bullish on the semiconductor and tech industries. Her sale of Treasuries, though, was the first time she\u2019s sold after buying more than $500,000 of the government-backed securities since the beginning of 2025.\nCongressional Democrats have urged investigations into whether people connected to Trump profited from the timing of the tariff announcements.\nIn a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she did not know which officials may have had advance knowledge, but called it \u201cunconscionable\u201d that insiders may have profited from the market volatility.\nThe disclosure reports only require members to list values of transactions in broad ranges, and do not contain specific times of execution or cost basis, so it\u2019s unclear precisely how many of Greene\u2019s trades happened before Trump broke the news of the tariff pause.\nBut at least $11,011 to $165,000 in purchases came on April 8. As of 11:20 a.m. Tuesday in New York, shares of Blackstone, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Tesla traded higher than at any point on that day.\nOver the two days, her stock purchases totaled $21,021 to $315,000. She sold $50,001 to $100,000 of US Treasuries on April 8.\nAmong the other names in Greene\u2019s purchases were chipmakers Nvidia Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., along with apparel companies Lululemon Athletica Inc. and Nike Inc.\n(Updates with Greene\u2019s trading history in fifth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM\u2019s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump\u2019s America\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump\u2019s Tariff Obsession\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n(Bloomberg) -- Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade.

    "content": "URL: https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/jj-projects-400m-tariff-hit-but-raises-sales-outlook/?.tsrc=rss\nContent:\nJ&J is projecting a $400m hit due to US tariffs in 2025, but reaffirmed its profit outlook while raising its sales forecast.\nJohnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine (J&J) addressed the potential impact of pharmaceutical tariffs during its Q1 2025 earnings call, as the US government intensifies its scrutiny of foreign drug supply chains. The company\u2019s chief financial officer Joseph Wolk said the company expects a $400m cost tied to newly proposed and existing tariffs, with the largest burden stemming from China\u2019s retaliatory duties on US-origin goods.\nWith the possibility of pharma-specific tariffs looming and the Department of Commerce announcing the launch of a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceutical imports on 14 April, investors were watching closely for commentary from J&J on US trade policy. The investigation gives President Donald Trump 90 days to determine whether tariffs should be imposed on national security grounds.\nThe gold standard of business intelligence.\nFind out more\nCEO Joaquin Duato said the company is analysing the Section 232 process, noting it had been anticipated and would be treated as a normal regulatory development. \u201cIt\u2019s important that companies in healthcare partner with the administration to look to mitigate some of the vulnerabilities that exist today in our healthcare supply chain,\u201d Duato said.\nA new survey from GlobalData aims to gain insights into deploying new technology in clinical research.\n\u201cWe plan to do it in this process to make sure that we have enough manufacturing capacity here in the US to be able to address multiple scenarios. We want to be deferential to the administration and their process,\u201d he added.\nMany large pharma companies like MSD and Novartis have announced plans to increase manufacturing activity in the US against the backdrop of these tariff announcements, and J&Jannounced its own $55m US investmentin March 2025.\n\u201cSince President Trump\u2019s 2017 tax reform, the investment in manufacturing \u2013 both in medtech and in pharmaceuticals \u2013 has significantly increased. When you think about our recent announcement of investing $55bn over the next four years at the completion of this investment plan, essentially all our advanced medicines that are used in the US will be manufactured in the US,\u201d said Duato.\nJ&J indicated that most of the projected $400m tariff impact will affect itsMedtech division. The total includes duties from China, as well as import tariffs from Mexico and Canada not excluded under the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement (USMCA). Wolk noted that mitigation strategies are limited due to existing price controls and contractual agreements, particularly in the pharmaceutical segment. Tariff-related costs will primarily be recorded as inventory before impacting future profit and loss statements.\nDespite the headwinds, J&J posted Q1 results above analyst expectations. Revenue for the quarter rose by 2.4% to $21.9bn, with operational growth of 4.2% and adjusted operational growth of 3.3%. Oncology products, including multiple myeloma drug Darzalex (daratumumab), remained key contributors.\nThe company raised its 2025 sales forecast by $700m to $92bn at the midpoint, reflecting the addition of Caplyta (lumateperone) following its$14.6bn acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies. However, J&J lowered its adjusted operational EPS growth projection to 6.2%, down from 8.7%, citing dilution from the acquisition. Adjusted reported EPS growth remains unchanged at 6.2%, consistent with guidance first issued in January 2025.\nJ&J also reported regulatory approvals for two key therapies in 1Q: the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)cleared Tremfya (guselkumab)for Crohn\u2019s disease, and theEuropean Commission (EC) approvedRybrevant (amivantamab-vmjw) for specific lung cancer indications.\nMedtech operational sales rose 4.1%, with growth driven by cardiovascular and general surgery segments. Orthopaedics showed weakness, particularly in spine and sports medicine.\nLegal challenges remain ongoing. In April 2025, a Texas court blocked J&J\u2019s attempt to resolve talc-related liabilities via a bankruptcy filing by its subsidiary Red River Talc. J&J previouslyexpressed its intention to defend itselfagainst the claims, which it insists are \u201cmeritless\u201d and \u201cpremised on junk science\u201d. J&J intends to recover up to $7bn from legal reserves.\nThe gold standard of business intelligence.\nFind out more\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\nPharma Technology Focus : Pharmaceutical Technology Focus (monthly)\nThematic Take (monthly)\nVisit ourPrivacy Policyfor more information about our services, how we may use, process and share your personal data, including information on your rights in respect of your personal data and how you can unsubscribe from future marketing communications.

He noted that many chipmakers could see upside this quarter due to early ordering driven by tariff concerns. However, Schafer expects company outlooks to reflect ongoing trade war uncertainty and limited visibility into the second half of the year.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nNvidia, in particular, is expected to have sold roughly 40,000 NVL72 units during the quarter, despite a slow start. That comes as cloud service providers are still forecast to boost capital spending by 40% in 2025.\nWhile most chips are currently exempt from new tariffs under the Trump administration, Schafer warned that additional sector-specific duties may still be introduced. If so, that could dampen consumer demand for products like smartphones and PCs.\nAmid broader market volatility, Schafer also trimmed his price targets on several names, including Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI), Marvell, NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), Veeco Instruments (NASDAQ:VECO), and Monolithic Power, citing valuation compression.\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus.\nWe recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid Market Volatility.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best oil stocks.\nAfter an encouraging start to the year, the energy sector is once again lagging behind the overall market. At the time of writing this piece, the broader energy sector has slid by almost 8.2% since the beginning of 2025, against declines of around 7.9% by the wider market. The principal reason behind this fall is the decline in the global prices of oil, which have plunged by almost 14.5% since the beginning of the year.\nREAD NEXT:10 Best Clean Energy Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires\nThe continued uncertainty surrounding the ongoing tariff war and the recent decision by OPEC+ to increase supply in May have taken a toll on the global price, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price now hovering around a 3-year low of $61.5. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecasted WTI price to average $63.88 per barrel for 2025 before dropping to an average of $57.48 next year. Such a sharp decline in prices could threaten US oil production growth this year. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the US oil industry needs prices between $61 and $70 per barrel to be profitable.\nThe escalating trade tensions between the US and China have also raised the prospect of a global economic slowdown, potentially leading to a lower-than-forecasted consumption of oil. In its latest report, the EIA now expects global oil consumption to increase by 900,000 b/d in 2025 and 1 million b/d in 2026, down by 400,000 b/d and 100,000 b/d, respectively, from its initial forecast last month. The decrease in demand, coupled with increasing production, will continue putting pressure on crude prices, forcing many industry players to cut back activity to maintain investor payouts.\nThe American oil and gas sector is also frustrated by the back and forth trade policies of President Trump and is questioning how they align with his \u2018drill, baby, drill\u2019 mandate to further boost production. According to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, nearly a third of oil executives have stated that their business outlook has worsened since the end of 2024. Moreover, the imposition of the 25% tariff on steel and aluminum has already led to an estimated 4% increase in costs for drilling a well.\nThe pressing issues surrounding the global oil trade have forced the industry to shift focus to its second major source of revenue \u2013 natural gas. In contrast to oil, the benchmark US natural gas price at Henry Hub has surged by more than 123% since last year and by almost 18% since the beginning of 2025. The uptick comes as a result of slowing output in 2024, booming LNG exports, and fast-depleting inventories during the coldest winter in six years. Moreover, natural gas has emerged as a leading candidate to power the ongoing AI boom and its accompanying data centers, with many providers now even aiming to surpass utilities and supply directly to these power-hungry facilities.\nAlso, despite the broad concerns, many billionaires continue to invest and remain bullish on the oil sector. A great example is how Warren Buffett\u2019sBerkshire Hathawaymaintains significant holdings in multiple oil majors and even recently invested hundreds of millions of dollars in an oil and gas giant over the last few months.\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\nTo collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of billionaires\u2019 stock holdings and picked the top 10 companies operating in the oil sector with the highest number of billionaire investors in the Insider Monkey database in Q4 of 2024. When two or more companies had the same number of billionaires backing them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year. Following are theBest Oil Stocks According to Billionaires.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Billionaire Holders: 16\nTopping our list of theBest Oil Stocks According to Billionairesis Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), one of the largest integrated fuels, lubricants, and chemical companies in the world. The company operates facilities or markets products around the globe and explores for oil and natural gas on six continents.\nAfter the $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources last year, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\u2019s production in the Permian Basin and Guyana hit a record high in 2024. The oil major delivered an industry-leading financial performance last year, with $34 billion in earnings and $55 billion in cash flow from operations, its third-highest result in a decade despite softer market conditions. The company\u2019s total production came in at 4.3 million boed in 2024, with a target to achieve close to 5.4 million boed in 2030.\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has grown its earnings at an annual rate of roughly 30% over the last five years, while its cash flow has increased at a CAGR of about 15%. The company intends to continue this momentum and expects to add a further $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in cash flow by the end of the decade. Exxon remains committed to its shareholders, having grown its annual dividend for 42 consecutive years. The company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.99 per share for Q1 of 2025 and also revealed plans to repurchase $20 billion in shares annually through 2026.\nOverall, XOMranks 1ston our list of the best oil stocks to invest in according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM to grow , our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other best oil stocks.\nAfter an encouraging start to the year, the energy sector is once again lagging behind the overall market. At the time of writing this piece, the broader energy sector has slid by almost 8.2% since the beginning of 2025, against declines of around 7.9% by the wider market. The principal reason behind this fall is the decline in the global prices of oil, which have plunged by almost 14.5% since the beginning of the year.\nREAD NEXT:10 Best Clean Energy Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires\nThe continued uncertainty surrounding the ongoing tariff war and the recent decision by OPEC+ to increase supply in May have taken a toll on the global price, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price now hovering around a 3-year low of $61.5. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecasted WTI price to average $63.88 per barrel for 2025 before dropping to an average of $57.48 next year. Such a sharp decline in prices could threaten US oil production growth this year. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the US oil industry needs prices between $61 and $70 per barrel to be profitable.\nThe escalating trade tensions between the US and China have also raised the prospect of a global economic slowdown, potentially leading to a lower-than-forecasted consumption of oil. In its latest report, the EIA now expects global oil consumption to increase by 900,000 b/d in 2025 and 1 million b/d in 2026, down by 400,000 b/d and 100,000 b/d, respectively, from its initial forecast last month. The decrease in demand, coupled with increasing production, will continue putting pressure on crude prices, forcing many industry players to cut back activity to maintain investor payouts.\nThe American oil and gas sector is also frustrated by the back and forth trade policies of President Trump and is questioning how they align with his \u2018drill, baby, drill\u2019 mandate to further boost production. According to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, nearly a third of oil executives have stated that their business outlook has worsened since the end of 2024. Moreover, the imposition of the 25% tariff on steel and aluminum has already led to an estimated 4% increase in costs for drilling a well.\nThe pressing issues surrounding the global oil trade have forced the industry to shift focus to its second major source of revenue \u2013 natural gas. In contrast to oil, the benchmark US natural gas price at Henry Hub has surged by more than 123% since last year and by almost 18% since the beginning of 2025. The uptick comes as a result of slowing output in 2024, booming LNG exports, and fast-depleting inventories during the coldest winter in six years. Moreover, natural gas has emerged as a leading candidate to power the ongoing AI boom and its accompanying data centers, with many providers now even aiming to surpass utilities and supply directly to these power-hungry facilities.\nAlso, despite the broad concerns, many billionaires continue to invest and remain bullish on the oil sector. A great example is how Warren Buffett\u2019sBerkshire Hathawaymaintains significant holdings in multiple oil majors and even recently invested hundreds of millions of dollars in an oil and gas giant over the last few months.\nAn aerial view of an oil rig at sea, the sun glinting off its structure.\nTo collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of billionaires\u2019 stock holdings and picked the top 10 companies operating in the oil sector with the highest number of billionaire investors in the Insider Monkey database in Q4 of 2024. When two or more companies had the same number of billionaires backing them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year.

However, the company increased its revenue by 10.7% YoY to $52.23 billion during the quarter, topping estimates as it increased its worldwide and US production by 7% and 19%, respectively, to record levels in 2024. CVX also maintains a robust balance sheet and generated $31.5 billion in operating cash flow and $15 billion in free cash flow in FY 2024, ending the year with a net debt ratio of 10%. The industry giant expects to maintain this momentum, expecting to add $10 billion of annual free cash flow in 2026 (assuming $70 oil) and around $9 billion at the current Brent price.\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is known for its commitment to shareholders, and the company returned a record $27 billion to its shareholders in 2024 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The company has returned over $75 billion to shareholders over the last three years and recently increased its quarterly dividend by 4.9% to $1.71 per share, maintaining a 38-year streak of consistent dividend growth.\nAs a result, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) was also included in our list of the25 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires.\nOverall, CVXranks 4thon our list of the best oil stocks to invest in according to billionaires.

All necessary permits will be expedited and quickly delivered to NVIDIA, as they will to all companies committing to be part of the Golden Age of America!\u201d Trump said in a Truth Social post.\nNvidia's announcement brings Big Tech\u2019s investment pledges to US AI infrastructure to just north of $1.6 trillion since Trump's inauguration as thetech world tries to navigate the potential hazards of the president's trade war while staying on the right side of a malleable administration.\nNvidia, for its part, did seem to make moves in US manufacturing partially due to Trump\u2019s chaotic approach to trade policy, with on-again, off-again global tariffs affecting imports of AI servers containing its highly coveted GPUs, or graphics processing units.\nAsked about Trump\u2019s tariffs at its annual GTC event in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was \"preparing, and we have been preparing to manufacture onshore.\" Huangreportedly attended a dinner at Mar-a-Lagolast week, after which the Trump administration backed off new restrictions on the company's chip exports to China.\nNvidia's moves are the latest in Big Tech's splashy announcements of plans to expand investments within the US.\nIn February, Apple (AAPL)committed to investing $500 billion to expand its US manufacturingover the next four years.\nTSMC (TSM) \u2014 which makes the world's most advanced chips with most of its manufacturing capacity in Taiwan \u2014has committed to spending $100 billionover a similar time frame. The company had previously committed $65 billion to building out its US manufacturing capabilities with funding from the 2022 Chips and Science Act.\nJust after Trump's inauguration, Oracle (ORCL), OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), and SoftBank (SFTBY) announceda joint venture called Stargate, which the companies said would spend $500 billion on US AI data centers.\nAnd after Trump's election, Microsoft (MSFT) said it wouldspend $80 billion to build AI data centers. The company said \"more than half\" of that total would be invested in the US.\nApple's US-centric moves have landed in the spotlight again amid Trump's fluctuating tariff policies.

All necessary permits will be expedited and quickly delivered to NVIDIA, as they will to all companies committing to be part of the Golden Age of America!\u201d Trump said in a Truth Social post.\nNvidia's announcement brings Big Tech\u2019s investment pledges to US AI infrastructure to just north of $1.6 trillion since Trump's inauguration as thetech world tries to navigate the potential hazards of the president's trade war while staying on the right side of a malleable administration.\nNvidia, for its part, did seem to make moves in US manufacturing partially due to Trump\u2019s chaotic approach to trade policy, with on-again, off-again global tariffs affecting imports of AI servers containing its highly coveted GPUs, or graphics processing units.\nAsked about Trump\u2019s tariffs at its annual GTC event in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was \"preparing, and we have been preparing to manufacture onshore.\" Huangreportedly attended a dinner at Mar-a-Lagolast week, after which the Trump administration backed off new restrictions on the company's chip exports to China.\nNvidia's moves are the latest in Big Tech's splashy announcements of plans to expand investments within the US.\nIn February, Apple (AAPL)committed to investing $500 billion to expand its US manufacturingover the next four years.\nTSMC (TSM) \u2014 which makes the world's most advanced chips with most of its manufacturing capacity in Taiwan \u2014has committed to spending $100 billionover a similar time frame. The company had previously committed $65 billion to building out its US manufacturing capabilities with funding from the 2022 Chips and Science Act.\nJust after Trump's inauguration, Oracle (ORCL), OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), and SoftBank (SFTBY) announceda joint venture called Stargate, which the companies said would spend $500 billion on US AI data centers.\nAnd after Trump's election, Microsoft (MSFT) said it wouldspend $80 billion to build AI data centers. The company said \"more than half\" of that total would be invested in the US.\nApple's US-centric moves have landed in the spotlight again amid Trump's fluctuating tariff policies. Apple announced its $500 billion commitment just days afterTrump said CEO Tim Cookpromised him hundreds of millions of dollars in US investment and implied the pledge was due to his approach to trade policy.\n\"They don't want to be in the tariffs,\" Trump said in February.\nHowever,it\u2019s unclear how much of Apple\u2019s commitment will be from new investments, given that the spending announced was in line with its prior capital expenditures.\nNevertheless, Trump's relationship with Cook has weaved its way into tariff developments in the past several days. US Customs and Border Protectionissued regulations late Fridayexempting consumer electronics, networking equipment, and computing products \u2014 including GPUs and servers \u2014 from reciprocal tariffs.\nThat includes Trump's ever-ballooning 145% levies on China, where Apple still does most of its production. Trump boasted Monday that he \"helped Tim Cook recently.\"\n\"I don't want to hurt anybody, but the end result is we're going to get to the position of greatness for our country,\" he said.\nBut Trump also set the stage to impose tariffs on semiconductors Tuesday \u2014the Commerce Department opened a probe into computer chips under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which grants the president the authority to impose tariffs on imports seen as essential to national security. And he has promised that most electronics will still get wrapped up in his tariffs.\n\"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,\" he posted Sunday.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Creed appointed as the new CEO effective May 1, 2025. This leadership transition, along with adjustments to executive compensation, appears timely with the company's stock seeing a 6% rise last week. This move aligned closely with broader market trends where major indexes were buoyed by tech and bank stocks amid easing U.S.-China trade tensions. Within this context, Caterpillar's announcements likely added positive sentiment, supporting the stock's alignment with the market's upward trajectory, which saw a similar 7% climb over the same period.\nWe've identified 2 possible red flags with Caterpillar and understanding the impact should be part of your investment process.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 20 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nThe recent leadership change at Caterpillar, with Joseph E. Creed stepping in as CEO, might further solidify the company's strategic focus on sustainability and growth in alternative fuel markets. This aligns with Caterpillar's ongoing investments in capacity expansion and new technologies, potentially improving long-term revenue growth. While recent executive changes have buoyed short-term sentiment, impacting weekly stock performance positively, the firm's share price also reflects longstanding investor confidence with a total return of 186.72% over the last five years. This context frames a robust performance relative to the broader US market and offers a clear view of its trajectory beyond near-term fluctuations.\nAnalysis shows Caterpillar's shares are somewhat discounted compared to the consensus analyst price target of US$365.99, which indicates potential upward movement of over 20%. If the new leadership can successfully navigate near-term challenges such as lower sales volumes and an unfavorable product mix, revenue and earnings forecasts could improve in line with market expectations. A focus on high-margin services and strategic capital deployment could further enhance shareholder returns despite potential revenue pressures in certain sectors. As the company continues to pursue its sustainability goals, any advancements could further align with long-term market trends, potentially justifying current and future valuations.\nDive into the specifics of Caterpillar here with our thorough balance sheet health report.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.We provide commentary based on historical data and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your financial situation.

Combined, the three banks earned more than $12 billion in fees in their equities businesses, the desks that run stock-market related activities for clients."

These events occurred alongside solid earnings reports, with a significant rise in net income and earnings per share compared to the previous year. While the company's stock price increased by 6.64% over the last quarter, the broader market also trended upward, climbing 5.9% in the past year. These company developments likely complemented the overall market movements and investor sentiment, rather than diverging from broader trends.\nYou should learn about the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Johnson & Johnson.\nOutshine the giants: these 25 early-stage AI stocks could fund your retirement.\nJohnson & Johnson's recent dividend increase and positive Phase 3 clinical data for icotrokinra could significantly bolster investor confidence by enhancing perceptions of future earnings potential and revenue growth. The company's total return, including dividends, was 17.11% over the past five years, indicating steady but moderate financial performance. This is set against the backdrop of a one-year underperformance relative to the US Pharmaceuticals industry's 7% decline.\nLooking forward, these announcements could positively influence earnings forecasts, especially with expected boosts from TREMFYA and RYBREVANT within the Innovative Medicine segment. This aligns with strategic acquisitions and product launches that have been projected to grow revenue and expand market footprint. Despite these gains, competition and economic pressures remain considerations, particularly in international markets like China.\nCurrently trading at US$150, the share price reflects a modest discount to the analyst consensus price target of US$171.11. This implies potential upside and suggests market expectations are still reconciling with Johnson & Johnson's future growth prospects. Revenue and earnings forecasts will likely incorporate these developments, while still being mindful of existing risks such as biosimilar competition and macroeconomic pressures.\nReview our historical performance report to gain insights into Johnson & Johnson's track record.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.We provide commentary based on historical data and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your financial situation.

Additionally, its partnership with SandboxAQ and integration with HCLTech showcased the company's continuous innovation in AI applications. These latest initiatives may have supported NVIDIA\u2019s 13% price increase last week. The tech sector's broader rally, amidst market gains propelled by semiconductor tariff relief, also contributed to the company's performance.

These initiatives may contribute to enhanced long-term revenue prospects by attracting a broader user base for AI applications and gaming solutions, aligning with expectations of significant future revenue streams from these areas. Analysts' current forecasts expect NVIDIA's revenue to climb by 20.4% annually, with earnings growing at 20.6% per year over the next three years.\nOver the last five years, NVIDIA's total shareholder return, which includes both share price appreciation and dividends, was very large, at 1448.41%. This performance far surpasses the US Market's 6.1% return over the past year and highlights NVIDIA's capacity to outperform its industry peers, particularly within the semiconductor sector.\nThe recent developments, such as the introduction of the RTX 5060 series, might bolster NVIDIA's revenue and earnings forecasts by expanding its gaming segment foothold. Analysts anticipate NVIDIA's earnings to reach $159.1 billion by April 2028, but they are divided on this, with estimates ranging from $132.1 billion to $237.5 billion. With the current share price reflecting a 51.5% potential upside according to analysts' consensus, NVIDIA's stock might align closer to its price target of US$169.47, contingent upon continued strong performance and innovation.\nClick to explore a detailed breakdown of our findings in NVIDIA's financial health report.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.We provide commentary based on historical data and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your financial situation.

WhileApple(AAPL-0.23%)has geographically diversified its supply chain, the company still relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing partners for its devices. Absent any special treatment, prices in the U.S. on Apple products would have likely risen substantially due to the tariffs.\nWhile Apple is getting a big break, the relief may be short lived. President Trump later clarified that electronics like Apple's iPhones would be moving into a different tariff \"bucket.\" While Apple's devices may not be subject to the full tariff on Chinese imports, they may eventually be subject to some level of tariffs.\nEven if Apple somehow manages to avoid tariffs on its own products, the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, along with the uncertainty created by the Trump administration's generaltariff policy, could hurt the company in another way.\nWhile predicting anything about the economy right now is tough, the odds of an economic downturn certainly appear to be rising as businesses and consumers cope with the impact of unpredictable and ever-changing tariffs. Consumer confidence plunged in March, according to The Conference Board, and consumers' short-term expectations regarding economic conditions reached their lowest level in 12 years. These drops were recorded before the Trump administration announced its reciprocal tariffs, which led to a sharp stock market plunge.\nSmartphones are an essential item for nearly everyone, but purchases can also be easily deferred. The replacement cycles for smartphones and other electronic devices have been lengthening already, and this effect could go into overdrive during a recession. If smartphones also become more expensive due to tariffs, the replacement cycle could lengthen further.\nApple Intelligence, Apple's take onAI-powered featuresfor its devices, probably won't save the day and induce many iPhone users to upgrade. Apple is reportedly having all sorts of problems with a revamped version of Siri, which raises questions about when the promised AI features will arrive and how useful they will be.\nNew hardware probably won't help, either. The smartphone market is mature, and annual upgrades don't introduce much more than slightly better performance or other modest improvements. Without a good reason to upgrade, it won't be much of a sacrifice for consumers to kick the can down the road during a recession.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor\u2019stotal average return is800%\u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now\u2026\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nDespite iPhone sales flatlining and the tariff uncertainty, Apple stock trades for around 28 times the average analyst estimate for fiscal 2025. Analysts are still assuming, by the way, that Apple will manage to grow earnings significantly this year. That forecast could turn out to be overly optimistic depending on how the tariff situation plays out.\nI'm not convinced Apple stock deserves that kind of valuation, given all the headwinds facing the company. The iPhone business was already struggling to grow, and an economic slowdown isn't going to help matters. Even if Apple manages to stay out of the tariff crosshairs, sales and profits look likely to take a hit this year.

    "content": "URL: https://www.verdict.co.uk/trump-tariffs-apple-takes-hit/?.tsrc=rss\nContent:\nWhatever the implementation timeline, US tariffs will significantly impact consumer electronics OEMs and telcos. Apple stands out as being particularly vulnerable, with growing pressure to shift its production to the US. But how feasible is all that?\nOn April 11, 2025, just days after announcing new tariffs, the Trump administration exempted smartphones, laptops, processors, displays, and memory chips from tariffs, only to later clarify that this was a temporary reprieve.\nThe US government is set to reassess the entire consumer electronics supply chain amid an investigation into semiconductors, which may soon face tariffs. Earlier last week, the president also announced a 90-day suspension of \u2018reciprocal\u2019 tariffs for most trading partners. Concurrently, Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to an unprecedented 145%. This indicates a strong push for US production of consumer devices, including Apple iPhones. The pressing question is whether Apple can manufacture its products domestically.\nManufacturing Apple devices in the US is possible but would require significant investment and effort from Apple and governmental bodies, both present and future, with years of business disruption in between.\nA new GlobalData survey seeks to throw light on the attitudes of global investors towards Mauritius\nChina has developed a robust consumer electronics ecosystem over decades, with a vast network of suppliers, skilled labor, efficient infrastructure, and ample production sites. Consequently, more than half of Apple\u2019s 200 global suppliers are based in China, where a skilled workforce and favourable conditions for large-scale manufacturing exist.\nReplicating this in the US would necessitate attracting skilled labour, reforming educational pathways, and fostering a culture that values higher education\u2014actions that are not currently aligned with the administration\u2019s policies, as evidenced by the recent immigration uproar and the gutting of the US Department of Education. These tariffs, therefore, appear to be geopolitical trade instruments plainly intended to secure more advantageous agreements.\nIf Apple cannot secure long-term tariff exemptions, then the cost of its devices will likely rise.\nCurrently, 80% of Apple\u2019s overall products are assembled in China, and a 145% tariff could increase the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max to more than $2,600. Apple has begun diversifying production to India and Vietnam, moving about 15-20% of its production there, but remains heavily reliant on China, where 90% of iPhones are still assembled.\nIn the meantime, Apple is stockpiling millions of iPhones, with reports of five planeloads of phones and accessories flying into the US from India in the three days following the April 2 tariff communication. However, the upcoming iPhone 17 series, produced in China, may face tariffs, complicating pricing strategies and potentially dampening consumer demand.\nApple faces a potential crisis. Should the company be compelled to shift production to the US, it will encounter insurmountable challenges in meeting its current scale of shipments. The company is at risk of a supply-demand imbalance if forced to shift production to the US, which could lead to higher prices and lost sales.\nApple\u2019s challenges are compounded in China, its third largest market, by growing negative American sentiment and competition from local Chinese manufacturers like Huawei and Vivo, which are gaining market share due to their technological advancements, as well as their progressiveness in AI. Additionally, rival Samsung\u2019s diversified supply chain \u2013 spread across Vietnam, India, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Korea \u2013 gives it a competitive edge, as the company is less over exposed to China compared with Apple.\nSuffice it to say that Apple has not faced a crisis of this magnitude since its potential bankruptcy in 1997.\nThe gold standard of business intelligence.\nFind out more\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\nThematic Take (monthly)\nI consent to Verdict Media Limited collecting my details provided via this form in accordance withPrivacy Policy\nView all newslettersfrom across the GlobalData Media network.\nDecrypting the latest technology news\nPowered by\n\u00a9 Verdict Media Limited 2025\nThese cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.

Despite the continued buzz around the technology, no one seems interested in buying the falling stocks.

The cost of AI infrastructure has increased drastically, especially for companies relying on imported components.\nREAD ALSO:14 AI Stocks Catching Wall Street\u2019s Attentionand9 Trending AI Stocks Making Headlines Today.\nThe narrative around AI stocks has also begun to change because investors are critiquing that prices have become too expensive, and because there is intensifying competition from Chinese companies developing their own AI offerings.\nIn the latest news, seven Republican U.S. senators have also sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The letter urges him to get rid of a Biden administration rule that restricts global access to AI chips before it kicks in next month. The letter claims that the AI diffusion rule will deter U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, which is why it demands an \u201cimmediate action\u201d to halt it. The rule is set to take effect on May 15.\n\u201cEvery day this rule remains in place, American companies face mounting uncertainty, stalled investments, and the risk of losing critical global partnerships that cannot be easily regained. We urge you to withdraw this rule and propose an alternative that is effective in preventing Communist China from capturing the world market in leading technology without compromising American advantages.\u201d\nIt also noted how the rule puts countries into three tiers, with only 18 nations in the Tier 1 group with the easiest access to American technology. Those in tier 2 have to face \u201carbitrary purchase limits and a cumbersome licensing process.\u201d Meanwhile, it asserted that Tier 3 countries are already \u201crightly restricted.\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AMD) develops and sells semiconductors, processors, and GPUs for data centers, gaming, AI, and embedded applications. On April 8, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh downgraded the stock to \u201cSector Weight\u201d from Overweight without a price target amid escalating tariff risks and price competition. With export restrictions likely to limit demand for AMD\u2019s chips from Chinese hyperscalers, the firm believes AMD could face greater competition from Nvidia and a slowdown in the China business.\n\u201cChina AI demand may not be sustainable and may be at risk, while NVDA is so far ahead with GB200/NVL. We estimate 2025 MI308 GPUs volumes at 300K and reflect the majority of the growth for AMD. Excluding China, there is very little to no growth in AI GPUs this year.\u201d\nVinh further talked about the limited opportunity to gain additional shares in the PC and server market when compared to Intel.\n\u201cWe believe AMD will be forced to react to INTC\u2019s aggressive price actions in the range of 20-40% on Lunar Lake in order to maintain/regain lost market share to INTC. While the stock is relatively inexpensive, trading at 13x our 2026 EPS estimate, semiconductor stocks rarely work with risk to GMs, which we are increasingly concerned about given the aggressive price cuts by INTC.\u201d\nOverall, AMDranks 9thon our list of AI stocks to watch amid market volatility. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Despite the continued buzz around the technology, no one seems interested in buying the falling stocks. Fluctuating tariff policies from the Trump administration have concerned Wall Street and disrupted global supply chains.

The letter urges him to get rid of a Biden administration rule that restricts global access to AI chips before it kicks in next month. The letter claims that the AI diffusion rule will deter U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, which is why it demands an \u201cimmediate action\u201d to halt it. The rule is set to take effect on May 15.\n\u201cEvery day this rule remains in place, American companies face mounting uncertainty, stalled investments, and the risk of losing critical global partnerships that cannot be easily regained.

While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

For shareholders, the last few months have been challenging with concerns over the strength of the global economy rattling the broader stock market. At the time of writing on April 11, shares of Alphabet are down 24% from that record high.\nDespite this turbulence, what hasn't changed is the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Innovations in areas like machine learning, automation, andgenerative AIare rapidly transforming the global economy. Alphabet is at the forefront of this wave, poised to capitalize on significant long-term growth opportunities.\nHere are four reasons I believe Alphabet is the best AI stock to buy right now.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nAlphabet's AI strategy stands out, integrating machine learning, generative AI, and automation across its ecosystem. The company's diverse user base in market-leading platforms such as Google Search, YouTube, Android, and Chrome is an edge within the tech sector, leveraging vast amounts of unique user data to support its cutting-edge AI models.\nThis AI prowess is evident in Google Cloud, which has been a major growth driver capturing exceptional demand. That includes the unique Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) -- a custom chip designed by Google to power its specific AI workloads. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai commented on the company's unique positioning and the benefits of its vertically integrated AI strategy. In the fourth-quarter earnings conference call, Pichai said: \"We have a unique advantage because we develop every component of our technology stack, including hardware, compilers, models and products. This approach allows us to drive efficiencies at every level, from training and serving, to developer productivity.\"\nSeveral growth tailwinds support Alphabet's long-term outlook and AI leadership consolidation, including:\nThe best part is the sense that Alphabet is just getting started.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor\u2019stotal average return is800%\u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now\u2026\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nI appreciate Alphabet's high-quality fundamentals, scale, and diversification, which are crucial amid the uncertainty surrounding trade tariffs under the Trump administration.\nUnlike its tech peers, such as Amazon andApple, Alphabet's core digital advertising business, which accounted for 78% of its revenue last year, is largely shielded from tariffs on imported goods. With over half of its business outside the U.S., Alphabet appears resilient, with indications suggesting it's business as usual into the second quarter.\nAfter a record-breaking 2024 with 14% revenue growth and earnings per share (EPS) of $8.04, Alphabet is expected to continue delivering stellar earnings growth and strong free cash flow. Wall Street analysts project further upside, including double-digit revenue growth in 2025 and an EPS estimate of $8.90, representing an 11% year-over-year increase. Recent cost-saving measures, such as reported headcount reductions, could support profitability margins to exceed earnings forecasts.\nWith a solid balance sheet and $96 billion in cash, Alphabet is well-equipped to navigate any macroeconomic environment.\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. YOY = year over year.\nAlphabet stands out as a top AI stock because of its bargain valuation. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17, Alphabet trades at a discount to its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, including AI titans Apple, Amazon,Meta Platforms, Microsoft, andNvidia, which average around 26. Given Alphabet's double-digit earnings growth, there's a case to be made that shares are undervalued.\nGOOGL PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts\nI'm bullish on Alphabet, viewing the recent stock price weakness asa buy-the-dip opportunity.\nWhile risks persist, including regulatory scrutiny and a delicate macroeconomic environment, the company's AI leadership positions it to emerge stronger. As long as Alphabet continues delivering profitable growth, it may just be a matter of time before the stock makes a new all-time high.\nBefore you buy stock inAlphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 andAlphabetwasn\u2019t one of them.

The cost of AI infrastructure has increased drastically, especially for companies relying on imported components.\nREAD ALSO:14 AI Stocks Catching Wall Street\u2019s Attentionand9 Trending AI Stocks Making Headlines Today.\nThe narrative around AI stocks has also begun to change because investors are critiquing that prices have become too expensive, and because there is intensifying competition from Chinese companies developing their own AI offerings.\nIn the latest news, seven Republican U.S. senators have also sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The letter urges him to get rid of a Biden administration rule that restricts global access to AI chips before it kicks in next month. The letter claims that the AI diffusion rule will deter U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, which is why it demands an \u201cimmediate action\u201d to halt it. The rule is set to take effect on May 15.\n\u201cEvery day this rule remains in place, American companies face mounting uncertainty, stalled investments, and the risk of losing critical global partnerships that cannot be easily regained. We urge you to withdraw this rule and propose an alternative that is effective in preventing Communist China from capturing the world market in leading technology without compromising American advantages.\u201d\nIt also noted how the rule puts countries into three tiers, with only 18 nations in the Tier 1 group with the easiest access to American technology.

This article is originally published atInsider Monkey.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) stock reached an all-time high price of $207.05 on Feb. 4, riding a wave of strong growth and earnings momentum from 2024.  At the time of writing on April 11, shares of Alphabet are down 24% from that record high.  Innovations in areas like machine learning, automation, and generative AI are rapidly transforming the global economy.\nThe U.S. stock market has been extremely volatile since President Donald Trump rolled out hefty tariffs on goods from virtually every country this month, and that wild ride has continued in the wake of his move Wednesday to temporarily hold those new import taxes at 10% for all countries except China, for which he increased them to 145%.  While no investment is a sure thing, here are three reasons why buying Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) stock now could look like a great decision in years to come.  While other companies with exposure to the artificial intelligence (AI) trend might get more attention, Alphabet has a strong position in AI through its cloud infrastructure services and its Gemini chatbot.\nGoogle is bringing its Veo 2 video-generating AI model to users who pay for Gemini Advanced, the company's premium AI plan.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nThere's no shortage of discounts on the stock market these days.\nStocks were already slumping in March on weakening consumer sentiment and fears of an economic slowdown, but major indexes plummeted in April on President Donald Trump's tariff plan, which has sent a near-unprecedented wave of uncertainty washing over the market. In the aftermath, a trade war with China has escalated, and while Trump's 90-day pause garnered cheers from the market, there is still plenty of uncertainty for business owners and investors.\nSeasoned investors know that sell-offs like this one can be nerve-wracking but they also created buying opportunities. On that note, let's take a look two tech stocks that look like great buys after falling substantially.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nShares ofThe Trade Desk(TTD1.29%), the leading independent demand side platform (DSP) in the ad tech industry are down 64% from their all-time high as I write this and have plunged since February for two reasons.\nFirst, The Trade Desk tumbled after it delivered a weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings report in February, missing its own revenue guidance for the first time in its history as a publicly traded company. Following that one-day collapse, the stock has continued to slide on concerns about an economic slowdown caused by tariffs.\nAs a service-based business, The Trade Desk isn't directly exposed to tariffs, but advertising businesses are typically sensitive to the overall health of the economy, which explains the ongoing sell-off in the stock since the earnings report.\nHowever, The Trade Desk acquitted itself well during the last advertising scare in 2022. When sales growth flattened at digital advertising giants likeAlphabetandMeta Platformsas well as its ad tech peers, The Trade Desk continued to deliver revenue growth of 20% or more.\nThe Trade Desk stock is now about as cheap as it's been at anytime in the last five years even though the company has grown significantly since it last traded at its current price around $50 a share. The stock now looks downright cheap, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 30 based on adjusted earnings. That likely reflects investor expectations that earnings could fall from here if an economic downturn takes hold, but investors should remember the company's resilience in 2022.\nIf CEO Jeff Green is right that the fourth-quarter miss was due to a few internal errors, rather than lasting challenges, the stock should be an easy long-term winner from here.\nThere are no points for originality in investing, which is why buying high-quality stocks works.\nNvidia(NVDA1.42%)needs little introduction at this point as the chipmaker has led the AI revolution and seems set to remain in that position. However, the stock has fallen 26% from its peak on concerns about economic headwinds, which present a risk to its blistering revenue growth.\nHowever, Nvidia's business seems relatively protected from the tariffs. First, \"bare die\" semiconductors --\u00a0 or individual chips that aren't in something else -- are currently excluded from tariffs, and given the push for domestic chip manufacturing, Nvidia is likely to be seen favorably by the federal government.\nAdditionally, demand for its products and AI more generally are likely to continue to grow as economic headwinds don't change the spoils of winning the race toartificial general intelligence(AGI). Also, just two days before Trump's tariff announcement, OpenAI raised $40 billion at a $300 billion valuation, showing that there continues to be substantial investor interest in AI.\nNvidia stock now trades at aforward P/Eunder 25, giving the stock a margin of safety even if growth isn't as fact as investors hope. Even if growth does slow down, the company looks well positioned to continue to lead the AI revolution, which still has a lot more to run.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a\u201cDouble Down\u201d stockrecommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks to watch amid market volatility.\nThe uncertain macroeconomic environment is diminishing investors\u2019 readiness to pay high prices for stocks related to artificial intelligence. Despite the continued buzz around the technology, no one seems interested in buying the falling stocks. Fluctuating tariff policies from the Trump administration have concerned Wall Street and disrupted global supply chains. The cost of AI infrastructure has increased drastically, especially for companies relying on imported components.\nREAD ALSO:14 AI Stocks Catching Wall Street\u2019s Attentionand9 Trending AI Stocks Making Headlines Today.\nThe narrative around AI stocks has also begun to change because investors are critiquing that prices have become too expensive, and because there is intensifying competition from Chinese companies developing their own AI offerings.\nIn the latest news, seven Republican U.S. senators have also sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The letter urges him to get rid of a Biden administration rule that restricts global access to AI chips before it kicks in next month. The letter claims that the AI diffusion rule will deter U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, which is why it demands an \u201cimmediate action\u201d to halt it. The rule is set to take effect on May 15.\n\u201cEvery day this rule remains in place, American companies face mounting uncertainty, stalled investments, and the risk of losing critical global partnerships that cannot be easily regained. We urge you to withdraw this rule and propose an alternative that is effective in preventing Communist China from capturing the world market in leading technology without compromising American advantages.\u201d\nIt also noted how the rule puts countries into three tiers, with only 18 nations in the Tier 1 group with the easiest access to American technology. Those in tier 2 have to face \u201carbitrary purchase limits and a cumbersome licensing process.\u201d Meanwhile, it asserted that Tier 3 countries are already \u201crightly restricted.\u201d\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points \u00a0(see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 166\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. On April 14, JPMorgan lowered the firm\u2019s price target on the stock to $245 from $270 and kept an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on the shares. The firm expressed its relief after Trump recently announced that the reciprocal tariffs will exempt smartphones and PCs. The analyst told investors in a research note how these exemptions will help investors refocus on the company\u2019s medium-term drivers. Regardless, \u201cseveral concerns\u201d remain from the developments over the last two weeks that will inhibit these very investors from turning to a bull case for Apple stock. The firm further announced that semiconductor tariffs are yet to be announced and could impact Apple.\nOverall, AAPLranks 5thon our list of AI stocks to watch amid market volatility. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

The uncertain macroeconomic environment is diminishing investors\u2019 readiness to pay high prices for stocks [\u2026]\nTo the relief of anyone with an aging iPhone, the Trump administration exempted smartphones, computers, and other tech products from its punishing tariffs on Chinese imports over the weekend.  While Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has geographically diversified its supply chain, the company still relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing partners for its devices.  Absent any special treatment, prices in the U.S. on Apple products would have likely risen substantially due to the tariffs.\nThe stock of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has fallen off in recent months because of tariff-related economic uncertainty.  The overriding concern with Alphabet is that generative AI could eat into its main cash cow, Google Search.  Meanwhile, Alphabet has several other high-growth businesses under its corporate umbrella, including YouTube, the leading streaming service in the world, and Google Cloud, which saw accelerating growth last year.\n(Bloomberg) -- While US President Donald Trump has announced a 90-day pause on his proposed tariff hikes, exporters are still dealing with the uncertainty of a 10% universal levy returning if trade deals aren\u2019t struck as his administration envisages.Most Read from BloombergThe Secret Formula for Faster TrainsNYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing SixEven Oslo Has an Air Quality ProblemHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?Lisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City\u2019s Hou\nThe Dow Jones rose on the stock market today and auto stocks popped after President Donald Trump spoke out.

The broader RTX 5060 family, including laptops, is scheduled to roll out in May across major OEMs in a range of designs as thin as 14.9mm.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nThe Blackwell RTX architecture features updated hardware built to accelerate neural rendering, ray tracing, and AI workloads. DLSS 4's transformer-based AI model enables up to three additional frames per rendered frame, which Nvidia said can significantly improve performance and image quality in supported titles.\nDLSS, short for Deep Learning Super Sampling, is a neural rendering technique that enhances frame rates and reduces latency by using AI-trained models. The technology is already integrated into more than 100 games and applications, with new ones being added weekly.\nThe release underscores Nvidia's push to deepen its foothold in AI-assisted gaming performance.\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus.\nStocks were already slumping in March on weakening consumer sentiment and fears of an economic slowdown, but major indexes plummeted in April on President Donald Trump's tariff plan, which has sent a near-unprecedented wave of uncertainty washing over the market.  In the aftermath, a trade war with China has escalated, and while Trump's 90-day pause garnered cheers from the market, there is still plenty of uncertainty for business owners and investors.  On that note, let's take a look two tech stocks that look like great buys after falling substantially.\nThe Trump administration launched a trade probe into semiconductors that could lead to tariffs and broaden an already sweeping trade war.

Two weeks ago, one of the more formidable synthetic media companies, Runway, released thefourth generation of its video generatorandraised more than $300 millionin new capital.\nStarting Tuesday, Gemini Advanced subscribers will be able to select Veo\u00a02\u00a0from the model drop-down menu in Google\u2019sGeminiapps. Users can create eight-second video clips at 720p resolution with a 16:9 aspect ratio, and upload these clips to TikTok, YouTube, and more via Gemini\u2019s \u201cshare\u201d button. Veo 2-generated videos can also be downloaded as MP4 files, watermarked with Google\u2019s SynthID tech.\nThere\u2019s a limit to how many videos users can create each month, and the Google Workspace business and education plans aren\u2019t supported at the moment, the company says.\nGoogle is also integrating Veo 2 with Whisk, an experimental feature in Google Labs that lets you use images as prompts with Gemini to create new images. A new feature, Whisk Animate, lets users take images they\u2019ve generated and turn them into eight-second, Veo 2-generated videos. (Google Labs is Google\u2019s platform for early-stage AI products, gated behind the company\u2019s $20-per-month Google One AI Premium subscription.)\nGoogle\u2019s applications of Veo 2 may seem fairly basic at the moment. But the CEO of Google DeepMind, Demis Hassabis,recently saidthat the company plans to eventually combine itsGeminiAI models withVeotoimprove the former\u2019s understanding of the physical world.\nIn the meantime, many artists and creators are wary of video generators like Veo 2, which threaten to upend entire creative industries.

Administrators managing multi-user accounts must enable the integration on their end before users can connect their Google Workspace and Claude accounts, according to Anthropic.\nGoogle DeepMind\u2019sGemini chatbot also integrates with Workspace, and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT integrates with Google Drive. However, Anthropic is one of the first third-party AI companies to offer a way to closely connect to Google\u2019s productivity suite.\nAnthropic\u2019s team-up with Google aims to give Claude more personally tailored responses without requiring users to repeatedly upload files or craft detailed prompts. OpenAI and Google have tried achieving the same effect via different approaches, such as addingmemory featuresthat allow chatbots to reference past conversations in their replies.\nIn a press release, Anthropic says Claude\u2019s new integration can help users organize their professional and personal lives. For example, Anthropic claims the feature can assist parents by scanning \u201cemails and calendar events to highlight important commitments, while searching the web for updated school calendars, local community events, and weather forecasts that might affect family plans.\u201d\nClaude will provide in-line citations when it references Workspace content, showing users exactly where specific information originated, says Anthropic.\nWhile the integration doesn\u2019t give Claude the ability to schedule calendar events or send emails, it may raise security concerns among some users. It\u2019s unclear how extensively Claude will search through a person\u2019s Google Workspace, or whether users have to direct Claude to look at a particular email or calendar event depending on the nature of their request. It\u2019s also not clear whether users can ask Claude not to search across certain sensitive emails or files.\nResponding to the above, an Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company doesn\u2019t train models on user data by default and has implemented \u201cstrict authentication and access control mechanisms\u201d for external services like Workspace.\n\u201cEach user or organization\u2019s connections to external services (like Google Drive, Gmail, etc.) are properly authenticated and authorized for only that specific user or organization,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cClaude doesn\u2019t have the ability to access or transfer data between different users\u2019 connected services, as each connection is bound to the specific authentication credentials of that individual user or organization.\u201d\nAnthropic also announced on Tuesday the launch of Claude Research, a new feature that conducts multiple web searches to generate detailed answers. Positioned as a competitor to OpenAI and Google\u2019s \u201cdeep research\u201d agents, Claude Research offers an \u201coptimal tradeoff\u201d between speed and comprehensiveness, Anthropic says.\nClaude Research typically runs for less than a minute to compile info, according to an Anthropic spokesperson \u2014 faster than some rival deep research agents. However, Claude Research doesn\u2019t use a custom model, instead leveraging Claude\u2019s recently launched web search capabilities.\nThe company is rolling out Claude Research to subscribers to its Max, Team, and Enterprise plans in the United States, Japan, and Brazil. It\u2019ll come to Pro customers soon, Anthropic says.\nThese updates are part of Anthropic\u2019s broader effort to attract users to its AI subscription plans with features that make Claude more capable and useful.

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nExxon Mobil CorporationXOM, the U.S. oil and gas giant, has failed to find commercially feasible natural gas reserves at an exploratory well, namely\u00a0Elektra-1, which was drilled offshore Cyprus earlier this year. Earlier, XOM had mentioned that it collected extensive three-dimensional (3D) seismic data and discovered several large prospects offshore Cyprus, including the Electra prospect. Based on the evaluation of the seismic data, the company stated that the Electra prospect was promising.\nThe U.S. energy major recently completed drilling activities at the Elektra-1 well. The Ministry of Energy, Commerce and Industry in Cyprus noted that preliminary assessments and the data collected from the exploratory well indicated that the gas reserves at the prospect were commercially infeasible for development. However, the ministry also noted that XOM\u2019s initial assessments, following the drilling operations, have shown promising results. The initial results of the evaluation confirm the presence of a hydrocarbon system alongside high-quality reservoirs.\nThe drilling operations at the Electra prospect were conducted by a consortium comprising ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Cyprus, and QatarEnergy International E&P LLC, with the former acting as the operator. The Elektra-1 well was drilled in Block 5 of the Exclusive Economic Zone (\u201cEEZ\u201d) in Cyprus. ExxonMobil holds exploration licenses in two offshore blocks in Cyprus, with QatarEnergy as its partner.\nThe country's energy ministry has stated that the information collected while conducting drilling operations will be analyzed further and considered by the consortium before determining its future plans in Block 5. The consortium will now focus on drilling another exploratory well, Pegasus-1, located in a different offshore block in Cyrus\u2019 EEZ.\nThe results pose a major setback for Cyprus as the country is yet to produce natural gas from its offshore discoveries.

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nPfizerPFE announced that it is discontinuing the development of danuglipron, its investigational oral GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), which is being developed to treat obesity.\nThe decision follows a safety signal observed during two dose-optimization studies, in which one study participant experienced a case of potential drug-induced liver injury. Although the individual was asymptomatic and fully recovered after stopping the treatment, Pfizer stated that its decision was based on a comprehensive review of all clinical data generated to date, along with recent regulatory feedback.\nWhile the two dose-optimization studies had met key pharmacokinetic goals and identified a dose with the potential for competitive efficacy and tolerability, the safety concerns ultimately led Pfizer to stop further development of danuglipron.\nThis is the second time that Pfizer has faced setbacks in connection with the pipeline development of danuglipron. In December 2023, the company announced that it would not move forward with phase III studies on the twice-daily formulation of danuglipron. Though the drug was effective in reducing weight in a phase IIb study, it caused several gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Back then, the company said that the pharmacokinetic study of the once-daily formulation of danuglipron continues, and it will focus on its development.\nThis also marks the second time in two years that Pfizer has given up on an obesity drug. Back in 2023, Pfizer had dropped the development of another GLP-1-RA candidate, lotiglipron, due to elevated levels of a type of liver enzymes seen in a study.\nFollowing these setbacks, Pfizer has decided to focus on developing its other obesity candidates, which are either in early-stage or mid-stage development. One such candidate is PF-07976016, an investigational GIP receptor being evaluated in a mid-stage study for obesity.\nYear to date, shares of Pfizer have lost nearly 17% compared with the industry\u2019s 7% decline.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPost Pfizer\u2019s announcement, shares ofEli LillyLLY andNovo NordiskNVO rose 3% and 2%, respectively, on Monday. Both companies dominate the diabetes and obesity market on the back of the tremendous success of their GLP-1 products. Lilly markets its dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, tirzepatide, as Mounjaro for type II diabetes and as Zepbound for obesity. Novo markets its semaglutide drugs as Ozempic pre-filled pen and Rybelsus oral tablet for type II diabetes and as Wegovy injection for weight management.\nThe obesity market has garnered much interest lately. Per a research conducted by Goldman Sachs, the obesity market in the United States is expected to reach $100 billion by 2030. This is also evident from the fact that LLY and NVO have not only optimized their production capacities but are also developing multiple other novel obesity candidates at a rapid pace.\nThe implication of Pfizer\u2019s setback is clear for both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk \u2014 the immediate removal of a potential rival from the highly lucrative GLP-1 market. The latest setback puts Pfizer back at least a couple of years from entering the obesity space.\nA company that benefited from Pfizer\u2019s announcement wasViking TherapeuticsVKTX, which jumped nearly 11% on Monday. VKTX is currently developing its obesity drug candidate VK2735 in both oral and subcutaneous (SC) formulations. Viking Therapeutics is one of the few companies in this space that has made rapid and encouraging progress with its obesity drug.\nLast month, Viking announced that it has completed enrollment in a mid-stage study evaluating oral VK2735, just a couple of months after the study initiation was announced in January. This swift enrollment underscores the growing interest in VK2735 and reflects the rising momentum in the weight-loss drug market, led by the success of Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Novo\u2019s Wegovy. A late-stage study on the SC version is expected to start before the end of this quarter.\nPfizer Inc. price | Pfizer Inc. Quote\nPfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The FDIC declined to comment when reached Tuesday.\nBack in 2017, the FDIC accused Bank of America of refusing to pay over $500 million in assessments \u2014 a figure it later expanded to $1.12 billion \u2014 alleging that the banking giant failed to honor a 2011 regulatory rule and \u201cunjustly enriched itself\u201d at the FDIC\u2019s expense.\nThe Bank of America later filed a motion to dismiss in part, strongly denying it acted with an intent to evade such payments. It also argued that some of quarters the FDIC targeted for assessments fell outside the statue of limitations.\nAfter a yearslong legal battle, U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan in Washington, D.C. partially granted and denied motions for both Bank of America and the FDIC. She said that the nearly $540.3 million payment from Bank of America would cover its underpaid assessments spanning from the second quarter of 2013 through the end of 2014's fiscal year, plus interest \u2014 but ruled that the FDIC waited too long to sue over earlier claims.\nFormed in 1933 during the Great Depression, the FDIC is one of several banking system regulators today.

Sales and trading revenues (excluding net DVA) grew 9% to $5.65 billion, representing the highest number in a decade. Fixed-income trading fees increased 4.7%, while equity trading income jumped 16.7%. We had projected sales and trading revenues (excluding net DVA) of $4.85 billion.This, along with higher net interest income (NII), was the major revenue growth driver for Bank of America. NII grew on a year-over-year basis, driven by relatively lower deposit costs and fixed-rate asset repricing. Management projects NII to grow sequentially to almost $15.5-$15.7 billion by the fourth quarter end.On the other hand, total investment banking (IB) performance was subdued. The IB fees (in the Global Banking division) of $847 million were relatively stable as the plunge in equity underwriting income was almost offset by the improvement in advisory revenues and higher debt underwriting income.Further, provisions and non-interest expenses increased during the quarter.The company\u2019s net income applicable to common shareholders grew 13.8% from the prior-year quarter to $7 billion.

    "content": "URL: https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/us-antitrust-trial-metas-zuckerberg-161456145.html?.tsrc=rss\nContent:\nBy Jody Godoy and Katie Paul\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg considered spinning off popular photo-sharing app Instagram in 2018 in anticipation of possible antitrust scrutiny, according to a document shown at a trial in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday.\nThe document was shown during Zuckerberg's second day of testimony at the high-stakes trial, in which the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is seeking to unwind Meta's acquisitions of prized assets Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\"I wonder if we should consider the extreme step of spinning Instagram out as a separate company,\" Zuckerberg said in a memo discussing potential strategies for how to reorganize the social media company's family of apps.\n\"As calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps Whatsapp in the next 5-10 years anyway,\" he wrote.\nThe case, filed during President Donald Trump's first term, is widely seen as a test of the new Trump administration's promises to take on Big Tech companies.\n\"INSTAGRAM WAS BETTER\"\nZuckerberg testified earlier in the day that Meta bought Instagram because it had a \"better\" camera than the one his company was trying to build under its flagship Facebook brand at the time.\nThe acknowledgement appeared to bolster allegations by U.S. antitrust enforcers that Meta had used a \"buy or bury\" strategy to snap up potential rivals, keep smaller competitors at bay and maintain an illegal monopoly.\nAsked by an attorney for the FTC whether he thought fast-growing Instagram could be destructive to Meta, then known as Facebook, Zuckerberg said he believed Instagram had a better camera than what his company was building.\n\"We were doing a build vs. buy analysis\" while in the process of building a camera app, Zuckerberg said. \"I thought that Instagram was better at that, so I thought it was better to buy them.\"\nThe company argues that his past intentions are irrelevant because the FTC has defined the social media market inaccurately and failed to account for stiff competition Meta has faced from ByteDance's TikTok, Alphabet's YouTube and Apple's messaging app.\n\"BUILDING A NEW APP IS HARD\"\nZuckerberg also acknowledged that many of the company's attempts at building its own apps had failed.\n\"Building a new app is hard and many more times than not when we have tried to build a new app it hasn't gotten a lot of traction,\" Zuckerberg told the court.\n\"We probably tried building dozens of apps over the history of the company and the majority of them don't go anywhere,\" he said.\nZuckerberg's testimony comes as Meta is defending itself years after the release of damning statements plucked from Facebook's own documents, like a 2008 email in which he said \"it is better to buy than compete.\"\nThe FTC accuses Meta of holding a monopoly on platforms used to share content with friends and family, where its main competitors in the United States are Snap's Snapchat and MeWe, a tiny privacy-focused social media app launched in 2016.\nPlatforms where users broadcast content to strangers based on shared interests, such as X, TikTok, YouTube and Reddit, are not interchangeable, the FTC argues.\nINCREASED ADS\nZuckerberg also disputed the FTC's claim that Meta is able to show users more ads because it lacks competitors, another key pillar of the case.\nWhile antitrust lawsuits typically look to a monopolist's ability to raise prices on customers, the FTC has pointed to Meta's ability to lower the quality of apps that users access for free, such as by increasing the number of ads.\nZuckerberg pushed back on the idea that more ads equals a worse user experience, saying that ads on Meta's apps have improved and its system is designed to \"show more ad content to people who like seeing ad content.\"\nMeta has even contemplated introducing a feed that was all ads, Zuckerberg suggested under questioning by FTC attorney Daniel Matheson.\n\"I think we have discussed it at different points but I don't think we have done it,\" Zuckerberg said.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in Washington and Katie Paul in New York; Editing by Alexandra Alper and Mark Porter)\nGroupe Dynamite Inc. says it expects to close about 10 stores that are mostly in Canada this fiscal year, even as it plans to open up to 20 more in the U.S. over the same time frame.\nBEIJING/CHICAGO (Reuters) -Global grain merchant Archer-Daniels-Midland has begun shutting down domestic trading operations in China and laying off staff within its largest business segment as part of a global cost-cutting push, the company said on Monday.  The company did not disclose the number of layoffs, but a source familiar with the matter said job cuts would impact 40 to 50 employees, leaving only around 10 staff in the financial hub of Shanghai.  \"The entire Ag Services and Oilseeds team in China has essentially been let go,\" the source said, referring to ADM's largest business segment.\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 The International Monetary Fund disbursed on Tuesday the first installment of Argentina's new $20 billion loan program after President Javier Milei removed most of Argentina\u2019s strict capital and currency controls.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on UNH. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH)'s share was trading at $587.06 as of April 14th. UNH\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 37.85 and 19.72 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nValeri Potapova/Shutterstock.com\nUnitedHealth Group stands as a powerful compounder in the healthcare space, benefiting from the defensive nature of health insurance\u2014a category of spending that consumers prioritize even during economic downturns. In uncertain times, discretionary expenses like tech upgrades, dining out, and travel are often the first to go, but health insurance remains untouchable due to the catastrophic financial consequences of going uninsured. This dynamic gives health insurers, especially UnitedHealth, exceptional pricing power, allowing them to pass on rising costs without losing customers. UnitedHealth\u2019s dominance is underpinned by its vertical integration, particularly through its health services arm, Optum, which continues to grow at a healthy clip above 10% annually. Despite recent concerns sparked by the tragic death of its insurance CEO and skepticism voiced by Bill Ackman regarding profitability, the company\u2019s fundamentals remain unshaken. These events created temporary dislocations in the stock, which long-term believers used as buying opportunities. UnitedHealth\u2019s revenue has compounded at 11% annually over the past five years, and despite modest net profit and return on equity margins at 5%, the consistency and resilience of its business model position it as a reliable performer in all market conditions. Its forward P/E of 20 reflects a fair valuation, especially considering the current environment. The stock has already gained 22% year-to-date, outperforming a declining S&P 500, and still presents a compelling opportunity for investors\u2014particularly on any dip below the $550 level. For those seeking tariff-proof exposure with strong cost-passing capabilities and a resilient growth engine, UnitedHealth remains a top-tier choice. The combination of its indispensable service, stable financials, and strategic integration make it a long-term winner, regardless of market cycles.\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) is on our list of the30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research head of the healthcare business unit Asad Haider joins Catalysts withMadison Millsand StoneX senior adviser Jon Hilsenrath to take a closer look at the earnings print and Johnson & Johnson's position as US President Trump pushes for tariffs on pharmaceutical imports.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\nJohnson & Johnson topped the street's expectations in its latest quarter, thanks to strong cancer drug sales during the 3-month period. The company boosted its full-year sales outlook, but tempered expectations for its adjusted operational profit, citing the impact of a recent acquisition and, of course, tariffs. President Trump has warned that levies will be placed on the sector very soon. Joining us now to discuss is Saad Hater, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research Head of the Healthcare Business Unit. Saad, great to speak with you. Let's start on Johnson & Johnson maintaining the EPS outlook. How were they able to do that in your view and what are your other big takeaways?\nYeah, thanks for having me. Um so, there there were some questions. I mean, overall, we thought that the quarter was actually very encouraging and very much in line with the thesis uh that we have on Johnson & Johnson. And just to zoom out for a second, we upgraded the stock to buy last week, uh based on our view that the innovative medicine business is going to continue to surprise on the upside and show encouraging trends. And that's really what you saw. Now, there was some gross margin related pressure, um which they cited, uh they attributed to Part D dynamics. This is the first quarter that the pharma industry is going to see uh some headwinds from the inflation reduction act, uh particularly related to Part D. Uh and there were also some tariff related costs that they that they talked about, um about $400 million that they attributed to the MedTech business. But beneath the hood, uh the pharma business did really well and their operating margins actually beat because they flex the P&L by cutting costs and cutting R&D. And to us, that was actually a very encouraging sign. And I think the combination of those things, along with a little bit of an FX tailwind, had them maintain uh the earnings for the year.\nAnd how are you thinking about the impact of tariffs, both on on Johnson & Johnson, and then just moving forward? Because they are the first pharma name to report, what does the what what did their results tell you about how the rest of the industry might be impacted by tariffs as well?\nWell, the short answer is not much. And I think uh it's still all very uncertain. I think uh we all have been waiting to see what the announcement for tariffs is. I think what's known, of course, is that uh the the pharmaceutical industry is going to have be tariffed, the way semiconductors and autos and several other industries are. Uh we've been waiting for this for a while. What we also know is that there has already been a section 232 investigation that has begun. Uh and uh depending on how that goes, uh what we're all going to be waiting for is to see what level of tariffs are going to be applied to the industry. And uh at this point, I just don't think we have a lot of clarity on any of that. And so, what that's been doing is creating a lot of uncertainty across the entire pharmaceutical sector. It's making people question the traditional orthodoxy around the margin structure and the profitability of this sector. But we just don't know a lot right now, and I think it would be too early for me to speculate on where this all lands. Uh but this is a cloud that the sector that it's an overhang on the sector. And until we get a real off-ramp, uh it's going to be hard to see how that uh um you know, how that overhang goes away.\nAnd Saad, my guest host, John Hilsenrath, is still with me. John, you got a question for Saad?\nSaad, you you talk about J&J flexing their earnings muscle by cutting costs and cutting R&D. Uh I'm listening to hear how all of this affects the economy, and that sounds like bad news to me.\nWell, I don't think it's I don't think it's bad news necessarily. I mean, I think we don't we don't really know uh line items on what exactly they did on the SG&A and the R&D side. I think it just speaks a little bit to the leverage that they have across the P&L to uh you know, make these types of investments. I think what's more interesting is just the way that Johnson & Johnson is has been responding, as I expect others to to to these tariff threats, which is uh building uh infrastructure, manufacturing facilities in the US. I think everyone saw that uh about 3 weeks ago, they announced a $55 billion manufacturing commitment to the US that is higher, that's about 25% higher than what they had initially said they'd do. Uh they opened a new facility in North Carolina, which they are going to use to manufacture in the US. And there's three other facilities that they're going to bring on the manufacturing side that are yet to come. So, I think those types of measures are probably more important for, as far as the overall economy goes, than them, these pharma companies, really flexing the the the the P&L in there with with things like SG&A and and R&D.\nYeah, Saad, I'm also curious how you're thinking about the impact of China and any China demand on this. John, I wonder if you have a question to that end as well.\nWell, I I mean, I'm I'm interested in in China, and I'm also interested in, you know, the risk that that they cut off supply chains and that that affects the supply chain of the pharma industry.\nI mean, John, I just don't think we know. I just think it's just too early to speculate how this all plays out. Um like I said, uh there are we are right now navigating navigating a period in the pharmaceutical sector where there are just a lot more questions than there are answers. I think it would be too premature for me to speculate uh on, you know, where uh what gets tariffed, what happens with China, what happens with demand. Um but our focus is just on fundamentals, and our call on J&J really has to do with the fact that their pharma business and some of the new product cycles within their pharma business are actually underappreciated, based on some of the diligence that we've done. And once this blows through, I mean, that's really where we'd be guiding investors.\nJ&J beats first-quarter earnings and sales estimates.

The company has selected Samsung Display as the exclusive supplier of OLED panels for the device, marking a rare shift from its usual multi-supplier strategy.\nIndustry sources say Apple chose Samsung for its proven ability to reduce screen creasesa crucial issue for foldable phones. The panels will likely resemble those used in the iPad Mini, with a 7.8-inch internal screen and a 5.5-inch external display. Pricing is expected to start around $2,000, putting it head-to-head with Samsung's own Galaxy Z Fold lineup.\nSamsung Display is expected to start deliveries by late 2025 or early 2026. The exclusive contract could help the company reclaim lost ground in the foldable OLED market, where its share had dropped to about 40% last year. Analysts now expect that number to climb back toward 70% in 2026, boosted by Apple's order.\nInitial projections put the foldable iPhone's annual production at 9 million units, but some forecasts now see it surpassing 15 million. That kind of volume could breathe new life into the sluggish foldable segment, which saw just 2.9% growth last year, according to Counterpoint Research.\nThe move is also seen as a strategic signal from Appleit's placing quality above price and taking a careful but deliberate step into a new product category.

Bank of America said its provision for credit loss was up by about $200 million from a year ago, but flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, an indication that the bank is not in panic mode.\nExecutives on the post-earnings call, though not dismissive of the recession threat, were upbeat about the bank's positioning, saying that the loan portfolio is more balanced than it has been in the past and calling the deposit base \"stable.\" If so, Bank of America might prove to be a good safe-harbor candidate for investors worried about turbulence up ahead.\nBefore you buy stock inBank of America, consider this:\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 andBank of Americawasn\u2019t one of them.

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nNvidia (NVDA,Financials)said it plans to manufactureas much as $500 billion worth of artificial intelligence servers in the United States over the next four years, a shift that aligns with broader efforts by American technology firms to bring production back home amid rising trade tensions.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nThe initiative will involve partnerships with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM,Financials), Foxconn and Wistron. According to the company, TSMC has started producing its latest-generation Blackwell AI chips at a facility in Phoenix, Arizona, while supercomputer production will begin in Texas within the next 12 to 15 months.\nThe move comes as President Donald Trump's administration pushes U.S. tech companies to increase domestic manufacturing in response to national security concerns and proposed tariffs on Chinese imports. Most of Nvidia's chips are currently produced in Taiwan.\nNvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said domestic manufacturing will support surging demand, bolster the supply chain and improve production resilience. The company estimated the effort will create hundreds of thousands of jobs over the next several decades.\nTrump responded to the announcement during a White House briefing, attributing the timing to the upcoming U.S. presidential election and newly proposed tariffs. Earlier this week, the United States exempted certain electronics such as smartphones and chips from tariff increases, though a rate for imported semiconductors is expected to be announced within days.\nD.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said the company's manufacturing plan was likely influenced by political pressure. He cast doubt on the $500 billion estimate, likening it to Apple's (AAPL,Financials) earlier pledge to invest a similar amount in U.S.-based projects.\nIn March, Huang had indicated that Nvidia saw minimal short-term effects from potential tariffs, but said the company would consider shifting production to the U.S. over the long term.

He was named COO in October 2023, widely seen as a precursor to his elevation to CEO.\nAnalysts highlighted Creed\u2019s leadership in Energy & Transportation as key to Caterpillar\u2019s evolving strategy.Barclays noted investor focus on the segment has grown alongside demand for data centers and power generation, where Caterpillar sees potential for competitive differentiation.\nUmpleby\u2019s tenure is credited with restoring stability and profitability through a renewed focus on core businesses.Barclays said his leadership saw Caterpillar streamline its operations, prioritize R&D, and make selective, strategic acquisitions like the $400 million deal for Weir\u2019s Oil & Gas unit.\nRelated articles\nWall Street sees strategic continuity as Caterpillar names Creed CEO\nBofA downgrades U.S. chemical sector amid slowdown\nBernstein starts Xiaomi at \u2018outperform,\u2019 sees EV push as key equity driver\nCaterpillar has decided to make a change at the top, replacing Jim Umpleby with Joe Creed.\nThe Dow Jones rose on the stock market today and auto stocks popped after President Donald Trump spoke out.

White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said in a statement that Trump \u201chas made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops.\u201d Desai added, \u201cAt the direction of the President, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Dan Ives, head of technology research at Wedbush, told CNBC, \u201cThis is the dream scenario for tech investors. Smartphones, chips being excluded is a game changer scenario when it comes to China tariffs.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump stated in a Truth Socialpost, \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019 for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst! There was no Tariff \u2018exception\u2019 announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u2018bucket.\u2019 The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America, which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate, will mean more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us.\u201d\nBIG RELIEF:JPMorgan lowered the firm\u2019s price target on Apple(AAPL) to $245 from $270 but kept an Overweight rating on the shares, saying the latest updates from the Trump administration late on Friday, exempting smartphones and PCs from reciprocal tariffs, is a \u201cbig relief\u201d for Apple. While the exemption will help return investor focus back to some of the company\u2019s medium-term drivers, \u201cseveral concerns\u201d remain from the developments over the last two weeks, the firm tells investors in a research note. JPMorgan thinks these will \u201climit investors from immediately turning to any bull case\u201d for Apple.Semiconductortariffs are still to be announced and could impact Apple, adds the firm. JPMorgan updated its estimates for lower demand from the macro slowdown and potential further downside risk on the resumption of tariffs. It forecasts slowing demand from fiscal Q4 into fiscal 2026 and revised its fiscal 2026 and 2027 iPhone volume expectations to 232M and 242M, respectively, from 249M and 255M units prior.\nDEPORTATION EFFORTS:Prison operatorGeoGroup(GEO)has built a lucrative side business of digital tools to surveil immigrants on behalf of the federal government over the last decade, making it one of the Trump administration\u2019s big business winners amid deportations, the New York Times\u2019 Paul Mozur, Adam Satariano and Aaron Krolikreport, citing legal aid groups and immigration organizations. The company\u2019s ankle monitors, smart watches and tracking apps are aiding the government by providing the locations of unauthorized immigrants to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and legal groups estimate the number of arrests made from the digital monitoring programs is at least in the hundreds.\nU.S. STEEL:U.S President Donald Trump reaffirmed that he does not believe a foreign company should control U.S. Steel(X), following similar comments he made regarding the $15B takeover bid by Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel(NPSCY), Reuters\u2019 Jeff Mason and Kantaro Komiyareport, citing remarks Trump made to reporters. On Wednesday, Trump stated that he didn\u2019t want to see the company \u201cgo to Japan\u201d causing a 7% drop in the company\u2019s stock value. Following the comment, both companies stated they were collaborating with the administration \u201cto secure a significant investment\u201d, however on Sunday, Trump affirmed his stance, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think a foreign company should control U.S. Steel.\u201d\nPublished first onTheFly\u2013 the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.Try Now>>\nSee today\u2019s best-performing stocks on TipRanks >>\nRead More on AAPL:\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue\nApple upgraded, Wayfair downgraded: Wall Street\u2019s top analyst calls\nUnusually active option classes on open April 14th\nApple price target lowered to $230 from $290 at DA Davidson\nMorning Movers: Goldman Sachs gains following first quarter results\nNotable open interest changes for April 14th\nTo the relief of anyone with an aging iPhone, the Trump administration exempted smartphones, computers, and other tech products from its punishing tariffs on Chinese imports over the weekend.

(Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)\nSales rose 2.4% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an operational increase of 4.2% and a negative currency impact of 1.8%.

Innovative Medicines sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.46 billion as well as our model estimate of $13.57 billion.\nHigher sales of key products such as Darzalex, Tremfya and Erleada due to strong market growth and share gains drove the segment\u2019s growth. Xarelto and Simponi/Simponi Aria sales also rose in the quarter. New drugs like Carvykti, Tecvayli, Talvey, Rybrevant and Spravato also contributed to growth. The sales growth was partially dampened by lower sales of key drugs, Stelara, Imbruvica, Uptravi, and generic/biosimilar competition to drugs like Zytiga and Remicade.\nSales of blockbuster multiple myeloma medicine Darzalex rose 20.3% year over year to $3.24 billion in the quarter. Sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.13 billion and our model estimate of $3.15 billion.\nSales of the blockbuster psoriasis drug Stelara declined 33.7% to $1.63 billion in the quarter due to the impact of current and potential biosimilar competition. While U.S. sales of Stelara declined 29.8%, international sales declined 38.9% in the quarter. Stelara sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.64 billion as well as our model estimate of $1.66 billion.\nA biosimilar version of Stelara was launched in certain European markets for some indications in July 2024. Several biosimilar versions of Stelara are expected to be launched in the United States in 2025.AmgenAMGN launched the first Stelara biosimilar, Wezlana, in January 2025, whileTeva Pharmaceutical IndustriesTEVA launched Selarsdi in February 2025.

Stelara biosimilar competition is expected to accelerate throughout 2025 as the number of biosimilar entrants increases.\nImbruvica sales declined 9.5% to $709.0 million. Rising competitive pressure in the United States due to new oral competition has been hurting Imbruvica's sales for the past few quarters. Imbruvica sales were, however, better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $678.0 million and our estimate of $703.0\nErleada generated sales of $771.0 million in the quarter, up 11.9% year over year.

Simponi/Simponi Aria sales rose 18.9% to $659.0 million, while Prezista sales declined 3.7% to $403.0 million.\nZytiga sales declined 30.9% to $129.0 million in the quarter due to generic competition. Sales of Remicade rose 7.5% in the quarter to $467.0 million.\nMedTech segment sales came in at $8.02 billion, up 2.5% from the year-ago period, as an operational increase of 4.1% was offset by a negative currency movement of 1.6%. MedTech segment sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as our model estimate of $8.14 billion.\nExcluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, and currency, on an adjusted operational basis, worldwide sales rose 1.3%.\nSales in the MedTech business are being driven by new product uptake and commercial execution, which is being partially offset by continued headwinds in Asia Pacific, specifically in China and increased competitive pressure in some MedTech businesses. Sales in China in the first quarter were hurt by the impact of the volume-based procurement (VBP) program. VBP is a government-driven cost containment effort in China.\nThe company raised its sales expectations for 2025 to reflect the addition of schizophrenia drug Caplyta, following the $14.6 billion acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies closed earlier this month.\nThe sales guidance was raised from a range of $89.2 billion-$90.0 billion to $91.0 billion-$91.8 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $90.22 billion.\nThe sales range indicates growth in the range of 2.6%-3.6% versus the prior expectation of 0.5%-1.5%. Operational sales growth is expected in the range of 3.3%-4.3% (previously 2.5%-3.5%).\nThe adjusted operational sales (excluding currency impact, acquisitions/divestitures) growth guidance was maintained in the range of 2.0%-3.0%.\nThe adjusted earnings per share guidance was maintained in the range of $10.50-$10.70. J&J said that the guidance range includes tariff costs and dilution from the\u00a0Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $10.54 per share.\nThe earnings range implies growth in the range of 5.2% to 7.2%.\nJ&J beat first-quarter estimates for both earnings and sales. Despite the loss of exclusivity (\u201cLOE\u201d) of Stelara, its Innovative Medicines unit once again outperformed expectations, with sales of key drugs Darzalex and Tremfya beating estimates. However, Erleada and Uptravi\u2019s sales slightly missed expectations. The Stelara LOE hurt revenue growth by 810 basis points in the quarter.\nMedTech unit\u2019s sales also missed estimates. J&J slightly raised its sales guidance while keeping the EPS range intact.

In 2025, J&J expects growth in the Innovative Medicine segment to be driven by its key products, such as Darzalex, Tremfya, Spravato and Erleada, as well as new drugs like Carvykti, Tecvayli and Talvey, and new indications for Tremfya and Rybrevant.\nJ&J is also making rapid progress with its pipeline and has been on an acquisition spree lately, which has strengthened its pipeline.\nHowever, the softness in the MedTech unit, the Stelara patent cliff and the potential impact of Part D redesign will be significant headwinds in 2025. It remains to be seen how the company navigates them. The legal battle surrounding its talc lawsuits has created a bearish sentiment around the stock. The lawsuits allege that its talc products contain asbestos, which caused many women to develop ovarian and some other cancers. Earlier this month, a bankruptcy court in Texas rejected J&J\u2019s proposed bankruptcy plan to settle its talc lawsuits. J&J will go back to the traditional tort system to fight lawsuits individually, using its bankruptcy strategy to settle lawsuits that fail for the third time.\nJ&J currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nJohnson & Johnson price-consensus-chart | Johnson & Johnson Quote\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates in a worst-case scenario, the hit this year from reduced travel and boycotts could total 0.3% of gross domestic product, which would amount to almost $90 billion.\nForeign tourism has been a tailwind for the US in recent years as the cessation of pandemic-era restrictions sparked a resurgence of international travel. But many potential visitors are now rethinking their vacation plans amid increased hostility at the border, rising geopolitical frictions and global economic uncertainty.\nOne of them is Curtis Allen, a Canadian videographer who canceled an upcoming US vacation after President Donald Trump imposed punitive tariffs on his home country and suggested it should become the 51st US state. Allen and his partner have been on multiple camping trips to Oregon over the years, but this year, they will be traveling around British Columbia instead.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just staying home,\u201d said Allen, 34. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go spend the same money somewhere else.\u201d\nAllen\u2019s hesitance doesn\u2019t stop there. He canceled his Netflix subscription and is actively avoiding American imports at the grocery store.\n\u201cNow it takes us double the time, because we\u2019re looking at where the products came from,\u201d he said.\nInternational travelers spent a record $254 billion in the US last year, according to ITA figures. Coming into 2025, the outlook was positive: The ITA projected in early March that the US would welcome 77 million visitors this year, just shy of the 2019 record, before pushing to a new high in 2026.\nBut those estimates came out just before stories of harsh detentions at US airports, ensnaring travelers from countries like France and Germany, started making headlines. Major public institutions in Canada, including a pension management firm and a leading hospital, are now advising staff against traveling to the US.\nAlmost $20 billion in retail spending from international tourists in the US may be at risk, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis.\nEarly signs of a sharp pullback are already showing up. Airfares, hotel rates and car rental costs fell in March, according to a monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics report on consumer prices published April 10. Economists at Goldman Sachs and HSBC Holdings Plc said lower demand, including from foreign travelers, probably played a role.\nOmair Sharif, president of Inflation Insights, noted the decline in hotel rates was driven by an almost 11% drop in the Northeast in particular, possibly a result of fewer Canadians traveling there.\n\u201cGiven what we know about how much Canadian travel has fallen off, that\u2019s potentially a bit worrying for that region,\u201d Sharif said.\nThe timing is \u201cvery interesting\u201d for Rainbow Air Helicopter Tours in Niagara Falls \u2014 which just invested $25 million in a new building, an enhanced fleet and a virtual reality attraction ahead of the busy summer season \u2014 said Patrick Keyes, the firm\u2019s sales and marketing manager. \u201cWe are waiting to see the fallout,\u201d he said.\nCanadian flight reservations to the US are down 70% through September versus the same period last year, according to a report by OAG Aviation Worldwide. Meanwhile US summer bookings are also down 25% among European tourists at Accor SA hotels \u2014 which Chief Executive Officer S\u00e9bastien Bazin said could be attributed to border detentions creating a \u201cbad buzz\u201d and diverting tourists to other destinations.\n\u201cUS tariff announcements and a more aggressive stance toward historical allies have hurt global opinions about the US,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Megan Peters said in a March 31 report.\n\u201cThis headwind provides another reason \u2014 in addition to the more direct negative impacts of tariffs and drag on exports from foreign retaliation that are already built into our US GDP forecast \u2014 why US GDP growth will likely underperform consensus expectations in 2025,\u201d they said.\nDespite the worsening outlook, Oregon\u2019s tourism commission \u2014 known as Travel Oregon \u2014 is continuing efforts to attract foreign visitors, said CEO Todd Davidson. His team just came back from a trip to pitch the state at an adventure tourism conference in Vancouver, and in the coming weeks they will be hosting sales and marketing partners from places like the UK, India and Brazil.\nAt the same time, they\u2019re also contemplating whether the commission will need to shift its strategy more toward domestic visitors as the situation unfolds.\n\u201cOregon is not and will not take its eye off those international markets,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cWe will be here when our international visitors feel that they are ready to return.\u201d\n(Updates to add Canada executives advising against US travel in ninth paragraph.)\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\nWorkers should replace 80% of their income for each year of retirement, new research suggests\nThe Dow Jones rose on the stock market today and auto stocks popped after President Donald Trump spoke out.

The firm points out that it has argued that this program has received almost too much attention \u2013 not because obesity isn\u2019t important, but because this was only phase 1 data. Without danuglipron, Pfizer\u2019s obesity pipeline now consists of a GIP receptor antagonist in phase 2 and a phase 1 oral GLP-1 in T2D with Nxera Pharma. If the company is committed to obesity, a possible next step could be business development, BofA argues.

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nArista Networks, Inc.ANET andCisco Systems, Inc.CSCO are two of the leading players in the global networking industry. Arista offers one of the broadest product lines of data center and campus Ethernet switches and routers in the industry. It provides routing and switching platforms with industry-leading capacity, low latency, port density and power efficiency.On the other hand, Cisco is the largest player in the networking space. The company has a strong presence in the router and switch market. It has retained a leadership position in WLAN and Ethernet switching and is rapidly expanding its presence in the network security domain. Cisco provides Next-Generation Network Routers that transport data, voice and video information from one IP network to another.With a diversified portfolio of cloud networking solutions for data centers and cloud computing environments, both Arista and Cisco have the wherewithal to cater to the evolving demands of business enterprises. Let us delve a little deeper into the companies\u2019 competitive dynamics to understand which of the two is relatively better placed in the industry.\nArista holds a leadership position in 100-gigabit Ethernet switches and is increasingly gaining market traction in 200-and-400-gig high-performance switching products. It is witnessing solid demand trends among enterprise customers backed by its multi-domain modern software approach, which is built upon its unique and differentiating foundation, the single EOS (Extensible Operating System) and CloudVision stack. Arista has made several additions to its multi-cloud and cloud-native software product family with CloudEOS Edge. It has introduced new cognitive Wi-Fi software that delivers intelligent application identification, automated troubleshooting and location services. The versatility of Arista\u2019s unified software stack across various use cases, including WAN routing and campus and data center infrastructure, sets it apart from other competitors in the industry.In addition to high capacity and easy availability, its cloud networking solutions promise predictable performance and programmability, enabling integration with third-party applications for network management, automation and orchestration. The company boasts a comprehensive portfolio with the right network architecture for client-to-campus data center cloud and AI (artificial intelligence) networking backed by three guiding principles. These include best-in-class, highly proactive products with resilience, zero-touch automation and telemetry with predictive client-to-cloud one-click operations with granular visibility and prescriptive insights for deeper AI algorithms. Arista should benefit from its software-driven, data-centric approach that helps customers build their cloud architecture and enhance the cloud experience they offer their clients.However, Arista remains plagued by high operating costs. Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2024 increased around 20% to $431.3 million, owing to a rise in headcount, new product introduction costs and higher variable compensation expenditures. Selling, general & administrative and R&D expenses increased at a CAGR of 23.1% from 2013 to 2023. Moreover, the redesigning of products and their supply chain mechanism has eroded margins. Although the company is witnessing increased demand, there are lingering supply bottlenecks for advanced products. Therefore, it is increasing orders for these components and trying to build up inventory, which is blocking working capital.\nCisco is expanding its Agentic AI footprint with the introduction of Webex AI Agent, Cisco AI Assistant for Webex Contact Center, Workflow Automation in Cisco AI Assistant for Webex, AI Capabilities in Webex Control Hub and Webex Calling Customer Assist. Its strategy of infusing AI across security and collaboration platforms and developing agentic capabilities across the portfolio is a key catalyst for improving customer experience. The launch of Renewals Agent, an Agentic AI-driven solution co-developed with Mistral, and a new Assistant to help customers digitize and de-risk Network Change Management have been noteworthy developments in this regard.Cisco is expanding its portfolio with the unveiling of AI factory architecture developed in collaboration withNVIDIA CorporationNVDA. In late February, Cisco inked an expanded partnership with NVIDIA, under which the companies plan to offer solutions that help build AI-ready data center networks. Cisco Secure AI Factory with NVIDIA is founded on the NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform. The NVIDIA-based CSCO AI POD product, which comprises hardware and software, is gaining traction. The launch of 800 gig Nexus switches based on Cisco\u2019s 51.2 terabit Silicon One chip is expected to drive orders from AI-based cloud customers.However, Cisco has been forced to offer discounts and deals in response to stiff competition from other players like Arista andJuniper Networks Inc.JNPR in the Ethernet switch and router market. Cisco\u2019s competitors are revamping their product lines with faster and power-efficient products. Although the edge business remains strong, the competitive pressure at the core remains intense and is likely to hurt profitability. Moreover, Cisco\u2019s near-term prospects are likely to suffer from declining new orders, hurting top-line growth.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Arista\u2019s 2025 sales and EPS implies a year-over-year growth of 18% and 8.8%, respectively. The EPS estimates have been trending northward over the past 60 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cisco\u2019s 2025 sales implies a year-over-year growth of 4.9%, while that for EPS implies a decline of 0.3%. The EPS estimates have been trending northward over the past 60 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nOver the past year, Arista has gained 12.1% compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 7.3%. Cisco has gained 19.8% over the same period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCisco looks more attractive than Arista from a valuation standpoint. Going by the price/earnings ratio, Cisco\u2019s shares currently trade at 14.76 forward earnings, significantly lower than 28.5 for Arista.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nArista carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Cisco carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Both companies expect their sales and profits to improve in 2025. Arista has shown steady revenue and EPS growth for years, while Cisco has been facing a bumpy road. However, with a superior Zacks Rank, better price performance and attractive valuation metrics, Cisco appears to be a better investment option at the moment.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nNew economic data is out this morning, some of it reflecting conditions prior to our current tariff realities. We also see Q1 earnings results continue to ramp up, but we won\u2019t have the spigots open completely til next week. Pre-markets are down somewhat, following a +3/4-percent gain on the Dow and the S&P 500, +2/3-percent gain for the Nasdaq.\nHeadlineImport Pricesfor last month have arrived, marking the first monthly negative since September of last year: -0.1%. This is down from the +0.1% estimate and the prior two months up +0.4%. Subtracting volatile fuel prices, an \u201cunched\u201d headline, 0.0%, is down -30 basis points (bps) from estimates and the previous month\u2019s headline.\nYear over year, Import Prices reached +0.9%, 60 bps lower than the +1.5% anticipated by analysts and 110 bps lower month over month, from February. Keep in mind, this pricing was all conducted under the specter of a new tariff regime conditioning markets. It\u2019s tough to know exactly how these numbers reflect this directly, but we expect to look back a few months and see clearly where tariff policy took hold.\nExportsfor March were also \u201cunched\u201d month over month, but still +2.4% year over year. This is now the third straight month with Exports at or above +2% \u2014 the strongest such trend since the end of 2022, and again likely reflecting methods of exporters getting ahead of April tariffs. We do not expect such benign levels when these metrics report a month from now.\nThe latestEmpire Statesurvey, tracking New York state manufacturing for the month of April, posted a negative headline number, -8.1, which was an improvement from the -10.0 estimate and -20.0 reported for March, which was the lowest performance rate since a year-ago January. The last positive Empire State headline was January of this year: +5.7.\nBank of AmericaBAC is the latest of the big Wall Street commercial banks to report Q1 earnings, and the company posted its 11th-straight earnings beat: earnings of 90 cents per share outpaced the Zacks consensus of 81 cents by +11%. Revenues of $27.37 billion in the quarter surpassed expectations by +1.89%. Shares are up +2% in early trading, working down some of the -16% loss year to date.\nPharmaceutical and household products makerJohnson & JohnsonJNJ outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines for its Q1 this morning, with earnings of $2.77 per share beating the Zacks consensus by 20 cents (and swinging to a profit year over year by 6 cents per share) on revenues of $21.89 billion \u2014 surpassing expectations by +1.26%. However, an unchanged earnings per share (EPS) guide for the full year is pulling shares down -1.5% in the news, after having grown +6% year to date\nBack to the banks,CitigroupC also posted solid beats in its Q1 report this morning, with earnings of $1.96 per share bettering estimates by 12 cents per share and +21% from year-ago numbers. Revenues of $21.6 billion was a step ahead of the $21.18 billion in the Zacks consensus. Expenses for the quarter fell by -5% to $13.4 billion.

Guidance is notably more critical this reporting cycle, given the recent tariff-induced spooks that we\u2019ve become accustomed to.\nImportantly, several notable large-cap stocks are reporting this week, a list that includes Progressive PGR and UnitedHealth UNH. As shown below, PGR and UNH shares have shown great relative strength in 2025.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at what to expect from each.\nUnitedHealth Group offers a full spectrum of health benefits, with its Optum segment using data and technology to improve care delivery and health outcomes.\nUNH is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the earnings estimate revisions trend for its upcoming release largely stable over recent months.

The company offers various insurance products, including auto, home, renters, and commercial lines.\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with earnings expectations moving higher across the board.

I think in in the case of Bank of America and City Group, um, they're both very encouraging results. These are both stocks that we are recommending. And I I think what, um, in both cases and and we're seeing is a reiteration of the financial outlooks that we were expecting. So in the case of Bank of America, for example, a big part of the bull case is that the net interest income outlook is very encouraging and that you would see growth throughout the course of the year. And the guidance is for that growth to that net interest income uh, figure to reach 15.5 to 15.7 billion uh, by the fourth quarter. That's a pretty big increases versus current levels. And they reiterated that guidance, and not only did they reiterate that guidance, they had very good core trends in a lot of in a lot of realms. Deposit costs came out came down. They're actually seeing better than peer loan growth. Uh, they're seeing good deposit trends. So the underlying, um, you know, trends that sort of uh, reinforce the the investment thesis for Bank of America, I think were really reiterated by the results. In the in City Group's case, we haven't, you know, their call will be at 11. I think, you know, similarly, they reiterated the full year guidance for revenues and costs. And a lot of the core trends were actually very good. This was a subdued quarter for investment banking, for example, for a lot of companies. Actually, City Group outperformed on investment banking. They're seeing good momentum in wealth management. Um, net interest income is growing. Um, the expense number was good. So, you know, first blush, I think a lot of the underlying trends are encouraging, and I think the other thing I would just mention here is that coming into the quarter for all of the financials, we really focused on what the message from management was going to be. Was the tone going to be confident or were, you know, concerns going to be expressed? And broadly speaking, the message has really been that the sky is not falling. You know, there have been some nuances here, Jamie, uh, you know, maybe a little bit more, uh, you know, in the realm of highlighting downside risks, but but generally a pretty nuanced view where they're indicating corporates are delaying decisions, but, you know, there there's optimism about policy clarity later this year, the regulatory agenda, you know, tax cuts being extension extended, and folks are still spending in early April. So, you know, the sky is not falling has been the message, and I think that's been well received.\nCiti and Bank of America posted first-quarter net interest income of $14 billion and $14.4 billion, respectively.  Wall Street expected $14.49 billion of NII for the quarter at BofA, according to data compiled by FactSet, and $13.56 billion at Citi.  BofA said in January that it expected to drive between $14.5 billion and $14.6 billion of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the first quarter.\nCitigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) reported on Tuesday that the first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenue growth was 3% year-over-year and was $21.6 billion, beating the analyst consensus of $21.29 billion. This growth was driven by each of the five interconnected businesses. Excluding divestiture-related impacts in both periods, revenues also went up 3%. The U.S. banking giant reported earnings per share of $1.96, increased from $1.58 a year ago, beating the consensus of $1.84. Also Read: JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, M\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Citigroup beat Wall Street estimates for first-quarter profit on Tuesday and moved closer to its profitability target as its traders reaped a windfall from volatile markets that fueled client activity.  The third-largest U.S. lender's earnings echoed those of Wall Street rivals, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley, whose results were also lifted by stronger equities trading.  While industry profits rose, executives warned that U.S. tariff policies cast a shadow over the economic outlook.\nCiti plans to spend more in 2025 than it did last year on fixing long-running risk, data, and compliance deficiencies, as it carries out a yearslong turnaround plan that it refers to as its \u201ctransformation.\u201d  Citi CFO Mark Mason said on a call with reporters that the firm is working to move away from manual activity and automate parts of its risk management processes and compliance programs.  Citi is prioritizing its efforts to try and change that.\n(Reuters) -Bank of America topped estimates on Tuesday for first-quarter profit as interest income grew and volatile markets helped its stock traders rake in a record haul, lifting its shares more than 4%.  \"There is a lot to potentially change given the uncertainty around the tariffs and the policies on the future path of the economy,\" CEO Brian Moynihan told analysts on a call.  Equities trading jumped 17% to a record $2.2 billion, while fixed income, currencies and commodities trading revenue jumped 5% to $3.5 billion, propelling its markets revenue to the highest in more than a decade.\nThe start of a new trading week was quite the boon for established Chinese tech stocks.  A respite -- perhaps even a reversal -- in the recent trade conflict with the U.S. resulted in a surge of bullishness for the sector, and a host of known titles saw encouraging price boosts.  Among these were Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA), which notched a nearly 6% gain on the day.\nBank of America\u2019s chief executive, Brian Moynihan, said consumers are still spending despite polls that show people are worried about the economy.  \u201cThe economy is still growing and our consumers are still spending,\u201d Moynihan said on CNBC on Tuesday, after the bank reported an increase in quarterly profit and revenue.  Moynihan said Bank of America\u2019s analysts are lowering growth forecasts and increasing expectations of a recession.\nC's first-quarter 2025 results benefit from a rise in NII and a fall in expenses.

J&J also guided for estimated reported sales of $91.4 billion, up from a previous $89.6 billion.\nHealth care giant Johnson & Johnson expects about $400 million in tariff-related costs this year.

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nBy Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Apple's (AAPL) main India suppliers Foxconn and Tata shipped nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones to the United States in March, an all-time high, as the U.S. company airlifted devices to bypass President Donald Trump's impending tariffs, customs data shows.\nThe smartphone maker stepped up production in India and chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tons of iPhones to the United States to ensure sufficient inventory in one of its biggest markets on concern Trump's tariffs would push up costs.\nIn April, the U.S. administration imposed 26% duties on imports from India, much lower than the more than 100% China was facing at the time. Trump has since paused most duties, except for China for three months.\nFoxconn, Apple's main India supplier, exported smartphones worth $1.31 billion in March, its highest ever for a single month and equal to shipments for January and February combined, according to commercially available customs data reviewed by Reuters.\nThis included Apple iPhone 13, 14, 16 and 16e models, and took Foxconn's total shipments from India to the United States this year to $5.3 billion.\nExports from Tata Electronics, another Apple supplier, stood at $612 million in March, around 63% higher than the previous month, and included iPhone 15 and 16 models.\nApple, Foxconn and Tata did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters is the first to report the shipment details.\nCustoms data showed all Foxconn shipments to the United States in March were by air from the Chennai Air Cargo terminal, and landed at various locations, including Los Angeles and New York, with Chicago receiving the majority.\nTrump later granted exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones and some other electronics imported largely from China, but later indicated that those exemptions will likely be short-lived.\nTo expedite shipments, Apple lobbied Indian airport authorities to cut the time needed to clear customs at Chennai airport in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, to six hours down from 30 hours.\nAt least six cargo jets were used in the operation which one source described was a way to \"beat the tariffs\".\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil; Editing by Sharon Singleton)\n(Bloomberg) -- Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade.

Canada has slapped a range of counter-tariffs on the U.S. in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel, aluminum, cars and auto parts.  The impact of the trade war between the U.S. and Canada is already evident, with some Canadian companies shedding jobs and some forecasting drops in sales and profits.\nU.S. policy on stablecoins offers European citizens an attractive payment method for cross-border transactions which should trigger more concern than trade tariffs, Italy's economy minister said on Tuesday.  Addressing an event in Milan on asset management, Giancarlo Giorgetti said European Union authorities should adopt further steps to boost the status of the euro as an international reference currency and complained about the fragmentation of the EU's payment industry.  U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to overhaul rules on cryptocurrencies and reverse a crackdown on the sector that took place under his predecessor Joe Biden.\nFrench-Italian carmaker Stellantis has reduced its shortlist of CEO candidates to five, said two people familiar with the matter, as it nears a decision on who will lead the company through one of the industry's most tumultuous periods.

As the U.S. auto industry confronts major tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, executives and analysts are drawing parallels with Brazil, once the world's fourth-largest auto market and now a case study in the dangers of protectionism.  Philipp Schiemer, former head of Mercedes-Benz in Brazil and Latin America, learned some of those lessons the hard way as he opened a plant in Sao Paulo making luxury cars, which was shut down in 2020.\nPARIS (Reuters) -Nearly three dozen global pharmaceutical companies, in a letter to the head of the European Commission, demanded help to maintain operations in the EU despite threatened U.S. tariffs on imports, including measures to compensate them for the cost of pharmaceutical innovations, French business newspaper Les Echos reported on Tuesday.  In the letter sent to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the companies -- including Pfizer, Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca -- said they face cost disadvantages in Europe versus the United States, where drugs are sold at prices that on average are twice that of some European countries, such as France, Les Echos reported.\nOne of the biggest two-day sell-offs in stock market history saw investors pile into the stock market earlier this month.\nTrump wants low interest rates, but his own tariffs are pushing them higher. Investors now fear some unorthodox scheme to force rates down that could end up even worse than tariffs.\nThe Dow Jones rose on the stock market today and auto stocks popped after President Donald Trump spoke out.

However, tariffs on the chips \"would be less of a problem\" because Chinese manufacturers put many chips into consumer electronic products, he stated.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.CMG stock's premium valuation \u2014 trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 36.81X \u2014 has raised eyebrows, especially as the restaurant industry braces for potential disruption from renewed trade tensions and tariff threats. The stock is trading above the Zacks Retail-Restaurant industry\u2019s average of 25.12X and the broader Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s 22.11X.The warning signals come as restaurant chains, including peers likeBrinker International, Inc.EAT,McDonald's CorporationMCD andYum! Brands, Inc.YUM face dual threats: slowing discretionary spending and geopolitical risk. Looming macroeconomic risks, concerns around inflation, retaliatory tariffs, and rising labor costs are beginning to cast a shadow over CMG\u2019s near-term prospects.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSo far this year, shares of Chipotle have declined 18.1% compared with the Zacks Retail \u2013 Restaurants industry\u2019s fall of 1.5%. The stock has underperformed the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s and the S&P 500\u2019s declines of 5.7% and 8.4%, respectively.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a technical perspective, Chipotle stock is currently trading below its 50-day moving average, signaling a bearish trend.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAnalysts and investors alike are starting to question how sustainable Chipotle\u2019s momentum is under these conditions. Let\u2019s find out.\nMacro Pressures Are Building:The broader economic environment is starting to catch up with even the most resilient players. Inflation remains sticky, interest rates are still elevated, and consumers are becoming more price-conscious. As a premium fast-casual brand, Chipotle is particularly vulnerable to this shift.Declining profitability remains a concern for CMG. During the fourth quarter of 2024, Restaurant-level margins contracted 60 basis points year over year to 24.8%, weighed down by rising input costs and portion-related investments. Despite promises of back-half relief from initiatives like produce slicers and back-of-house modernization, management expects margin pressure to linger into the first half of 2025.While many restaurant chains are seeing signs of consumer trade-down behavior, Chipotle has continued to raise menu prices to offset inflationary pressures. This strategy worked well during earlier waves of inflation, but there are signs that consumer tolerance for higher prices may be peaking. The brand's value perception is at risk, especially as grocery inflation moderates and home cooking becomes a more attractive alternative for budget-minded customers.\nTariff Troubles on the Horizon:Chipotle may also find itself caught in the crosshairs of geopolitical trade friction. With about 2% of Chipotle\u2019s product cost tied to imports from Mexico \u2014 including avocados, tomatoes and peppers \u2014 the newly announced tariffs could shave an additional 60 basis points off margins if implemented fully. While management has done commendable work diversifying suppliers, the risk remains non-trivial. A spike in input costs could pressure margins and force further price hikes, which may not be well received by customers already feeling the pinch.Other major chains like Brinker, YUM! Brands and McDonald's have acknowledged the potential impact of tariffs, suggesting broader industry-wide implications. Chipotle, despite its nimbleness, is not immune to these macro-level risks.\nChipotle\u2019s 2025 earnings per share (EPS) estimates have been revised downward, dropping from $1.29 to $1.27 over the past 60 days. This downward trend reflects weakening analyst confidence in the stock\u2019s near-term prospects.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNevertheless, the company is likely to report strong earnings, with projections indicating 13.4% year-over-year growth in 2025. Conversely, industry players like Brinker, YUM! Brands and McDonald's are likely to witness a rise of 102.7%, 9.3% and 4.5%, year over year, respectively.\nDespite the concerns, Chipotle is not without its strengths. The company continues to set itself apart by focusing on high-quality, customizable food served quickly in a clean and consistent environment. As part of its broader strategy, Chipotle is doubling down on speed and service through operational upgrades and managerial stability, which are helping drive strong customer loyalty and higher transaction volumes.To further elevate the customer experience, Chipotle has made significant investments in digital innovation and restaurant design. With digital orders now accounting for more than a third of its sales, the company\u2019s mobile app and \u201cChipotlane\u201d drive-thru pickup windows are creating faster, more convenient ways for customers to engage with the brand. These enhancements not only increase average check sizes but also boost efficiency, contributing to stronger unit economics and improving throughput during peak hours.On the sourcing side, Chipotle has taken early steps to mitigate tariff risk by diversifying avocado suppliers beyond Mexico. While not a full hedge, it does reduce exposure relative to less-prepared peers. Additionally, the brand\u2019s focus on automation and kitchen innovation could help offset wage inflation and maintain unit economics.Chipotle is also positioning itself for global expansion, with promising early traction in Canada, Europe, and the Middle East. By tailoring its strategy for international markets while maintaining its core values, the company is showing that its model can travel. Domestically, it continues to pursue its goal of reaching 7,000 locations, backed by strong unit economics and growing average unit volumes. Together, these efforts are positioning Chipotle for long-term margin expansion and sustainable growth.\nAnalysts maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook on Chipotle\u2019s stock. Based on short-term price targets from 31 analysts, the average price target is $64.84, suggesting a potential upside of 31.1% from the last closing price of $49.46. Price forecasts range from a low of $48.00, indicating a 2.95% downside risk, to a high of $72.00, which represents a possible 45.6% upside. Meanwhile, Chipotle carries a solid average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.52 on a scale of 1 (Strong Buy) to 5 (Strong Sell), reflecting a favorable consensus. Among 32 brokerage firms, 22 analysts rate the stock as a Strong Buy and three as a Buy, underscoring confidence in Chipotle\u2019s growth potential.\nChipotle remains a strong brand within the fast-casual dining space, backed by its commitment to food quality, digital innovation, and long-term expansion plans. Despite current macroeconomic pressures, including inflation, rising labor costs, and looming tariff threats, the company\u2019s proactive steps \u2014 such as supplier diversification, automation, and a focus on customer experience \u2014 highlight its operational agility and long-term vision. Continued digital investment and international expansion further strengthen its position for future growth.\nThat said, Chipotle\u2019s elevated valuation and recent underperformance relative to its industry and broader market introduce caution into the near-term outlook. Margin pressure, waning consumer tolerance for price hikes and geopolitical uncertainties could weigh on earnings and sentiment in the coming quarters. The stock\u2019s downward earnings estimate revisions and technical weakness add to investment hesitancy.\nGiven these dynamics, existing investors may consider holding on to this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock as Chipotle works through short-term headwinds and executes its strategic initiatives. However, new investors might find it wise to remain on the sidelines until macro risks moderate and momentum begins to recover, especially considering the stock\u2019s premium valuation and recent volatility.\nYou can seethe complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Pfizer\u2019s dose-optimization studies of once-daily formulations of danuglipron met key pharmacokinetic objectives and confirmed a formulation and dose with the potential to deliver a competitive efficacy and tolerability profile in Phase 3 testing, based on earlier studies of twice-daily danuglipron. While the overall frequency of liver enzyme elevations across the over 1,400 participant safety database of danuglipron is in-line with approved agents in the class, a single asymptomatic participant in one of the dose-optimization studies experienced potential drug-induced liver injury which resolved after discontinuation of danuglipron. After a review of the totality of information, including all clinical data generated to date for danuglipron and recent input from regulators, Pfizer has decided to discontinue development of the molecule.\n\u201cCardiovascular and metabolic diseases including obesity remain important areas of unmet medical need, and we plan to continue applying our global capabilities to advance a pipeline of investigational treatments that have the potential to fill critical gaps in patient care, including continued development of our oral GIPR antagonist candidate and other earlier obesity programs,\u201d said Chris Boshoff, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Research and Development at Pfizer. \u201cWhile we are disappointed to discontinue the development of danuglipron, we remain committed to evaluating and advancing promising programs in an effort to bring innovative new medicines to patients.\u201d\nLIMITED REACTION:Commenting on the news, Morgan Stanley says that its sense is that investor expectations for Danu were low. With Pfizer shares trading at a greater than 7% dividend yield, which could offer support for the stock, the firm expects \u201ca limited reaction\u201d in the shares to the discontinuation news. Morgan Stanley keeps an Equal Weight rating and $31 price target on Pfizer shares. The firm also notes that it expects initial Phase 3 data for Eli Lilly\u2019s Orforglipron this quarter representing the next key catalyst for the oral GLP-1 category.\nMOSTLY POSITIVE:JPMorgan says Pfizer\u2019s decision to discontinue development of danuglipron, an oral small molecule GLP-1, due to a liver toxicity issue in one patient, is \u201cmostly a positive\u201d for Structure Therapeutics and Viking Therapeutics. Structure is now in line to become the second small molecule oral to enter the market and Viking becomes an \u201ceven more attractive partnership candidate,\u201d the firm tells investors in a research note. JPMorgan believes Structure shares could be modestly up, to 5%, as a result of Pfizer\u2019s update.\nPRICE ACTION:In Monday morning trading, shares of Pfizer are up modestly at $22.17, while Viking\u2019s shares have jumped about 10% to $24.43 and Structure has rallied almost 11% to $17.77.\nPublished first onTheFly\u2013 the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.Try Now>>\nSee today\u2019s best-performing stocks on TipRanks >>\nRead More on PFE:\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue\nJPMorgan says Pfizer news \u2018mostly a positive\u2019 for Structure, Viking\nViking, Structure rally after Pfizer halts obesity drug development\nMorgan Stanley sees \u2018limited reaction\u2019 in Pfizer shares to oral GLP-1 scrapping\nPfizer\u2019s Danuglipron Discontinuation: Limited Impact on Stock Despite Hold Rating\nPfizer Stock (PFE) Dips after Weight-Loss Pill Halted Over Liver Injury\nWe recently published a list of Biotech Stocks Dominate Monday\u2019s Top 10 Gainers.

In the meantime,Exxon Mobil CorporationXOM has already offered an early glimpse of how the quarter might have shaped up. As oil and natural gas prices were buoyant in the March quarter, we expectBP plcBP andSLBSLB to beat on first-quarter earnings.\nPer the data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (\u201cEIA\u201d), the average Cushing, OK WTI spot prices for January, February, and March of this year were $75.74, $71.53 and $68.24 per barrel, respectively. Thus, the overall pricing environment was favorable in the first quarter of 2025, as the breakeven costs of the exploration and production companies in the shale plays are significantly lower.\nHowever, although crude prices were advantageous in the March quarter of this year, the overall prices of the commodity were a bit higher at $74.15, $77.25 and $81.28 per barrel in January, February and March of 2024, respectively. Hence, the oil-energy sector is likely to have generated lower total earnings in the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the prior-year quarter.\nOur data suggests that in the March quarter of 2025, the sector will probably generate total earnings of $27.5 billion, lower than $30.5 billion in the first quarter of 2024.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNotably, the pricing scenario for natural gas was not only healthier but also favorable in the first quarter of 2025.\nSince the prices of both crude oil and natural gas were favorable for exploration and production activities, upstream energy players will likely report handsome first-quarter results. Oilfield service players will also likely remain in the sweet spot since they help upstream firms set up oil and gas wells effectively.\nXOM, one of the largest integrated energy players, recently reported in an SEC filing that it expects its upstream earnings for the March quarter to increase sequentially by as much as $800 million. The company attributed advantageous oil and gas prices for the improvement. Moreover, ExxonMobil expects its Energy Products business unit to witness a sequential improvement of $300-$700 million owing to the changes in industry margins.\nWith the existence of a number of players in the sector, finding the right energy stocks that have the potential to beat on earnings can be daunting. Our proprietary methodology, however, makes it fairly simple.\nYou could narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), and a positive\u00a0Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our\u00a0Earnings ESP Filter. You can seethe complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nSLB\nSLB is a leading oilfield service player. As exploration and production activities were favorable, SLB is likely to have witnessed increased demand for its well construction, completions and reservoir characterization activities.\nSLB currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and a Zacks Rank of 3. It is slated to report first-quarter 2025 results on April 25.\nThe company's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 1.78%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBP\nBP, a British energy giant, currently has an Earnings ESP of +9.14% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. Supportive commodity prices are likely to have aided BP. The company is slated to report first-quarter 2025 results on April 29.\nHowever, BP expects its production from upstream operations to be lower sequentially. BP\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters and missed in the other two, delivering an average negative surprise of 3.04%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We also see Q1 earnings results continue to ramp up, but we won\u2019t have the spigots open completely til next week. Pre-markets are down somewhat, following a +3/4-percent gain on the Dow and the S&P 500, +2/3-percent gain for the Nasdaq.\nHeadlineImport Pricesfor last month have arrived, marking the first monthly negative since September of last year: -0.1%. This is down from the +0.1% estimate and the prior two months up +0.4%. Subtracting volatile fuel prices, an \u201cunched\u201d headline, 0.0%, is down -30 basis points (bps) from estimates and the previous month\u2019s headline.Year over year, Import Prices reached +0.9%, 60 bps lower than the +1.5% anticipated by analysts and 110 bps lower month over month, from February. Keep in mind, this pricing was all conducted under the specter of a new tariff regime conditioning markets. It\u2019s tough to know exactly how these numbers reflect this directly, but we expect to look back a few months and see clearly where tariff policy took hold.Exportsfor March were also \u201cunched\u201d month over month, but still +2.4% year over year. This is now the third straight month with Exports at or above +2% \u2014 the strongest such trend since the end of 2022, and again likely reflecting methods of exporters getting ahead of April tariffs. We do not expect such benign levels when these metrics report a month from now.\nThe latestEmpire Statesurvey, tracking New York state manufacturing for the month of April, posted a negative headline number, -8.1, which was an improvement from the -10.0 estimate and -20.0 reported for March, which was the lowest performance rate since a year-ago January. The last positive Empire State headline was January of this year: +5.7.\nBank of AmericaBAC is the latest of the big Wall Street commercial banks to report Q1 earnings, and the company posted its 11th-straight earnings beat: earnings of 90 cents per share outpaced the Zacks consensus of 81 cents by +11%. Revenues of $27.37 billion in the quarter surpassed expectations by +1.89%. Shares are up +2% in early trading, working down some of the -16% loss year to date.

However, an unchanged earnings per share (EPS) guide for the full year is pulling shares down -1.5% in the news, after having grown +6% year to date.

Instagram was 20 people and they paid a billion dollars for it and everybody thought they were crazy. So, um, that was a very interesting time. You know, it's interesting, the government has framed this as the, um, that Meta bought Instagram and WhatsApp in order to eliminate competition and because of that, that those products have become worse for consumers than they could have been and that the actual market is actually uh the personal social networking, which is among friends. Meta, on the other hand has a different version or a different view of what the market is and what they were doing. They said it was strategic, those products have become better, they still remain free and that the market is actually much bigger. Friends actually are a very small part of what these apps do and what the market is and the market is actually much broader in terms of competition with companies like TikTok and, uh, and X, and YouTube and those provide the real competitive marketplace. So it's interesting that we're also looking at these transactions not only what what they were thinking then, that's not only Meta, but also what the US government was thinking then, but what they what has actually happened since then, 10 years, over 10 years is a very long time.\nMhm. Well, it's interesting Moselle because you mentioned TikTok, X, YouTube, all competition, but given how similar to the end consumer that those platforms look to some of the meta platforms, is that argument going to be enough that that competition still exists outside of meta?\nWell, I think that it it it is pretty real, you know, one of the things that that I I have found interesting in the framing yesterday is that, um, the FTC says that the market uh, uh is actually smaller uh than it really is, that if you look at the broader market, Meta only controls sev 30% of that market. You have all these other companies out there and I think if you look at it from an advertising space, most advertisers view that market is the larger market.

Although liver enzyme elevations in the enrolled patients were generally consistent with other approved drugs in the same class, one patient experienced a potential case of drug-induced liver injury, which resolved after stopping treatment with danuglipron.\nAfter reviewing all clinical data and considering regulatory feedback, Pfizer concluded that halting the program was the best course of action. This decision reverted Pfizer\u2019s developmental program for an obesity candidate back to the early clinical stages and has significantly delayed its hopes for marketing an obesity drug that would compete with Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy for market share.\nHowever, PFE shares have not slid despite the setback, which likely reflects positive investor expectations regarding Pfizer\u2019s ability to bounce back from its current predicament. Pfizer plans to continue the development of its oral GIPR antagonist candidate, PF-07976016, which is currently in mid-stage development and other early-stage obesity programs. Pfizer could also in-license rights to a late-stage obesity candidate from other biotechs for developing and commercialization.\nInterestingly, Jefferies reduced Pfizer\u2019s price target from $34 to $32 following the setback, but maintained its BUY rating for the stock.\nNovo Nordisk\u00a0and\u00a0Eli Lilly\u00a0currently dominate the obesity market on the back of the tremendous success of their GLP-1 injections.\u00a0Lilly markets its dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, tirzepatide, as Zepbound for obesity, while Novo Nordisk markets its semaglutide drug as Wegovy injection for weight management.\nYear to date, shares of PFE, LLY and NVO have lost 16.6%, 2.3% and 23.2%, respectively, compared with the industry\u2019s 4.9% decline.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPfizer\u2019s setback eliminates an imminent contender for LLY and NVO\u2019s market share in the obesity space. Both firms have been raking in substantial revenues from the sale of their respective obesity injections. In 2024, Zepbound sales amounted to $4.9 billion, while Wegovy sales recorded $8.4 billion during the same time frame, both representing a substantial increase over their previous year's figures.\nShares of Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Viking Therapeutics and Structure Therapeutics rose as Pfizer's decision to discontinue its obesity pill program removes a key competitor from the market. Lilly and Novo Nordisk are also developing oral pills for treating obesity. Oral drugs are easier to use compared to injections, which can improve patient compliance. NVO is developing its oral obesity pill, amycretin, in a mid-stage study while Lilly\u2019s oral obesity pill, orforglipron, is currently undergoing phase III development.\nViking Therapeutics and Structure Therapeutics also have oral obesity candidates in their pipeline in mid-stage development.\nYear to date, shares of VKTX and GPCR have plunged 38.9% and 30.1%, respectively, compared with the industry\u2019s 6.4% decline.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nVKTX is currently evaluating the safety and efficacy of the oral formulation of its experimental obesity drug, VK2735, in a mid-stage study. Last month, the company reported completing enrollment in the phase II VENTURE-Oral Dosing study of the candidate for the obesity indication. Data from this study is expected in the second half of 2025.\nVKTX also plans to start a late-stage study on the subcutaneous version of VK2735 by the first half of this year.\nOn the other hand, Structure Therapeutics is conducting multiple mid-stage studies on its lead candidate, aleniglipron(GSBR-1290), a highly selective oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, for treating healthy overweight or obese individuals.\nThe rapid advancements being made by Viking Therapeutics and Structure Therapeutics in the development of their respective oral obesity treatment candidates have made them lucrative targets for collaboration or M&A deals.\nWhile Pfizer, Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and\u00a0 Structure Therapeutics currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each, Viking Therapeutics has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present.\nYou can seethe complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nHalliburton (HAL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 22, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nThis provider of drilling services to oil and gas operators is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -21.1%.\nRevenues are expected to be $5.26 billion, down 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nFor Halliburton, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.03%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Halliburton will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Halliburton would post earnings of $0.70 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.70, delivering no surprise.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nHalliburton doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The investment makes Elliott one of the company\u2019s top five shareholders, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Elliott\u2019s exact intentions at HPE couldn\u2019t be immediately learned.\nShares in HPE jumped as much as 8.8% on Tuesday morning after the Bloomberg News report. The stock is still down about 29% this year, giving the company a market value of roughly $20 billion.\nElliott\u2019s move is one of the first major activist campaigns unveiled after the market turmoil related to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff plans.\nRepresentatives for Elliott and HPE declined to comment.\nWhile artificial intelligence has fueled heavy demand for hardware such as servers and networking, HPE hasn\u2019t been able to seize the moment as much as its peers including Dell Technologies Inc.\nIn March, HPE said its profit this year would be sharply lower than analyst estimates as it grapples with tariffs, weak margins on server sales and execution issues. It also said it would eliminate about 3,000 jobs. Woo Jin Ho, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said at the time that the company\u2019s actions suggested \u201cmeaningful inefficiencies.\u201d Deutsche Bank AG analysts described the firm\u2019s first-quarter results as \u201cdisappointing.\u201d\nHPE could navigate the burden of tariffs since it\u2019s one of the server and storage companies that adhere to the US-Mexico-Canada agreement that replaced NAFTA, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\nTrack Record\nElliott has a successful track record in technology, having pushed for changes at Salesforce Inc., SAP SE and Citrix Systems Inc. among others. It took Citrix private in a $13 billion deal with Vista Equity Partners in 2022. Salesforce implemented growth plans to avoid a proxy fight, while SAP replaced its chief executive officer within six months of Elliott\u2019s position becoming public.\nElliott was also a longtime investor in Dell, one of HPE\u2019s major competitors. Dell\u2019s shares have jumped almost 300% since its return to public trading in 2018, outperforming HPE.\nThe activist\u2019s move comes as data center giants such as Microsoft Corp. have pulled back on projects around the world, while Chinese rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. warned of a potential bubble forming in AI data center construction.\nHPE, which split from printer and PC maker HP Inc. in 2015, has been run by Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri for the past seven years. Top managers at Crown Castle Inc. and Johnson Controls International Plc lost their jobs after fights with the hedge fund.\nHPE has been a serial dealmaker. Its predecessor company bought Aruba Networks in 2015 for about $3 billion. HPE itself acquired Nimble Storage in 2017 and supercomputer company Cray Inc. in 2019.\nBut its largest deal to date is the pending $14 billion takeover of Juniper Networks Inc., a company that Elliott had targeted more than a decade ago. The acquisition, announced in early 2024, has been in limbo after the US Justice Department sued to block it over antitrust concerns. A trial date for the antitrust lawsuit has been set for July.\n--With assistance from Brody Ford.\n(Updates HPE\u2019s share moves in third paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM\u2019s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump\u2019s America\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump\u2019s Tariff Obsession\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise stock has struggled since the technology company posted disappointing fiscal first-quarter earnings.\nDell and HP have been highlighted in this Industry Outlook article.\nDespite the impact of dynamic shifts in the regulatory landscape for the Zacks Medical - Generic Drugs industry, new product launches should provide some respite to RDY, SDZNY and TEVA.\nCompanies In The Article Are:PLTR, INTC, DELL,GS\nIn the most recent trading session, Costco (COST) closed at $979.31, indicating a +1.65% shift from the previous trading day.\nThe International Monetary Fund disbursed on Tuesday the first installment of Argentina's new $20 billion loan program after President Javier Milei removed most of Argentina\u2019s strict capital and currency controls.  For years, the restrictions had set the official exchange rate and barred companies and individuals from moving money freely.  After clinching the IMF deal last week, Milei felt confident enough to take the gamble of dismantling controls as he seeks to steer the nation\u2019s notoriously volatile economy toward the revival that he promises will follow the pain of austerity.\n(Reuters) -Hedge fund Elliott Investment Management has built a stake of more than $1.5 billion in Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.  Elliott, one of the world's biggest activist investors, now ranks among the information technology company's biggest investors and plans to engage with management, said the person who was not permitted to discuss the campaign publicly.

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)opened the pharmaceutical earnings season on Tuesdayby boosting its full-year sales forecast after posting stronger-than-expected first-quarter results. The announcement comes as the industry prepares for potential tariff shifts under the Trump administration.\nThe New Jersey-based company reported adjusted earnings of $2.77 per share, beating estimates by $0.19. Revenue came in at $21.9 billion, roughly 2% higher than a year ago and ahead of the $21.57 billion analyst forecast.\nJNJ's pharmaceutical division drove the upside, generating $13.9 billion in revenue, surpassing the $13.4 billion consensus. Key products included Darzalex, which brought in $3.2 billion a 20% year-over-year increase and Xarelto, which generated $690 million, 33% above last year. Meanwhile, sales of Stelara declined 34% to $1.6 billion as generics enter the market, and Invega Sustenna dropped 15% to $903 million.\nMedTech performance was mixed. Cardiovascular sales climbed 16% to $2.1 billion, while orthopedics and electrophysiology posted modest declines.\nDespite some pressure from product-specific declines, Johnson & Johnson raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $91.0 billion and $91.8 billion. The company attributed the change in part to the addition of Caplyta following its acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies.\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus.\nJohnson & Johnson forecasts about $400 million in costs this year related to tariffs on medical devices, said Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk in an interview.  Wolk said the estimated costs represent a \"worst-case scenario\" and take into account President Trump\u2019s 90-day pause, China's retaliatory tariffs and the resumption of the U.S. tariffs.

BofA said in January that it expected to drive between $14.5 billion and $14.6 billion of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the first quarter."

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nIt's not an easy matter to make predictions about the stock market, since no one really knows what it will do from day to day or even year to year. (Over long periods, though, it has always gone up.)\nStill, I'm here to make a prediction, and I'm predicting that three stocks in particular will be worth more thanCostco Wholesale(COST-0.21%)a decade from now. Here's a look at those companies -- and at Costco too.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nFirst off, why am Ifocusing on Costco? Don't I like it? Well, I do, and I'm a longtime shareholder. But arguably, the stock price has gottenahead of itselfat recent levels. Costco's forward-lookingprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, for example, was recently 50, well above its five-year average of 39. Its recentprice-to-sales ratiowas 1.53, above the five-year average of 1.08.\nWith 903 locations worldwide (623 in the U.S. and Puerto Rico) and a recent market value of $428 billion, it may be hard for Costco to grow at a rapid clip. Also, if a widely feared recession happens, maybe Costco will see some customers let their$65-per-year membershipslapse, as they fear spending too much at visits to Costco. (Costco does have lots of great prices, but it can be hard to not spend a lot there.)\nCostco has averaged annual gains of around 20% over the past 10 and 15 years. Let's be a little conservative and estimate a 12% growth rate for the coming decade. That would put its market value at $1.3 trillion in a decade.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM0.99%)is a giant amongsemiconductor companies.\u00a0 While most only design chips, Taiwan Semiconductor actually manufactures them. It's the biggest chip maker by far -- with a recent market share of 67%.\nThere's a lot to like about the company, such as itsapparent joint venturewith U.S.-basedIntel. As there's pressure to make more chips in the U.S., this could benefit both companies. Taiwan Semiconductor has always planned to invest more than $100 billion in U.S.-based plants.Appleislikely to be a major customerof Taiwan Semi's U.S.-built chips. Meanwhile, the company is getting a tailwind from the proliferation ofartificial intelligence(AI), as it requires more and better chips.\nThe company's stock seemsreasonably pricedat recent levels. Shares have grown in value at an average annual rate of around 20% over the past 10 and 15 years. If they grow by just 10%, that will take the market value from a recent $823 billion to $2.1 trillion.\nGoogle parentAlphabet(GOOG-1.81%)(GOOGL-1.78%)is another likely company to be worth more than Costco in a decade. That may not be a surprise, because it'salreadyworth more, with a recent market value of $1.9 trillion. Thus, even if there is a big recession, Alphabet is likely to remain bigger. Better still,it's undervalued, with a recent forward P/E of 16.3 -- well below the five-year average of 22.5. (That's partly due to a recent disappointing earnings report coupled withambitious spending plans.)\nBut generous spending plans, if executed well, can lead to further growth, and many still havegreat expectations for Alphabet-- whichowns little enterprises such as YouTube, Nest, and more.There are worriesabout the government breaking up the company, but there's also its growing AI technology, its forays into healthcare, its robust YouTube business, and perhaps even self-driving taxis.\nTencent Holdings(TCEHY-0.41%)isn't a household name, but it's a major enterprise in China, with a recent market value of $513 billion. To out-value Costco in a decade, it will only need to increase in value by a factor of around 2.5 -- or an average annual gain of around 10%. Its performance has been volatile over the past decade, but it has averaged annual gains of 11%. Better still, its stock appears quite undervalued now, with a recent forward P/E of 2.1, well below the five-year average of 7.5.\nMy colleague Billy Duberstein has dubbed Tencent \"arguablyChina's best technology company,\" adding:\nItowns WeChat, China's dominant 1.39 billion-user social media network; is China's leading mobile game publisher; ownsfintechleader TenPay; and is the country's leading video and music streaming platforms. In addition, Tencent is one of China's leadingcloud software companies, and is building its own artificial intelligence (AI) large language model, called HunYuan.\nThe current trade war with China introduces uncertainty into the picture, but Tencent is a powerful conglomerate with many tentacles, and it's been growing. For example, video game revenue rose 23% year over year in the last quarter, and the company's dividend payout was hiked by 32%.\nI may well end up being wrong about these predictions, but these three companies seem poised to overtake Costco's value in a decade. (That doesn't mean I plan to sell out of Costco, though, as I plan to remain a long-term shareholder of it.)

On Monday, the stock\u2019s closing price of $316.07 was above its 50-day moving average of $305.19 and the 200-day moving average of $288.64.Despite the market volatility and cautious sentiment due to macroeconomic uncertainty, including tariff concerns and potential recession risks, investors have been optimistic about McDonald's. The company has been gaining from internal efforts focused on its Accelerating the Arches plan, introducing menu items, offering better value deals and expanding its presence across the global markets.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nOver the past three months, MCD shares have gained 13% compared the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry\u2019s 0.6% rise. Over the same period, the stock has fared better than the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s 6.9% dip and the S&P 500 index\u2019s 9.3% decline.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe MCD stock has outperformed some industry players in the past three months, includingRestaurant Brands International Inc.QSR,The Wendy's CompanyWEN andChipotle Mexican GrillCMG. In the said time frame, shares of Restaurant Brands have gained 4.2%, while Wendy's and Chipotle have tumbled 12.6% and 14%, respectively.Can McDonald's recent performance signal a continued upward trajectory? Let us explore the key factors that can drive the stock's growth and strengthen investor confidence in the near term.\nMCD is focused on expanding its global presence, aiming to enhance growth through the latest openings and upgrades to existing locations. This strategy supports the company\u2019s continued performance despite challenging conditions. In 2024, McDonald's opened 2,116 restaurants, an increase from 2,067 in 2023. This growth reflects the company\u2019s focus on expanding its global footprint through the Restaurant Development pillar of its Accelerating the Arches Strategy.Going forward, McDonald's aims to accelerate its pace of restaurant openings to meet growing demand across key markets. In 2025, the company plans to open 2,200 restaurants globally, contributing more than 4% to new unit growth, net of closures. It continues to build on its industry-leading development, targeting 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027, marking the fastest growth phase in its history.\nMcDonald's continues to strengthen its brand by enhancing core menu offerings and improving customer experience. With a focus on value, variety and operational efficiency, the company is working to boost customer engagement and drive long-term growth. In January 2025, MCD launched the McValue platform in the United States, designed to provide customers with more flexible options and consistent value.MCD is enhancing its delivery services to provide greater convenience and improve the customer experience. With an emphasis on expanding delivery options and strengthening digital capabilities, the company is focused on creating seamless ways for customers to access its offerings.Over the past year, the delivery sales mix has doubled in Australia, Canada and the United States. McDonald's expects to increase the percentage of system-wide delivery sales originating from its mobile app to 30% by 2027.\nMcDonald's is leveraging its loyalty program and digital initiatives to drive customer retention and expand its base. By enhancing the customer experience across multiple channels, the company is creating more value for loyalty members and increasing engagement through innovative digital solutions.Since launching its loyalty program, MCD has seen significant growth, with more than 170 million 90-day active users. In 2024, sales to loyalty members reached $30 billion. With the continued rise in digital adoption, McDonald's is optimistic about the long-term success of its loyalty program. The company expects to expand its active user base to 250 million and achieve $45 billion in annual sales by 2027.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAnalysts are becoming more optimistic about MCD\u2019s earnings outlook. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for McDonald's 2025 EPS has increased from $12.23 to $12.25, implying a 4.5% year-over-year increase. The momentum is set to continue into 2026, with earnings anticipated to climb 8.2% year over year to $13.25 per share.\nMcDonald's is currently valued at a premium compared with its industry on a forward 12-month price-to-earnings basis. The company\u2019s forward 12-month P/E ratio stands at 25.21X, slightly higher than the industry\u2019s average of 25.12X. The premium valuation reflects the company\u2019s consistent performance, strong position in key markets and earnings growth potential. Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands, Wendy's and Chipotle are trading at P/E ratios of 16.61X, 12.83X, and 36.81X, respectively.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGiven MCD's strong global expansion strategy, focus on menu innovation and digital initiatives, the company is well-positioned for continued growth. Restaurant openings, digital enhancements and the successful loyalty program show promising long-term prospects.However, the company is facing challenges with weaker comparable store sales growth, as global comps edged down 0.1% in 2024 against 9% growth in the prior year. Additionally, macroeconomic uncertainty and market volatility could weigh on short-term performance.Considering McDonald's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), investors may want to stay cautious while monitoring the company's ability to capitalize on its growth opportunities in the coming quarters.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades:\nUBS upgradedHubSpot(HUBS)to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $675, down from $775. The firm cites valuation for the upgrade with the shares down 35% since mid-February\nBarclays upgradedAutoliv(ALV)to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $97, down from $110. With the firm's recommendations shifting to a more defensive positioning, it believes Autoliv can relatively outperform the sector.\nHSBC upgradedKKR(KKR)to Buy from Hold with a price target of $119, down from $170. The firm says that despite heightened macro uncertainty, it sees opportunities.\nNeedham upgradedNeurocrine(NBIX)to Buy from Hold with a $138 price target. The firm cites its positive physician survey on Crenessity's ramp in congenital adrenal hyperplasia for the upgrade.\nBofA upgradedDuPont(DD)to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $75, down from $88. While the firm does see earnings risks to DuPont from trade disruptions, it views the near 30% pullback in the shares in the last two months as excessive. BofA also upgraded Westlake(WLK)to Buy from Neutral.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nBarclays downgradedGeneral Motors(GM)to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $40, down from $70. The downgrade of GM reflects the company's \"significant risk\" to near-term earnings from tariffs.\nBofA downgradedPepsiCo(PEP)to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $155, down from $185. Frito-Lay North America's growth is likely to remain below long-term trendline this year and while international segments are scaling and making large contributions to sales and profit growth, it's not enough at this point to make up for slower growth at the North American snacks segment, the firm tells investors.\nBarclays downgradedMobileye(MBLY)to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $14, down from $22. The downgrade of Mobileye reflects its thesis that auto tech is at risk of a slower uptake.\nBaird downgradedUniversal Health(UHS)to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $224, down from $274. The firm sees minimal incremental buyers of stocks in the managed care and healthcare facilities group until the policy overhang clears.

The firm cut estimates across the aerospace group, as it thinks a global economic slowdown hits both original equipment makers and the aftermarket. Wells also downgraded Hexcel(HXL)to Equal Weight from Overweight.\nTop 5 Initiations:\nBerenberg initiated coverage ofNike(NKE)with a Hold rating and $58 price target. Within sporting goods, the firm favors incumbents over \"challenger brands\" given their \"deep\" franchise values which underpin the long-term sustainability of returns.\nBenchmark initiated coverage ofMercadoLibre(MELI)with a Buy rating and $2,500 price target. MercadoLibre \"stands out as a dominant regional leader in the global e-commerce setting,\" says the firm.\nPiper Sandler initiated coverage ofRxSight(RXST)with a Neutral rating and $18 price target. The firm likes the company's novel light adjustable lens technology and that it plays in the \"massive\" innovative intraocular lens marketplace, but is taking a \"wait-and-see approach.\"\nCiti reinstated coverage ofOmnicom(OMC)and Interpublic Group(IPG)with Buy ratings and price targets of $103 and $35, respectively. U.S. tariffs will likely hurt U.S. advertising spending, but the firm finds both stocks \"very compelling\" even with the tariff impact.\nNeedham initiated coverage ofAurora Innovation(AUR)with a Buy rating and $10 price target. The firm says the company is positioned to leverage its Aurora Driver platform and industry partnerships to create the market for autonomous trucking on U.S. highways.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Nike (NYSE: NKE) are down over 20% year to date at the time of this writing, significantly underperforming the S&P 500\u00a0and Nasdaq Composite, which are also down significantly.  China is a key market for Apple -- both from a manufacturing and a sales perspective.  After Apple stock surged on April 9 in response to a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs to all countries except China, it sank 4% the following day on news that the tariff rate on Chinese goods would be raised to a staggering 145%.\nWe recently published a list of Goldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other undervalued energy stocks.\nOn March 18, Tortoise Capital senior portfolio manager Rob Thummel appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk on the Street\u2019 to discuss his outlook on the energy sector. He believes that natural gas is positioned to lead growth in the future within the energy sector. This natural gas demand is driven by electricity and energy exports. Thummel noted that the energy and tech sectors are converging due to advancements like AI and data centers. Electricity demand fuels natural gas consumption, while US energy exports help meet global needs for low-cost and low-carbon energy.\u00a0He also highlighted that the US is now emerging as the largest exporter of LNG, even though it was an LNG importer just years ago. He anticipates that the US LNG exports will soon 2x in volume over time. Thummel also expects Europe and other countries to prioritize energy security and diversify their supply sources. This will ensure reliance on US energy exports.\nThummel emphasized a focus on energy infrastructure companies while discussing his specific investment strategies as they tend to be stable and have high dividend yields even in uncertain market conditions. He thinks that the certainty provided by energy infrastructure investments in an otherwise volatile market should not be neglected. Such companies generate substantial annual cash flows while maintaining disciplined financial practices.\nThummel thinks that the energy sector trades at a discount to historical valuations despite its fundamentals. This offers the potential for high returns.\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top energy stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15 as of April 10. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

The banking giant continues to benefit from its fortress-like balance sheet and global diversification, making it well-positioned to navigate any economic environment.\nThat was the message from CEO Jamie Dimon presenting the bank's first-quarter earnings report (for the period ended March 31). JPMorgan topped Wall Street estimates, with revenue climbing 8% year over year, while earnings per share (EPS) of $5.07 was up 14% from the prior-year quarter.\nYet the results arrived with a tone of caution. Jamie Dimon also said the U.S. economy faces \"considerable turbulence\" amid the looming impact of tradetariffsbeing implemented by the Trump administration.\nLet's discuss what tariffs and a trade war might mean for JPMorgan and its stock price outlook now.\nJPMorgan started the fiscal 2025 year off strongly, with all three of its business segments delivering revenue growth.\nThe flagship Commercial & Investment Bank group saw excellent momentum, driven by optimism about the economic outlook at the beginning of the year and record market levels that propelled trading activity and deal-making. In the Consumer & Community Banking division, card services and auto lending have been growth drivers, reflecting resilient consumer spending. Asset & Wealth Management has also been a bright spot as continued net inflows boosted fee income.\nSome of the key financial metrics that stood out in the first quarter include a 2% year-over-year increase in average loans and deposits, while JPMorgan's book value per share rose 12% compared to Q1 2024, reaching $119.24.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor\u2019stotal average return is800%\u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now\u2026\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nAlthough it may have been business as usual for the bank in the first quarter, the outlook has grown increasingly uncertain. Officially, the bank is guiding for full-year net interest income of $94.5 billion, a 1% increase from last year. However, this number isn't etched in stone, since it depends on the rapidly changing macroeconomic environment. For now, the escalating trade tensions present an operational and financial headwind.\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration announced a major U.S. trade policy overhaul, implementing a 10% baseline tariff on most imports, with significantly steeper tariffs on specific countries like China. Although Trump has since rolled back some steps, pausing higher reciprocal tariffs for 90 days for most countries and allowing for some exceptions, experts warn that the measures may still cause economic disruptions. JPMorgan's chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli now estimates a 50% recession probability, indicating that the bank is taking the risks seriously.\nWhile it's too early to fully assess the effects of the tariffs, the widespread market confusion as companies across all sectors adjust to the new environment has several implications for JPMorgan's outlook.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThere are already indications that mergers and acquisitions have stalled, with dealmakers taking a wait-and-see approach. Companies are likely to reassess hiring plans or push back on major capital investments. For JPMorgan, this means a potential slowdown in its core investment banking business and commercial lending.\nIf a recession does materialize, the consumer banking side of the business would be particularly hard-hit, as loan defaults rise, adding to credit losses. Even with some areas of the bank, such as trading, possibly benefiting from the market volatility across equities and fixed income to offset declines in fees elsewhere, the risk to earnings is tilted to the downside.\nAll this is happening while shares of JPMorgan don't necessarily stand out as a great bargain. Across multiple metrics including the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.6 and price-to-book (P/B) value of 2.0, JPMorgan continues to trade at a premium relative to its average valuation multiples over the past five years. One interpretation is that if conditions deteriorate, the stock has room to fall further.\nJPM PE Ratiodata byYCharts.\nAmongbank stocks, few rival JPMorgan's strong fundamentals and disciplined capital management, offering shareholders a source of portfolio stability even in a severe economic downturn. A swift de-escalation of trade tensions through clearer policies or negotiations could catalyze a stock rebound. For now, I'm not convinced shares are a buy, and a cautious wait-and-see approach remains prudent.\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisorservice hasmore than quadrupledthe performance of the S&P 500 since its inception in 2002*, and the analyst team knowswhen to double down.

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nThe latest monthly report from OPEC shows that the cartel has revised its global oil demand growth forecast for 2025 downward for the first time since December, now projecting an increase of 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) \u2014 150,000 bpd less than previous estimates. The revision stems largely from slower-than-expected consumption and new U.S. tariffs that have rattled trade dynamics and economic sentiment globally. As President Trump ramps up tariff measures, including a 125% levy on Chinese imports, investors are growing increasingly wary about how this might dampen energy demand, particularly in emerging markets.Despite these geopolitical headwinds, oil prices remain relatively steady, with WTI crude hovering over $60 per barrel. However, volatility is high. Crude futures are down more than 10% so far this month, largely on fears that slowing global trade and rising supply will pressure prices. Against this backdrop, it may be wise for investors to adopt a more defensive approach\u2014one that focuses on large, resilient players likeChevronCVX,ConocoPhillipsCOP, andEOG ResourcesEOG. These companies have the scale, balance sheets, and capital discipline to navigate turbulence, making them safer bets in uncertain times.\nOPEC\u2019s cautious tone isn\u2019t just based on oil-specific fundamentals. The group\u2019s Monthly Oil Market Report also trimmed its global economic growth outlook for 2025 to 3.0%, from 3.1%, reflecting growing uncertainty in light of the ongoing trade tensions. The U.S. economy is forecasted to expand by 2.1% in 2025, while growth in the Eurozone and China is expected to slow to 0.8% and 4.6%, respectively. These projections imply weaker industrial activity and transport fuel demand\u2014the key drivers of global oil consumption.OECD nations are forecast to contribute a mere 40,000 bpd to demand growth in 2025, while non-OECD countries, traditionally the growth engine, are expected to add around 1.25 million bpd. However, these numbers could fall if trade tensions and inflation continue to hurt energy use by consumers and businesses.\nOn the supply front, OPEC\u2019s report showed that the broader OPEC+ group reduced output slightly in March, with total production falling by 37,000 bpd to 41.02 million bpd. Cuts from Nigeria and Iraq offset gains from Kazakhstan, which continues to exceed its output cap. However, OPEC+ is scheduled to increase output again in May, raising questions about how the additional barrels will be absorbed in a softer demand environment.Meanwhile, non-OPEC supply growth has also been revised down. OPEC now expects non-OPEC+ liquids production to rise by 900,000 bpd in 2025\u2014100,000 bpd less than previously forecast. Most of this increase is still expected to come from the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. However, with U.S. shale growth slowing and cost inflation a growing concern, the global supply outlook looks slightly more balanced than a month ago.\nThe near-term outlook for oil is shaped by two opposing forces: weak demand growth weighed down by economic uncertainty and trade friction, versus constrained supply growth and OPEC+ discipline. While the trade war has clouded investor sentiment, the fundamentals don\u2019t suggest a collapse. Air travel demand remains solid, road mobility is recovering, and oil use is still expected to grow, albeit at a slower pace.Moreover, OPEC\u2019s view remains more optimistic than other forecasters. While Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have cut their demand forecasts sharply, OPEC still sees long-term demand trending higher, unlike the Paris-headquartered International Energy Agency (IEA), which anticipates a peak within the decade.For investors, the takeaway is clear: volatility is here to stay. But energy is still a vital part of the global economy, and demand isn\u2019t going away\u2014it\u2019s just shifting. That\u2019s why it\u2019s smart to stick with strong, stable companies that generate solid cash flow.\nWith tariffs roiling markets and macro uncertainty clouding short-term outlooks, it\u2019s prudent to hold on to proven, cash-generating energy stocks. Companies like Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and EOG Resources offer resilience and upside potential once the market regains clarity.OPEC\u2019s latest report may signal a slower pace of demand growth, but it also confirms that oil is still very much a necessary commodity. In times like these, investors should stay patient, avoid chasing volatility, and lean on the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) names best equipped to ride out the storm.You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Chevron:Chevron is well-run and historically a profitable big oil giant. Chevron\u2019s upstream portfolio remains a key strength, with strong production growth from the Permian Basin and Kazakhstan. The company is targeting a 6% annual production increase through 2026, with high-margin projects driving long-term value. Chevron continues to be a strong dividend player, having increased its payout for 37 consecutive years. The latest dividend hike of 4.9% takes its yield to over 4%, making it a reliable income source for long-term investors.ConocoPhillips:Based on production and reserves, ConocoPhillips is among the leading upstream energy players in the United States. In 2024, COP produced a record 1,987 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day globally, thanks to its strong presence in the prolific low-cost resources in the U.S. Lower 48 and Alaska, along with Asia, Australia, Africa, Europe and Canada. ConocoPhillips, with a debt-to-capitalization of 27.3%, is also demonstrating its strong financials and is well-positioned to navigate the tariff-induced market uncertainty.EOG Resources:In the United States, EOG is among the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. As of year-end 2024, the firm reported total net proved developed reserves of 2,566 million barrels of oil equivalent. Despite the decline in oil prices, EOG\u2019s operations in low-cost resources like the Delaware Basin, a sub-basin of the broader Permian and Eagle Ford shale play, are still profitable. EOG Resources also has a strong balance sheet that the upstream player can rely on to ride the current uncertain business environment. Notably, EOG Resources\u2019 low debt-to-capitalization of 13.9% is considerably below the industry\u2019s 51.4%.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this construction equipment company have returned -13%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Manufacturing - Construction and Mining industry, which Caterpillar falls in, has lost 12%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCaterpillar is expected to post earnings of $4.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.9%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.41 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -11.4%. This estimate has changed -1.7% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.69 indicates a change of +11.7% from what Caterpillar is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Caterpillar.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Caterpillar, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.61 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -7.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $62.51 billion and $65.47 billion estimates indicate -3.6% and +4.7% changes, respectively.\nCaterpillar reported revenues of $16.22 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5%. EPS of $5.14 for the same period compares with $5.23 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.64 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.57%. The EPS surprise was +3.42%.\nOver the last four quarters, Caterpillar surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCaterpillar is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Caterpillar.

The Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has lost 5.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends.

Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.9%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.03 indicates a change of +11.5% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago.

Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $93.5 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $404.46 billion and $431.42 billion estimates indicate +3.4% and +6.7% changes, respectively.\nApple reported revenues of $124.3 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4%. EPS of $2.40 for the same period compares with $2.18 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $124 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.24%.

Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that \u201cwhat gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things\u201d. Buffett\u2019sBerkshirepicks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.\nOverall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio. So, let\u2019s take a look at the top Goldman Sachs value stocks.\nA happy couple viewing the products of this household and personal product company in a mass merchandiser store.\nTo compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm\u2019s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs\u2019 stake value.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nGoldman Sachs' Q4 2024 Stake Value: $2,830,956,468\nP/E Ratio as of April 11: 25.26\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 79\nAmerican multinational consumer goods corporation, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), ranks 5th on our list of the best Goldman Sachs value stocks. On March 26, Evercore ISI maintained an Outperform rating on PG with a $180 price target.

This can potentially expand consumer access and innovation, leading to consistent volume share gains in the United States and important international markets.\nOn April 8, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) declared a $1.0568 per share quarterly dividend, a 5% increase from its prior dividend of $1.0065. The dividend is distributable on May 15, to shareholders on record as of April 21.

Earnings per share came in at $1.88, a 34% year-over-year increase. The company returned $4.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. PG is sticking to its 2025 guidance, expecting 10-12% EPS growth and 5-7% core EPS growth. However, the company acknowledged some headwinds, including $500 million from higher costs and weaker currency exchange rates. Procter & Gamble plans to return up to $17 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during fiscal 2025.\nAmong the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was part of 79 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q4 2024, compared to 68 funds in the prior quarter.

Investors with a high-risk appetite should pick these funds. Small-cap funds generally invest in companies with a market cap lower than $2 billion. The companies, though smaller in size, offer growth potential and their market capitalization may increase subsequently.\nMeanwhile, value stocks tend to trade at a price lower than their fundamentals (i.e., earnings, book value, debt-equity). It is common for some investors to consider value funds for income or yield. However, not all value funds consist solely of companies that primarily use their earnings to pay dividends. Investors interested in choosing value funds for yield should make sure to check the mutual fund yield. The mutual fund yield is dividend payments divided by the value of the mutual fund\u2019s shares.\nBelow, we share with you three small-cap value mutual funds, namely,DFA U.S. Targeted Value PortfolioDFFVX,Putnam Small Cap ValuePSLAX andGoldman Sachs Small Cap Value InsightsGSATX.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill.Alphabet (GOOGL)earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.08 a share, just nine days from its upcoming earnings release on April 24, 2025.\nGOOGL has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.02%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.08 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.04.\nGOOGL is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure.Monolithic Power (MPWR)is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\nSlated to report earnings on May 7, 2025, Monolithic Power holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $4.01 a share 22 days from its next quarterly update.\nMonolithic Power's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.29% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, GOOGL and MPWR could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this social media company have returned -12.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Meta Platforms belongs, has lost 9.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.22 per share, indicating a change of +10.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.9% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $24.85 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4.2%. This estimate has changed -3% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.90 indicates a change of +12.3% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.3%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $41.27 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.2%. The $186.33 billion and $210.86 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.3% and +13.2%, respectively.\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $48.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +20.6%. EPS of $8.02 for the same period compares with $5.33 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $46.97 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.02%. The EPS surprise was +20.06%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Adding to the challenges, wine producers around the world are under threat from tariffs for sales into the United States, the world's largest importer of wine by value.

Chili\u2019s says in a press release that its version has 85% more beef, making it \u201ceven more value-packed\u201d than the fast food classic.\nThe Big QP is being added to Chili\u2019s popular \u201c3 for Me,\u201d a $10.99 meal that includes the burger, fries, unlimited chips and free refills of a soft drink. The deal exploded in popularity last year when Chili\u2019s took aim at customers of its fast food rivals (notably McDonald\u2019s)  who might be turned off by theirrising prices.\nAnd while the meal might be more expensive than a McDonald\u2019s Quarter Pounder, which costs around $5 to $7 depending on the city, it\u2019s comparable in price to a combo meal with medium fries and medium-sized soft drink.\nChili\u2019s directly jabbed McDonald\u2019s in its press release, calling the $10.99 deal \u201cless expensive than a comparable meal at McDonald\u2019s\u201d as well as releasing TV ads that call the Quarter Pounder \u201ctiny.\u201d\nThe Big QP is the second McDonald\u2019s-inspired burger from Chili\u2019s. Last year, the chain added a Big Mac-like burger called the Big Smasher, rolling out acheeky ad campaignthat directlycalled out the Big Mac. Ultimately, that proved a successful gambit, with the Big Smasher helping Chili\u2019s register a 15% jump in same-store sales following its release.\nChili\u2019s is likely hoping to sustain its skyrocketing sales by continuing this rivalry. Sales in its most recent quarter jumped 31%, marking the chain\u2019s third-straight quarter of double-digit growth. Shares of Brinker International (EAT), its parent company, have soared 200% over the past year.\nRelated articleChili\u2019s and Applebee\u2019s are fighting about their value meals\nOnce trailing flashier rivals, Chili\u2019s ispulling off its comebackthanks to these deals, plus revamped chicken tender recipes and viral TikToks of its \u201cTriple Dipper\u201d appetizer. The chain also recently opened a location in Scranton, Pennsylvaniainspired by \u201cThe Office.\u201d\nThis success stands in contrast to most casual dining chains. Typically catering to lower and middle-income families looking for a sit-down meal, diners have been abandoning these companies in recent years.These restaurantshave been hiking menu prices at the same time their customer base is being squeezed by the rising cost of living, resulting in several bankruptcies, including Hooters, TGI Fridays and Buca di Beppo.\nAlthough McDonald\u2019s hasn\u2019t directly responded to Chili\u2019s, the chain recently added a\u201cMcValue\u201d menu categoryin hopes of turning around its sluggish sales. In addition to the$5 meal deal, the menu also has a \u201cBuy One, Add One for $1\u201d option and more locally targeted promotions from its franchises.\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +0.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which JPMorgan Chase & Co. falls in, has lost 4.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is expected to post earnings of $4.44 per share, indicating a change of +0.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.3% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.06 points to a change of -8.6% from the prior year.

(NYSE:HD) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in.\nAs we recentlydiscussedin another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that \u201cwhat gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things\u201d.

Wolk said the estimated costs represent a \"worst-case scenario\" and take into account President Trump\u2019s 90-day pause, China's retaliatory tariffs and the resumption of the U.S. tariffs.  J&J isn't doing anything differently yet in response to tariffs, Wolk added.\nThe headline numbers for Bank of America (BAC) give insight into how the company performed in the quarter ended March 2025, but it may be worthwhile to compare some of its key metrics to Wall Street estimates and the year-ago actuals.\nWhile the top- and bottom-line numbers for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) give a sense of how the business performed in the quarter ended March 2025, it could be worth looking at how some of its key metrics compare to Wall Street estimates and year-ago values.\nGriffon and Cars.com's have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day\nShares of major U.S. banks are surging Tuesday, after Bank of America and Citigroup became the latest lenders to report better-than-expected quarterly earnings on the back of a stock trading boom.\nJohnson & Johnson stock fell alongside the broader market, despite beating first-quarter calls and hiking its 2025 sales guidance.\n\ud83d\udd0e Boeing (BA): Beijing ordered Chinese airlines not to place new orders for Boeing jets and is requiring carriers to seek approval before taking delivery of aircraft they have already ordered. \ud83d\udd0e Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): The healthcare company raised its 2025 sales guidance, but held its earnings outlook.\nLVMH\u2019s latest sales figures show Chinese and U.S. demand for luxury goods was wobbly\u2014even before the trade war between the two countries kicked off in earnest.

The pullback meant LVMH lost its crown as Europe\u2019s most valuable luxury company to Herm\u00e8s, which reports later this week.\nBank of America and Citigroup said consumer spending ticked higher in the first quarter, when concerns about the economy began to bubble up.\nCitigroup, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, reported Tuesday that profit in the first quarter was $4.1 billion, up 21% from a year ago. That amounted to per-share earnings of $1.96, which topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations for $1."

Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that \u201cwhat gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things\u201d. Buffett\u2019sBerkshirepicks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.\nOverall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio. So, let\u2019s take a look at the top Goldman Sachs value stocks.\nA closeup of a technician controlling a power generation facility.\nTo compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm\u2019s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11.

This included requirements to preinstall Google Search and Chrome, along with placing their icons on the default home screen. Manufacturers were reportedly also restricted from altering Chrome's default search settings.\nAdditionally, the commission alleged Google provided financial incentives to manufacturers, offering ad revenue shares in return for not preloading competing search services.

The bank added around 250,000 new consumer checking accounts, marking its 25th straight quarter of growth, and logged 4 billion digital logins, with 65% of sales now digitally enabled.\nStill, CEO Brian Moynihan struck a cautious tone, noting that \u201cwe potentially face a changing economy in the future.\u201d\nCitigroup posted first-quarter 2025 net income of $4.1 billion, or $1.96 per share, on $21.6 billion in revenue \u2014 a 3% increase from a year ago. Growth was broad-based across all five core businesses, with standout performances in the Markets and Wealth divisions.\nU.S. personal banking revenue rose 2% to $5.2 billion, powered by gains in Branded Cards and Retail Banking, though partially offset by a drop in retail services. Net interest income climbed 6%, fueled by loan growth in branded cards and wider deposit spreads in its retail banking.\nJohnson & Johnson beat Wall Street expectations in the first quarter, reporting adjusted earnings per share of $2.77 on revenue of $21.89 billion. Sales of cancer drug Darzalex jumped 20% year-over-year to $3.24 billion, helping drive 4.2% growth in the company\u2019s Innovative Medicine segment.\nThe healthcare giant raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $91.6 billion and $92.4 billion, reflecting the impact of its Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition and the addition of Caplyta, a treatment for bipolar depression. However, adjusted EPS guidance held steady at $10.50 to $10.70 as the company factors in tariffs, deal-related costs, and currency headwinds.\nJ&J also moved to reverse $7 billion previously set aside for talc-related legal settlements, after courts rejected its bankruptcy-based strategy for resolving lawsuits over its discontinued baby powder. The company maintains the claims are without merit and says it will defend them in state courts.\nIn tech news, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday as the Federal Trade Commission resumed its antitrust trial against the company, zeroing in on claims that Meta cemented its dominance by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp.\nThe FTC argues the deals were part of a \u201cbuy or bury\u201d strategy to crush competition, and it wants Meta to divest both platforms. Zuckerberg pushed back, insisting the acquisitions benefited consumers and that Meta still faces intense pressure from rivals like TikTok and YouTube (GOOGL).\nThe outcome of the trial \u2014 set to run through July \u2014 could reshape not just Meta\u2019s empire, but who gets to decide what \u201ccompetition\u201d really means in the platform era.\nFor the latest news,Facebook,TwitterandInstagram.\nCiti analyst Ronald Josey cut his price target on Meta, Amazon, Reddit and more stocks because of concerns over a potential slowdown in ad spending.\nBrian Thompson\u2019s murder has raised questions about the cost of U.S. healthcare, embroiling insurers, drugmakers and PBMs in a battle for the future of the industry.\nBecause of this, Social Security is a topic that may have flown under your radar.  Years back, lawmakers voted to make Social Security benefits eligible for an automatic cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) that's tied to inflation.  As such, 2025's Social Security COLA was not as generous as recent ones.\nWe recently published a list of Goldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in. As we recently discussed in another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at [\u2026]\nCitigroup (C) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of 6.52% and 1.95%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 2025. Do the numbers hold clues to what lies ahead for the stock?\nJohnson & Johnson forecasts about $400 million in costs this year related to tariffs on medical devices, said Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk in an interview.  Wolk said the estimated costs represent a \"worst-case scenario\" and take into account President Trump\u2019s 90-day pause, China's retaliatory tariffs and the resumption of the U.S. tariffs.  J&J isn't doing anything differently yet in response to tariffs, Wolk added.\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) lifted its full-year operational and reported sales outlook on Tuesday as th\nWhile the top- and bottom-line numbers for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) give a sense of how the business performed in the quarter ended March 2025, it could be worth looking at how some of its key metrics compare to Wall Street estimates and year-ago values.\nIt could change social media as we know it.\nLVMH\u2019s latest sales figures show Chinese and U.S. demand for luxury goods was wobbly\u2014even before the trade war between the two countries kicked off in earnest.  Shares in Louis Vuitton's owner sank Tuesday, after the company said sales fell 3% over the three months through March compared with a year earlier.  The pullback meant LVMH lost its crown as Europe\u2019s most valuable luxury company to Herm\u00e8s, which reports later this week."

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nConsider buying these top-notch AI-powered stocks in the current market dip.\nThe global equity markets are highly volatile these days, triggered mainly by ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and trade wars.Artificial intelligence(AI) stocks are also suffering, with many seeing significant corrections in valuations. Yet the long-term growth story of several of these AI-powered stocks, especially those with scalable cutting-edge technologies, is intact.\nInvestors can benefit from this market uncertainty by picking small stakes in high-quality, fundamentally strong AI stocks with sustainable competitive advantages, such asMeta Platforms(META-1.88%),Broadcom(AVGO0.32%), andPalantir Technologies(PLTR6.27%). Here's why buying and holding these stocks over the next decade can be a smart move for retail investors.\nMeta Platforms' extensive user base exceeds 3.3 billion daily active users across its Family of Apps -- including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Messenger -- granting it unmatched dominance in the global digital advertising landscape.\nMeta's massive user base gives it access to vast amounts of personalized data. The company analyzes this data with advanced AI algorithms to improve content recommendations on its social media platforms, which helps boost user engagement. This translates into improved ad targeting and higher return on investment for advertisers on its platforms. As more relevant content and products become available on Meta's platforms, it attracts even more customers. This strong network effect results in a sticky user base and an advertiser base for Meta.\nMeta developed a multifaceted AI strategy, which includes investing in AI applications, AI models, and AI infrastructure. The company's personalized AI assistant, Meta AI, reaches 700 million monthly users. The company also focuses on developing an open-source Llama model series -- an initiative to help draw developers and enterprises to its ecosystem. Meta also planned for $60 billion to $65 billion capital expenditures in 2025, of which a significant portion is for expanding data center capacity.\nYet Meta trades at only 22.3 times earnings, below its five-year historical average of 25.3 times. Meanwhile, RBC Capital analysts estimate that the company's earnings will grow annually by 15% to 20% over the long term once Meta has completed its current investments in AI initiatives.\nAgainst this backdrop, the current valuation retreat offers an attractive entry point into a company poised to benefit from AI's long-term growth potential in the coming decades.\nSemiconductor giant Broadcom also transformed itself into an AI powerhouse by focusing on developing custom AI-optimized accelerators (XPUs) for hyperscaler AI workloads. The company offers the next-generation networking infrastructure required for large-scale deployments of AI clusters. Broadcom's acquisition of VMware is highly successful, with 70% of the largest 10,000 customers adopting the VMware Cloud Foundation platform to create virtualized data centers and on-premises private cloud environments.\nThanks to the robust hardware-software ecosystem, the company's AI business is thriving, with revenues surging 77% year over year to $4.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending Feb. 2, 2025).\nThe strong AI momentum can continue in the coming years. Management anticipates a serviceable addressable market (SAM) of $60 billion to $90 billion solely from its three major hyperscaler clients by 2027. The company also has four more hyperscalers in the early engagement stage -- which can potentially expand the SAM even more in the coming years.\nDespite its robust AI business and impressive SAM, Broadcom is trading at 27.8 times forward earnings, far lower than its historical five-year average of 70.7 times. The company's valuation multiples can improve in coming years, considering that analysts expect Broadcom's earnings to grow annually by 26.6% in the long run.\nInvestors can use the current share price pullback as an attractive entry point in this solid growth stock.\nData analytics and mining company Palantir offers AI-powered tools and infrastructure to government and commercial clients. Its software analyzes enormous amounts of information across data types and sources to create actionable insights. Palantir's proprietary ontology system (digital frameworks that help relate real-world and digital assets) separates the company from many other AI software companies. Since building robust ontology frameworks takes enormous time and investment, this has become a significant competitive moat for Palantir.\nWith various software solutions, including Gotham, Foundry, and the newly launched Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), the company has effectively established itself as the ontology and AI-powered operating system for the modern enterprise.\nAIP has also become a significant growth catalyst for the company. Instead of focusing on developing better models, AIP is helping clients deploy AI applications to resolve real-world problems.\nPalantir's stock is currently down nearly 30% from its all-time high in February 2025. Several factors led to this downfall, including cuts in defense spending, CEO Alex Karp selling an almost $1.9 billion stake since early 2024, and high macroeconomic uncertainty triggered by the U.S. government's tariff policies.\nDespite this, Palantir stock trades at 161.3 times forward earnings, which is undoubtedly rich. However, growth stocks often trade at very high valuation levels for long time frames. With analysts projecting long-term revenue and earnings growth of 21.4% and 27.7%, respectively, the valuation will also eventually become more reasonable.\nDespite its contentious valuation, Palantir can prove to be a brilliant addition to an AI-focused investment portfolio -- giving you solid exposure to an enterprise AI software business.\nBefore you buy stock inMeta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 andMeta Platformswasn\u2019t one of them.

It adds to economic uncertainty, with market experts offering cautious economic forecasts. According to EY, the euro area will experience a modest economic turnaround in 2025, and growth is expected to increase from 0.7% last year to 1.3% and 1.8% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. It is forecasted to simmer down to 1.4% in 2027. Among all European countries, Malta is projected to experience the highest GDP growth in 2025 at 4%. EY expects soft employment growth across Europe, driven by demographic challenges and subdued labor demand. Unemployment will likely remain at 2024 levels. While nominal wage this year will clock in higher than pre-pandemic levels, wage growth will take a hit. Central and Eastern European countries are forecasted to experience relatively higher inflation in 2025, while the overall rate remains just over 2% in the euro area.\nMeanwhile, German economic institutes have slashed their growth projections for 2025 to 0.1% from the previous forecast of 0.8% in September 2024. This revised estimate does not incorporate the recent tariffs levied by the US. These tariffs will be a major setback for European economies, possibly toppling them over the edge of recession for the third consecutive year. The new conservative government declared a \u20ac500 billion fund to improve infrastructure and defence and stimulate growth. The fiscal package enhances the economic outlook for 2026 and 2027.\nHowever, as the United States is feeling the pressure from high valuations and growing political instability, analysts are looking towards Europe as a better bet for stock investors. Analysts point towards Europe offering a more stable outlook, with lower stock prices, clearer policy direction, and even potential interest rate cuts on the horizon. Investors seem to be shifting their focus, partly because the threat of US tariffs on Europe, especially on automobiles, feels less uncertain now that details are clearer. There is also less exposure to tech in Europe, which is seen as a good thing right now. Europe\u2019s markets, with just 10% tech exposure in the Europe 600 compared to 30% in the broader market, look more balanced.\nWith solid earnings, rising share buybacks, and cheaper stock valuations, investors are turning to Europe. Experts suggest that European and UK markets now have their best shot in years at outperforming the US. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the best-performing stocks in Europe so far in 2025.\nA woman pouring a freshly made beverage from a large-scale bottling line.\nTo compile our list of the top performing European stocks this year, used the Finviz screener, applying filters for the region and a market cap of over 10 billion to identify stable European companies. Next, we applied a performance filter and selected 11 European stocks with the highest YTD share price growth as of April 11. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 24\nYTD Share Price Performance as of April 11: 13.13%\nCoca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (NASDAQ:CCEP) is a UK-based company that manufactures, bottles, and distributes soft drinks, energy drinks, water, juices, tea, and coffee, featuring popular brands like Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Monster, Schweppes, and Minute Maid. CCEP ranks 10th on our list of the best performing stocks in Europe.\nOn April 8, Bernstein maintained a Market Perform rating on Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (NASDAQ:CCEP) and lifted the price target to $84.5 from $82, citing strong fundamentals and consistent dividends.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other undervalued energy stocks.\nOn March 18, Tortoise Capital senior portfolio manager Rob Thummel appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk on the Street\u2019 to discuss his outlook on the energy sector. He believes that natural gas is positioned to lead growth in the future within the energy sector. This natural gas demand is driven by electricity and energy exports. Thummel noted that the energy and tech sectors are converging due to advancements like AI and data centers. Electricity demand fuels natural gas consumption, while US energy exports help meet global needs for low-cost and low-carbon energy.\u00a0He also highlighted that the US is now emerging as the largest exporter of LNG, even though it was an LNG importer just years ago. He anticipates that the US LNG exports will soon 2x in volume over time. Thummel also expects Europe and other countries to prioritize energy security and diversify their supply sources. This will ensure reliance on US energy exports.\nThummel emphasized a focus on energy infrastructure companies while discussing his specific investment strategies as they tend to be stable and have high dividend yields even in uncertain market conditions. He thinks that the certainty provided by energy infrastructure investments in an otherwise volatile market should not be neglected. Such companies generate substantial annual cash flows while maintaining disciplined financial practices.\nThummel thinks that the energy sector trades at a discount to historical valuations despite its fundamentals. This offers the potential for high returns.\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top energy stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15 as of April 10. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nAn aerial view of an oil rig at sea, the sun glinting off its structure.\nForward P/E Ratio as of April 10: 12.92\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) engages in integrated energy and chemicals operations and operates in the Upstream and Downstream segments. The Upstream segment explores, develops, and produces crude oil and natural gas. The Downstream segment refines crude oil into petroleum products, markets crude oil, refined products, & lubricants, and manufactures & markets renewable fuels.\nIn 2024, the company\u2019s Permian Basin operations exceeded expectations with production growth of about 18% compared to the year-ago period, which was another record for Permian production. Over the past 5 years, the company has delivered a CAGR of 16% in the Permian, which has been achieved through optimized pad and drilling designs, as well as completion improvements such as triple frac techniques.\nThis allows the company to reach these production levels with 40% fewer company-operated rigs than previously planned. Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) now expects Permian production to reach one million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025. The Permian portfolio delivers superior returns due to royalty-advantaged acreage across all sub-basins, which contributes to both the top and bottom lines.\nOverall, CVXranks 3rdon our list of the best undervalued energy stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of CVX, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

The iPhone maker reported first-quarter adjusted earnings of $2.40 per share, beating analyst estimates of $2.36 per share.\nApple shares have nosedived since the announcement of \u2018Liberation Day' tariffs on April 2, sparking investor panic over potential supply chain disruptions and weakening sales in China.\nHowever, the stock staged a dramatic rebound on Wednesday, closing with a gain of over 15%, after PresidentDonald Trumpannounced a 90-day pause on tariffs for countries that have not retaliated against U.S. trade actions.\nCheck out thisarticle by Benzingafor Apple\u2019s latest options trends.\nTrending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\"Here\u2019s how you can earn passive income with just $100.\nIf you want to make $100 per month \u2014 $1,200 annually \u2014 from Apple dividends, your investment value needs to be approximately $240,000, which is around 1,207 shares at $198.85 each.\nUnderstanding the dividend yield calculations:When making an estimate, you need two key variables \u2014 the desired annual income ($1,200) and the dividend yield (0.50% in this case). So, $1,200 / 0.005 = $240,000 to generate an income of $100 per month.\nYou can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the current price of the stock.\nThe dividend yield can change over time. This is the outcome of fluctuating stock prices and dividend payments on a rolling basis.\nSee Also: The secret weapon in billionaire investor portfolios that you almost certainly don't own yet.See which asset class has outpaced the S&P 500 (1995-2024) \u2013 and with near-zero correlation.\nFor instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2/$50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2/$40).\nIn summary, income-focused investors may find Apple stock an attractive option for making a steady income of $100 per month by owning 1,207 shares of stock. There may be more upside to come as investors benefit from the company's consistent dividend hikes.

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nSuited in variations of blue, Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday to defend his company\u2019s past\u2014and fight for its future.\nThe CEO of Meta, Zuckerberg has helmed the company that began as Facebook for more than 20 years. Over the last decade, he\u2019s had to defend his business in Washington, D.C. plenty of times before, from the 2018 Cambridge Analytica hearings to the 2021 Congressional hearings focused on disinformation.\nBut arguably, these are the highest stakes Zuckerberg has faced so far, because what\u2019s on trial is fundamental: The composition of his sprawling, $1.35 trillion market cap business.\nThe FTC has sued Meta, arguing that the social media giant\u2019s acquisitions ofInstagramand WhatsApp more than a decade ago were anti-competitive tactics to eliminate rivals. If Meta loses the case, it could be forced to divest the two apps. The case, which has its roots in the first Trump administration and was carried on by Biden FTC Chair Lina Khan, has travelled a long and winding docket (it was initially dismissed and then refiled) to finally make it to trial\u2014with Zuckerberg as the first witness.\nWhile FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson argued that \u201cconsumers do not have reasonable alternatives\u201d to Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, Zuckerberg made the case that Meta\u2019s market is far bigger (and more competitive) than the government suggests. On the stand, Zuckerberg dismissed the idea that Facebook was centered on friends, and said that the company had become \u201cmore of a broad discovery and entertainment space.\u201d\nThis case, of course, is far bigger than Meta. On some level, it\u2019s existential for the tech landscape as a whole\u2014at least, when it comes to how the industry currently operates. Whether or not the FTC\u2019s claims about Meta\u2019s anticompetitive motives are correct, the underlying business practice\u2014a tech giant swallowing up an innovative startup\u2014is the way the tech ecosystem has been structured to function, and to reward its various participants, over the past several decades.\nFor startups, especially those with limited IPO prospects, dreams of a Big Tech exit have been dim for the last several years\u2014and under the Trump administration, investors and entrepreneurs have been eagerly waiting for M&A to roar back to life.\nThere is some evidence that has been happening\u2014take, for example, Google\u2019s blowoutacquisition of Wiz for $32 billion, announced in March and the largest deal in the search giant\u2019s history. And some in Meta\u2019s camp are no doubt holding out hope that Trump will step in and pressure the FTC to settle the case with Zuckerberg (Meta hascertainly been lobbying the President).\nBut the reality is this: If Meta loses this trial, the Big Tech dealmaking that was beginning to thaw is very likely to freeze back over, affecting the whole ecosystem. For startups, the hopes of exiting to a tech giant will appear grimmer, andliquidity-starved VCswill continue to see exits stall while LPs grow increasingly impatient for returns.\nAgain, none of this is to excuse or condone the monopolistic market concentration that may have been created over time. But given the incentives that are currently built into tech, it does remain natural for giants to look for innovation by acquiring startups.\nZuckerberg is expected to take the stand again on Tuesday, and when he does, he won\u2019t just be making the case for his company. He\u2019ll be making the case for Big Tech M&A being allowed to return to its longstanding modus operandi\u2014for better, or for worse.\nFreeze...The Trump administrationsaid yesterdaythat it's frozen about $2.2 billion in federal funds for Harvard, amid a standoff over demands sent by the government last week.

On April 14, the company told investors it would scrap development of danuglipron, its oral GLP-1 candidate for weight management. The stock has been trading about 63% below its all-time high.\nPfizer's stock price is way down, but the quarterly dividend it pays has risen for 16 consecutive years. At its beaten-down price, the stock offers an eye-popping 7.8% yield.\nIf Pfizer continues its dividend-raising streak, investors who buy at recent prices could realize market-beating gains over the long run. Let's look a little closer at danuglipron, plus some bigger problems the company faces, to see if this stock could be a smart buy on the dip.\nThe end of Pfizer's danuglipron program highlights just how risky the drug-development process can be. According to the company, it discontinued development after just one patient in a dose-optimization study experienced a liver injury that could have been caused by the experimental GLP-1 pill.\nThe danuglipron program's termination is disappointing, but it won't be the end of Pfizer's attempt to developblockbusterweight-management drugs. The company has an oral glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) antagonist in phase 2 trials. Investors will probably hear more about this candidate, tentatively named PF-07976016, down the road.\nA disappointing outcome for a weight-management candidate isn't anywhere near the top of Pfizer's list of problems. Investors should be far more concerned with an upcoming loss of patent-protected market exclusivity for Eliquis. Sales of the oral blood thinner it markets in partnership withBristol-Myers Squibbrose to $7.4 billion, or 11.6% of total revenue last year.\nEliquis is expected to lose patent-protected exclusivity in 2026, although generic competition in the U.S. market isn't expected to begin until 2028. Pfizer's second-largest revenue stream in 2024 could also start drying up soon. The Prevnar family of vaccines was responsible for over 10% of total sales last year. Prevnar 13 is expected to lose patent-protected exclusivity in the U.S. next year.\nVyndaqel has been a strong growth driver for Pfizer but probably not for much longer. This treatment prevents heart damage caused by transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis and grew sales by 64% to reach $5.4 billion last year.Bridge BioandAlnylamare now marketing competing treatments for the limited population of TTR amyloidosis patients with heart damage. In addition to competing treatments, Vyndaqel is expected to face generic competition in the U.S. in 2028.\nDrug developers need to communicate with regulators at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before, during, and after they run clinical trials for new drug candidates. In the U.S., many of those regulators recently lost their jobs.\nIn 2024, the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approved 50 new drugs. The CDER director, Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., stepped down in January and joined Pfizer's C-suite as chief medical officer.\nHaving the former CDER director on staff could be advantageous for Pfizer, but I'll be pleasantly surprised if the FDA completes new drug approvals at half the usual pace this year. According to reporting from STAT, more than a few FDA employees involved in the new drug approval process were among thousands recently fired from the agency.\nA crippled FDA could be a huge problem for Pfizer and its peers who must constantly launch new drugs to overcome exclusivity losses for established products.\nMany investors expect pharmaceutical industry lobbyists to prevent the Trump administration from rendering CDER incapable of reviewing new drug applications at its usual pace. They could be right, but I won't support an investment thesis that relies on industry lobbyists protecting a regulatory agency.\nIf you asked me a month ago, I would have called this stock a buy. In 2023, it earned FDA approval for nine new drugs and last year it reported over a dozen product approvals from the agency. With plenty of new products coming online, Pfizer had a good chance to overcome upcoming patent cliffs and maintain its dividend-raising streak.\nNow that the CDER has been dramatically downsized, it's probably best to assume the worst. I'll be avoiding this and all drugmaker stocks until we see proof that a much smaller FDA can continue approving new drugs at the usual pace.\nBefore you buy stock inPfizer, consider this:\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 andPfizerwasn\u2019t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) stands against other best value dividend stocks.\nDividends, though sometimes underappreciated, have significantly contributed to long-term investor gains. Between 1960 and the end of the previous year, reinvested dividends and the effects of compounding accounted for about 85% of the S&P Index\u2019s total return. Dividend-oriented strategies offer the advantage of steady income, improved portfolio stability, and a potential buffer during uncertain economic periods\u2014making them a strong choice for all-weather portfolios.\nWith ongoing tariff tensions in the US adding to market volatility, many investors have begun favoring dividend-focused approaches to strengthen their portfolios. After a stretch where growth stocks took center stage, dividend investing has started to regain traction. According to a report by Franklin Templeton, US-listed dividend ETFs recorded average monthly net inflows of nearly $3.3 billion during the six months leading up to January 31, 2025\u2014up sharply from just $107 million during the same period a year earlier.\nGiven the uncertain global environment, investors have increasingly leaned toward more reliable components to maintain portfolio balance. Dividend-paying stocks\u2014particularly those backed by strong fundamentals\u2014have emerged as a preferred option due to their ability to generate stable and predictable cash flows. Since these cash flows play a central role in equity valuation models, determining the intrinsic value of dividend stocks typically involves less uncertainty compared to valuing growth-oriented equities. As a result, such stocks are seen as a stabilizing force within a diversified investment strategy.\nAccording to analysts, the strength of dividend-paying stocks lies in their capacity to cushion portfolio losses during market downturns while still providing a meaningful upside. Historically, dividend strategies have shown defensive qualities across different regions and time periods. Data for the three-year span ending December 31, 2024, revealed that dividend stocks experienced lower volatility and smaller maximum drawdowns than the broader market in global, US, and European segments. Notably, when concerns over inflation and rising interest rates resurfaced in August, dividend stocks proved more resilient than their growth-focused counterparts.\nHistorically, income-focused investing often leans heavily toward value stocks, as investors typically look for companies offering high dividend yields and lower valuation multiples. However, a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices points out that the Dividend Aristocrats Index strikes a balance between both value and growth characteristics. Since 1999, the index has maintained an average composition of roughly 60.5% value stocks and 39.5% growth stocks, showing no consistent bias toward either investing style. Analysts maintained that a portfolio combining strong dividend yield, consistent dividend growth, and resilience in payouts should always remain relevant. They noted that even without relying on market revaluation, the combination of income and income growth could support projected nominal gross returns exceeding 10% annually.\nA specialized industrial laboratory, filled with high-tech machinery for producing abrasives.\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 proprietary database of billionaires\u2019 stock holdings and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked dividend stocks with forward P/E ratios below 20, as of April 13. The stocks are ranked according to the number of billionaires having stakes in them. Where two or more stocks were tied on billionaire sentiment, we used forward P/Es as a tiebreaker between them.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Billionaire Holders: 17\nForward P/E Ratio as of April 13: 17.42\n3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is a Minnesota-based multinational conglomerate that operates in a wide range of industries. The stock is outperforming the broader market this year, surging by nearly 5% since the start of 2025. In the past 12 months, MMM has delivered a nearly 49% return to shareholders. The rise signals growing investor confidence in CEO Bill Brown\u2019s strategy to steer the company back on track. Several challenges are already showing signs of progress, and where that\u2019s not yet the case, Brown has set plans in motion. For instance, the healthcare division was spun off into a new company called Solventum last year. In addition, 3M has reached settlements related to PFAS and combat earplugs, providing both management and shareholders with greater clarity regarding future financial obligations.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) reported revenue topping $6 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts by $157 million. The firm has recently focused on reinforcing its core business segments, with innovation continuing to play a central role. Investments in exclusive technologies and patents have helped sharpen its competitive advantage. Meanwhile, steps to boost efficiency\u2014particularly within the supply chain\u2014have led to a 70% improvement in suppliers meeting delivery timelines. The company\u2019s ability to manage regulatory issues and ongoing legal matters has also contributed to its financial resilience and investor trust. With a forward P/E ratio of 17.42, MMM is one of the best value stocks to monitor.\n3M Company (NYSE:MMM) also maintained a healthy cash flow throughout FY24, generating $1.8 billion from operations and $4.9 billion in free cash. During the year, it returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through a mix of dividends and stock buybacks. Notably, on February 4, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 4.3% to $0.73 per share\u2014the first increase since halving the payout in May of the previous year. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.15%, as of April 13.\nOverall, MMMranks 6thon our list of the best value dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of MMM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

If you\u2019re not going to recognize that the people who are central to running your business and making it successful are already diverse, if you don\u2019t help elevate them, you\u2019re going to miss the opportunity to really accelerate your business.\nI don\u2019t care as much about what\u2019s happening around [DEI].

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) stands against other best value dividend stocks.\nDividends, though sometimes underappreciated, have significantly contributed to long-term investor gains. Between 1960 and the end of the previous year, reinvested dividends and the effects of compounding accounted for about 85% of the S&P Index\u2019s total return. Dividend-oriented strategies offer the advantage of steady income, improved portfolio stability, and a potential buffer during uncertain economic periods\u2014making them a strong choice for all-weather portfolios.\nWith ongoing tariff tensions in the US adding to market volatility, many investors have begun favoring dividend-focused approaches to strengthen their portfolios. After a stretch where growth stocks took center stage, dividend investing has started to regain traction. According to a report by Franklin Templeton, US-listed dividend ETFs recorded average monthly net inflows of nearly $3.3 billion during the six months leading up to January 31, 2025\u2014up sharply from just $107 million during the same period a year earlier.\nGiven the uncertain global environment, investors have increasingly leaned toward more reliable components to maintain portfolio balance. Dividend-paying stocks\u2014particularly those backed by strong fundamentals\u2014have emerged as a preferred option due to their ability to generate stable and predictable cash flows. Since these cash flows play a central role in equity valuation models, determining the intrinsic value of dividend stocks typically involves less uncertainty compared to valuing growth-oriented equities. As a result, such stocks are seen as a stabilizing force within a diversified investment strategy.\nAccording to analysts, the strength of dividend-paying stocks lies in their capacity to cushion portfolio losses during market downturns while still providing a meaningful upside. Historically, dividend strategies have shown defensive qualities across different regions and time periods. Data for the three-year span ending December 31, 2024, revealed that dividend stocks experienced lower volatility and smaller maximum drawdowns than the broader market in global, US, and European segments. Notably, when concerns over inflation and rising interest rates resurfaced in August, dividend stocks proved more resilient than their growth-focused counterparts.\nHistorically, income-focused investing often leans heavily toward value stocks, as investors typically look for companies offering high dividend yields and lower valuation multiples. However, a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices points out that the Dividend Aristocrats Index strikes a balance between both value and growth characteristics. Since 1999, the index has maintained an average composition of roughly 60.5% value stocks and 39.5% growth stocks, showing no consistent bias toward either investing style. Analysts maintained that a portfolio combining strong dividend yield, consistent dividend growth, and resilience in payouts should always remain relevant. They noted that even without relying on market revaluation, the combination of income and income growth could support projected nominal gross returns exceeding 10% annually.\nA close-up of a financial advisor giving advice to a customer, demonstrating the importance of consumer and wealth management.\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 proprietary database of billionaires\u2019 stock holdings and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked dividend stocks with forward P/E ratios below 20, as of April 13. The stocks are ranked according to the number of billionaires having stakes in them. Where two or more stocks were tied on billionaire sentiment, we used forward P/Es as a tiebreaker between them.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NYSE:GS) reported a revenue of $13.87 billion, reflecting a 23% year-over-year increase. Over the full year, assets under supervision reached a record $3.14 trillion, up 12%.

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nGood morning. Tariff wars may cause manyApplecustomers to rethink their loyalty to avoid high prices.\n\u201cIf the 145% China tariffs came into play, we believe Apple would have no choice but to start charging $2,000-plus for iPhone Pro once inventory levels came down,\u201d Wedbush Securities analysts wrote in a note on Sunday.\nThe tech giant has developed a loyal fan base of customers willing to pay premium prices for their products, like iPhones. Product differentiation, brand equity, and perception of value are part of the company\u2019s strategy. However, research shows that increasing pricescan negativelyimpact customer loyalty. And adding exorbitant costs to Apple customers would be a dealbreaker for many, Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing director, told me.\nIves put it to me this way: \u201cIf someone charged you $7 for a slice of pizza, even the best slice of pizza, you wouldn\u2019t buy it. So everything has a price.\u201d As someone who grew up eating New York pizza, that resonated with me.\nIt seems Apple may have some breathing room before considering raising prices for U.S. customers. The Trump administration announced late Friday thatsome electronics, such as smartphones, were temporarily exempted from the 145% import tariffs on goods from China. That\u2019s some relief for Apple, a company that\u00a0assembles devices in China and imports them.\nHowever, the break could be short-lived as in asocial media poston Sunday, President Trump said \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook'\u201d while adding that the exempted products are \u201cjust moving to a different tariff \u2018bucket.\u2019\u201d\nThe impending tariffs and uncertainty could mean a change to Apple\u2019s pricing strategy, which its new CFO had no intention to alter. Apple SVP and CFO Kevan Parekh began on Jan. 1, succeeding former CFO Luca Maestri, who held the role for over 10 years. Maestri leads the corporate services teams. Parekh participated in his first earnings call on Jan. 30 regarding the quarter that ended Dec. 28. An analyst noted that one of Maestri\u2019s legacies was maintaining consistent pricing across the product range.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to really depart from what served us pretty well,\u201d Parekhsaid on the call. Apple has had a \u201cdisciplined pricing strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continually kind of stick with that as far as I can tell.\u201d\nAmid ongoing tariff uncertainty, many Apple customers areflocking to storesto make purchases before any potential price bumps. \u201cWhen you create that level of uncertainty, it causes chaos in the supply chain,\u201d Ives said.\nApple is facing a situation where CEO Tim Cook knows what is coming down the road and needs to make some adjustments, Wedbush analyst wrote in the Sunday note. \u201cCook being 10% politician and 90% CEO is an asset for Apple (and its investors) in this situation,\u201d according to the note.\nSherylEstradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com\nThis story was originally featured onFortune.com\nGoogle will require European crypto ads to follow MiCA rules, raising compliance hurdles for smaller exchanges.\nThe move will mark a shift from the company\u2019s prior exclusive reliance on synthetic data for training AI models.\nApple (AAPL) has received quite a bit of attention from Zacks.com users lately. Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.\nChip maker  Nvidia  unveiled plans Monday to produce new made-in-America supercomputers that power artificial intelligence, just one day after the Trump administration said tariffs were coming for semiconductor-reliant imports.  The chip maker said it would make AI supercomputers with contract manufacturers in Texas, its first public disclosure of a plan that would amplify ongoing U.S. efforts to bring semiconductor production back to domestic markets.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other best dividend-paying stocks.\nDividend-paying stocks have consistently attracted investor interest due to their long-term value. CNBC highlights this by examining the historical performance of the broader market. Between 1960 and 2024, a $10,000 investment in the index would have grown to over $982,000 purely from stock price appreciation, based on data from FactSet and NYU Stern. However, many companies in the index also returned capital to shareholders through dividends. Had an investor reinvested those dividends over the years, the investment would have ballooned to approximately $6.42 million by the beginning of 2025.\nThis outlook seems reasonable, especially when considering how crucial cash flow has become in today\u2019s economic environment. Investors continue to favor income-generating assets, and dividends remain one of the most reliable ways to deliver that income. Reflecting this trend, several companies within the market have recently introduced dividend payments.\nAccording to S&P Global, companies in the S&P index now contribute roughly 85% of the total dividends paid across the market\u2014up from 82% in 2024. This increase includes 2.7% of the total dividend pool coming from firms that only recently began issuing dividends. The top 29 companies in the index alone are responsible for 40% of all dividends paid by the index\u2019s constituents and 35% of the total dividends across the entire US equity market. Under the current base-case forecast, these leading firms are expected to distribute a combined $280 billion in dividends. In a more optimistic (upside) scenario, that figure could climb by 2.75% to $288 billion, with major large cap companies projected to deliver the most significant gains by weighted average. If the most favorable (bull-case) conditions materialize, these 29 companies could boost total dividend payouts by an estimated 4.5%, contributing an additional 1% themselves.\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that dividends have become a central theme in many investors\u2019 strategies. According to Brian Bollinger, founder of Simply Safe Dividends, focusing on companies that regularly pay dividends can offer a sense of reassurance. He further noted that younger investors, in particular, have the opportunity to build long-term dividend growth portfolios aimed at maximizing total return and capital appreciation over time.\nAccording to Nuveen, companies that focus on dividend growth tend to possess strong long-term fundamentals and may deliver relatively attractive performance in the year ahead. Historically, firms that consistently increased or initiated dividend payments have produced higher annualized returns and exhibited lower volatility compared to the broader equity market. While such companies may not lead in every market environment, their favorable risk-adjusted returns over extended periods make them a solid foundation for equity portfolios.\nNuveen also suggested that many firms remain in a strong position to continue raising dividends over time. In the US, corporate balance sheets are generally healthy, consumer spending remains steady, and earnings growth is projected to pick up pace in 2025. Data from FactSet shows that dividends per share for the S&P index rose by 7.6% in 2024, with consensus forecasts pointing to a further 4.2% increase in 2025.\nA senior healthcare professional giving advice to a patient in a clinic.\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of the close of Q4 2024. From the top 60 companies, we selected 11 dividend stocks with yields of at least 1% as of April 12. These companies show strong financial performance and have solid records of paying dividends.

The company has consistently paid dividends since 2010.\nOverall, UNHranks 2ndon our list of the best dividend paying stocks according to hedge funds.

Together, the big five banks on Wall Street pulled in nearly $37 billion on that front.\nAt the same time, some banks showed a slight pullback in investment banking, as companies became more cautious about new deals amid the uncertainties surrounding Trump\u2019s trade policies. Those fees at Bank of America fell 3% from the year-ago period to $1.52 billion.\nRead more:How to protect your money during economic turmoil, stock market volatility\nHowever, Citigroup reported that its investment banking fees rose 13.6% from the year-ago period to $1.1 billion.

That figure was 11% higher than a year ago and exceeded what analysts expected.\nThe stocks of Bank of America and Citigroup both rose in Tuesday morning trading.\nBank of America CFO Alastair Borthwick told reporters, \"Our research team at this point doesn't believe we'll see a recession, and our clients continue to show encouraging signs.\"\n\"Our research team are still calling for modest growth,\" he added. \"They've talked about the fact that they think that some of the uncertainty may lead to a slowdown in the economy before it picks back up, but that would be very similar to things like the blue-chip consensus at this point, and similar to what Chairman Powell has said\" \u2014 referring to Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\nBut there were signs that Bank of America expects credit conditions to worsen. It set aside $1.48 billion in credit provisions for potential future losses, more than 12% more than it set aside a year ago.\nBorthwick walked analysts through a comparison of the bank's balance sheet now as compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, a tumultuous period following a housing crash andfinancial crisisthat severely tested Bank of America and the rest of the US banking system.\nHe told analysts that Bank of America's capital base and liquidity have increased significantly since the end of 2009, and stress test results indicate significantly lower credit losses expected in a severe downturn.\nThe changes made since that time, Moynihan said, allow the bank to \"stand tall in times of stress.\"\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n(Reuters) -Bank of America topped estimates on Tuesday for first-quarter profit as interest income grew and volatile markets helped its stock traders rake in a record haul, lifting its shares more than 4%.  \"There is a lot to potentially change given the uncertainty around the tariffs and the policies on the future path of the economy,\" CEO Brian Moynihan told analysts on a call.

The costs will be felt primarily within the company's medical technology unit, which makes a range of medical devices and surgical products.  The most substantial impact comes from tariffs against China and retaliatory tariffs from China, said Joseph Wolk, Johnson & Johnson's chief financial officer, in a conference call with analysts following the company's latest earnings results.\nEven before U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs threw markets and companies into turmoil, global CEOs were already unhappy with the support they were getting from their boards of directors in navigating uncertainty, a survey showed on Monday.  Just 22% of the corporate chief executives surveyed in late 2024 by the consultancy Spencer Stuart felt their boards were providing the help they needed in an increasingly uncertain business environment, the study found.  Directors, while happier with their own performance, also saw ample room for improvement, with just 43% saying they felt boards effectively supported top managers in a \"rapidly evolving and complex\" business environment.\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand on Monday at a high-stakes trial in Washington over U.S. antitrust enforcers' claims that the company spent billions of dollars to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp to fend off Facebook competitors.  The FTC is seeking to force Meta to restructure or sell Instagram and WhatsApp, testing President Donald Trump's promises to take on Big Tech while posing an existential threat to a company that by some estimates earns about half of its U.S. advertising revenue from Instagram.  Wearing a dark suit and light blue tie, Zuckerberg calmly responded to questions while seeking to combat allegations Meta bought the companies a decade ago to eliminate competition among social media platforms where users connect with friends and family.\nJ&J faces several headwinds at the start of the year, including patent expiry, talc litigation, and, now, tariffs.\nLegal, ethical, and safety concerns can\u2019t stop this \u2018post-apocalyptic\u2019 social media trend.\nThe replacement system is launching into markets already served by repair devices, namely Edwards\u2019 Pascal and Abbott\u2019s Mitraclip."

Meanwhile,JPMorganis even more bearish. Its recession model sees a nearly 80% chance the economy goes into a recession, up from 60% not long ago.\nRecessions tend to cause corporate profits to decline, which drives many companies to cut costs through layoffs and other initiatives. Some companies will even cut or suspend theirdividend paymentsto shareholders to conserve cash.\nHowever, other companies are more recession-resistant due to the durability of their cash flows and the strength of their balance sheets.ExxonMobil(XOM-0.02%)andCoca-Cola(KO-0.69%)have proven their ability to weather recessions over the decades. They've both increased their dividends throughout at least the past four recessions. There's a good chance they can withstand the next one with similar ease.\nXOM Dividenddata byYCharts. Gray bars are recessions.\nExxonMobil hiked its dividend payment by 4% earlier this year, extending its streak to 42 years of annual payment increases. \"We're proudof the factthat we've increased our annual dividend per share for 42 years in a row, something only 4% ofS&P 500companies can claim,\" stated CFO Kathy Mikells during the oil giant's fourth-quarter earnings conference call. She continued, \"And we plan for that track record to continue for decadesto come, which is only possible by investing in the high-quality growthopportunities that drive leading returns and higher cash flows.\"\nThe energy company has been investing heavily in transforming its business to dramatically improve its underlying earnings power whilealsoexpanding into lower-carbon energy. This strategy has boosted its earnings capacity by nearly $14 billion over the past five years on a constant price and margin basis. Exxon plans to invest over $140 billion into major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program through 2030, which, along with structural cost savings, should add another $20 billion to its annual earnings capacity.\nThat incremental income will give Exxon even more fuel to grow its dividend, which is already on an incredibly safe foundation.

Meanwhile,JPMorganis even more bearish. Its recession model sees a nearly 80% chance the economy goes into a recession, up from 60% not long ago.\nRecessions tend to cause corporate profits to decline, which drives many companies to cut costs through layoffs and other initiatives. Some companies will even cut or suspend theirdividend paymentsto shareholders to conserve cash.\nHowever, other companies are more recession-resistant due to the durability of their cash flows and the strength of their balance sheets.ExxonMobil(XOM-0.03%)andCoca-Cola(KO-0.68%)have proven their ability to weather recessions over the decades. They've both increased their dividends throughout at least the past four recessions. There's a good chance they can withstand the next one with similar ease.\nXOM Dividenddata byYCharts. Gray bars are recessions.\nExxonMobil hiked its dividend payment by 4% earlier this year, extending its streak to 42 years of annual payment increases. \"We're proudof the factthat we've increased our annual dividend per share for 42 years in a row, something only 4% ofS&P 500companies can claim,\" stated CFO Kathy Mikells during the oil giant's fourth-quarter earnings conference call. She continued, \"And we plan for that track record to continue for decadesto come, which is only possible by investing in the high-quality growthopportunities that drive leading returns and higher cash flows.\"\nThe energy company has been investing heavily in transforming its business to dramatically improve its underlying earnings power whilealsoexpanding into lower-carbon energy. This strategy has boosted its earnings capacity by nearly $14 billion over the past five years on a constant price and margin basis. Exxon plans to invest over $140 billion into major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program through 2030, which, along with structural cost savings, should add another $20 billion to its annual earnings capacity.\nThat incremental income will give Exxon even more fuel to grow its dividend, which is already on an incredibly safe foundation. Last year,Exxon produced $34.4 billion in free cash flow, easily covering its $16.7 billion dividend outlay. Meanwhile, it has a fortress balance sheet with an ultra-low 6%leverage ratioand a massive $23.2 billion cash balance.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nThe last few weeks may feel like months for investors trying to make sense of huge swings to the upside and the downside in the broader market. TheNasdaq Composite's(^IXIC-0.05%)over 12% pop on April 9 pole-vaulted the index out ofbear marketterritory -- which is a decline of over 20% from a recent high. However, a subsequent sell-off on Thursday pushed the Nasdaq within striking distance of being back in a bear market.\nBear markets have historically been phenomenal times to put hard-earned savings to work in the market, but only for businesses that have the qualities necessary to endure a prolonged slowdown. Here are some risks worth considering before diving headfirst into buying the dip, and whyMeta Platforms(META-1.88%)passes the risk test.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nBear markets can happen for a variety of reasons -- such as valuation concerns, economic slowdowns, and recessions. In this case, the major risk is that tariffs will lead to higher costs, lower demand, lower spending, and a potential recession.\nCompanies that generate high free cash flow (FCF) with strong profit margins are well positioned to endure a period of higher tariffs. Meta is a perfect example.\nMeta's family of apps, which includes Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, relies on ad revenue. Ad revenue is high-margin because Meta has few operating costs besides paying employees and managing its platforms.\nThe social media giant is ramping up capital expenditures to support its artificial intelligence (AI) efforts. It is also deploying considerable capital toward research and development for its Reality Labs division, which handles augmented reality and virtual reality products like Meta Quest. But these investments aren't essential for supporting the core business.\nThe company has many levers it can pull to generate tons of FCF, even during a recession. It can reduce capital expenditures and Reality Labs spending. From a capital return perspective, it could also pull back on stock repurchases.\nIn 2024, Meta generated a staggering $54.1 billion in FCF on a revenue of $164.5 billion. The company returned the majority of that FCF to shareholders -- including through $30.1 billion in buybacks. And Meta began paying a modest dividend last year.\nAll told, Meta is raking in the FCF even as itloses money on its Reality Labs segment-- a testament to the profitability of its family of apps and Instagram's growth.\nAnother risk worth considering before buying growth stocks during a bear market is financial health. If a company's capital structure depends on debt, making interest payments and managing that debt will become more difficult if profits fall.\nSimilarly, if a company has high fixed costs and has to spend a lot of money to make money, that risk could be amplified during an economic slowdown.\nMeta Platforms isn't just a high-margin business, it also has an impeccable balance sheet. Meta closed out 2024 with $43.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $33.9 billion in marketable securities compared to just $28.8 billion in long-term debt. That means Meta has plenty of cash to navigate the cycle through long-term investments, acquisitions, etc. The company's FCF provides a cushion to buy back stock, and the balance sheet is yet another margin of error that Meta has to endure a downturn.\nAnother risk to consider is shareholder expectations. The valuation of growth stocks is determined more by future expectations than present conditions, reflecting their current high prices. If the trajectory looks sound, the market may be willing to pay a premium price for shares today. But if forecasts turn murky, investors may wait for more certainty.\nThe period of higher interest rates over the last few years has been damaging to companies that depend on debt and spending money to scale up to a level where they can turn a profit. Similarly, a prolonged period of tariffs could stunt growth trajectories, making valuations look more expensive relative to medium-term earnings expectations.\nDefining shareholder expectations for any company is an abstract exercise. But for a company like Meta, I would imagine that investors mostly just want to see steady growth and high margins from the core family of apps. The success or failure of Reality Labs probably isn't even factored into the valuation that much, given Meta trades for just 22.9 times trailing earnings and 26.5 times FCF. AI-fueled growth would be a bonus, but the company is already doing so well.\nAs for the capital return program, the dividend could become something similar to what companies likeMicrosoft,Broadcom, andOraclehave done -- which is paid and raised their dividends for15 consecutive years-- although none of these companies have high yields. The dividend, like buybacks, is just an added way to return capital to shareholders. But on its own, it doesn't make or break the investment thesis.\nMeta checks all the boxes for a beaten-down growth stock to buy during a Nasdaq bear market. The company is a high-margin cash cow coming off a record year. Should free cash flow fall temporarily, the company could still support its operating expenses by pulling back on spending and buybacks.\nThe balance sheet has a massive net cash position -- providing a cushion in case of a serious recession. Meta doesn't have to come out with a new product or live up to lofty expectations. Rather, it just has to continue driving traffic and engagement on its family of apps to attract ad spending.\nMeta's resilience to the mentioned risks offers investors a model for identifying promising investment opportunities in the current market.\nBefore you buy stock inMeta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 andMeta Platformswasn\u2019t one of them.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Bank of America Corporation BAC, Chevron Corporation CVX and Stryker Corporation SYK, as well as two micro-cap stocks Value Line, Inc. VALU and Sypris Solutions, Inc. SYPR.\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Bank of America Corporation, Chevron Corporation and Stryker Corporation, as well as two micro-cap stocks Value Line, Inc. and Sypris Solutions, Inc.The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\nYou cansee all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\nShares ofBank of Americahave gained +2.5% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry\u2019s gain of +20.4%. The company\u2019s volatile nature of the trading business is a major headwind. Despite an impressive performance since 2022, it is expected to normalize going forward. This is likely to hamper fee income growth.\nThe Zacks analyst project non-interest income to rise only 3.4% in 2025. Continued investments in the franchise will keep the company\u2019s expenses elevated. We expect total non-interest expenses to rise 3% this year. While high funding costs are still a woe, the company\u2019s net interest income (NII) will be positively impacted by higher rates for longer.\nThe Zacks analyst expects NII to record a CAGR of 5.3% over the next three years. Plans to open financial centers in new and existing markets and improve digital capabilities will aid the top line. We project total revenues to grow 4.8% in 2025.\n(You canread the full research report on Bank of America here >>>)\nChevron\u2019sshares have declined -6.2% over the past six months against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry\u2019s decline of -11.9%. The company being a fully integrated energy firm, is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin.\nFurther, the planned acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana. However, the company is grappling with high sensitivity to oil fluctuations and relatively expensive valuation.\nAnother concern is the weak margins on refined products that forced its downstream segment to its first quarterly loss in 4 years. Considering these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.\n(You canread the full research report on Chevron here >>>)\nShares ofStrykerhave gained +4.3% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Products industry\u2019s gain of +5.5%. The company is poised for growth, driven by rising demand for robotic-assisted procedures, hospital capital expenditures and international expansion. The Mako SmartRobotics platform fuels adoption, while acquisitions like Inari Medical and Vertos Medical enhance the portfolio.\nStryker is actively integrating new technologies such as AI-driven imaging and smart surgical systems to improve patient outcomes and maintain its competitive edge. Pricing improvements and a strong hospital order book support 2025 growth.\nHowever, foreign exchange volatility and acquisition-related margin pressures may impact earnings. Supply chain disruptions and rising costs could strain profitability. Intensifying competition in robotics and MedTech demands constant innovation. Macroeconomic risks, including potential downturns in healthcare spending and regulatory shifts, add uncertainty.\n(You canread the full research report on Stryker here >>>)\nValue Line\u2019sshares have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry over the past year (+10% vs. +6.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $370.23 million have robust cash generation, with cash balances rising to $27.1 million from $6.1 million YoY, enhances liquidity and supports dividends, buybacks, and growth investments. EAM Trust income surged 47.7% to $13.8 million, driven by AUM growth to $5 billion, providing a rising, diversified passive income stream.\nThe company maintains disciplined capital returns, paying $0.90/share in dividends and repurchasing shares, with $0.9 million authorization remaining. Portfolio gains doubled to $3.6 million, bolstering earnings. Strong branding and diversified offerings serve both retail and institutional clients, supporting market position.\nHowever, core publishing revenue declined to $26.7 million, and customer concentration (30% from one client) heightens risk. Operating costs and taxes rose, further pressuring margins, while limited international presence (~2% of revenues) increases vulnerability to U.S. market shifts.\n(You canread the full research report on Value Line here >>>)\nShares ofSypris Solutionshave gained +3.6% over the past year against the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry\u2019s gain of +36.3%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $36.37 million benefits from an extended long-term supply agreement with a global OEM, securing stable revenues as a sole-source supplier of Ultra Axle Shafts.\nSypris Solutions\u2019 diversified presence across automotive, energy, and industrial markets reduces risk and positions it to capitalize on growth trends in heavy-duty vehicles and energy infrastructure. Sypris Solutions is also aligned with growth in aerospace and defense electronics, leveraging its capabilities in high-precision components to meet rising demand. Expansion into the Asia-Pacific region aligns with high-growth markets, leveraging regional investments in defense and infrastructure.\nHowever, liquidity challenges constrain financial flexibility. Rising costs and reliance on cyclical markets such as heavy vehicles and oil and gas exacerbate margin sensitivity. Competitive pressures in aerospace further heighten vulnerability.\n(You canread the full research report on Sypris Solutions here >>>)\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Umpleby, a veteran who has been with the company for more than four decades, held the top job for the last eight years and guided the firm through a demand and supply chain downturn brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Umpleby, who will transition to executive chairman, will hand over the reins on May 1 to 49-year-old Joseph Creed, a 28-year veteran with extensive leadership experience at Caterpillar.\nCaterpillar has decided to make a change at the top, replacing Jim Umpleby with Joe Creed.\nRecently, Zacks.com users have been paying close attention to Caterpillar (CAT).

You might think it's a company likeMicrosoft, which has developed extensive generative AI capabilities for its popular products, orNvidia, which develops the chips that make AI technology possible.\nHowever, you might be surprised to learn that the Magnificent Seven company with the most generative AI patents is Google parent companyAlphabet(GOOGL-1.78%)(GOOG-1.81%). Based onThe Motley Fool's latest research, Alphabet has 631 different generative AI patents -- second most among U.S. companies and a far greater number than any of its big-tech counterparts.\nThis is only one metric where the company is winning the AI intellectual property race, but it gives Alphabet a competitive advantage that investors might be overlooking. Plus, Alphabet looks like a highly attractive place to put money to work for patient, long-term investors right now for a few reasons.\nWith any new and rapidly evolving technology comes a surge in patents protecting the intellectual property of companies that are engaged in its development. There are tens of thousands ofgenerative AIpatents in existence. While a few Chinese companies have the most by number, U.S. businesses generally have the more valuable patents, as indicated by how much more often they're cited in academic research.\nWhen it comes to U.S. companies, the No. 1 patent holder isIBM, which was an early AI pioneer with its Watson technology years ago. But Alphabet is in a close second position and has more than 630 patents, the majority of which are related to software AI applications (like theGoogle Geminitools).\nAs mentioned, patents alone are just one piece of the puzzle. But Alphabet's combination of high-quality generative AI patents and extremely deep pockets to invest in innovation give it a major competitive advantage. Alphabet has about $73 billion in net cash on its balance sheet, in addition to the more than $100 billion in annualized operating income the business produces.\nBeyond its patent portfolio, there's a lot to like about Alphabet right now. In the most recent quarter, the company's revenue grew by 12% year over year and its earnings per share (EPS) grew more than 30%. Throughout the business, growth was impressive and expense controls were highly effective.\nGoogle Cloud is an especially strong point, with 30% year-over-year revenue growth and a massive opportunity ahead of it. The global cloud services market is expected to roughly quadruple in size by 2032, so this should be a long-tailed, high-margin growth opportunity for the company.\nAlphabet is a rare combination of a dominant market-leading business and one that has lots of growth potential, both of which are extremely profitable. Its vast collection of intellectual property, especially when it comes to generative AI, could give it some major advantages over its peers in the coming years.\nThere still are some concerns, though, such as how Google's advertising revenue would hold up in a recession and the continuing threat of the Justice Department calling for the breakup of the company. However, with double-digit revenue growth and a valuation of just 18 times forward earnings -- the lowest of any of the Magnificent Seven, by far -- now could be a great time to take a closer look.\nBefore you buy stock inAlphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 andAlphabetwasn\u2019t one of them.

Google is improperly forcing phone makers to prioritize its apps and services on their devices in exchange for allowing them to put the app store on phones sold in Japan, the regulator said. The US company said in a statement it was disappointed with the findings and will review the order before deciding next steps.\nThe announcement comes just ahead of Economic Revitalization Minister Ryosei Akazawa\u2019s planned visit to the US this week to press for a reprieve from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Japanese products.\nThe watchdog\u2019s move also follows a complaint by the Office of the US Trade Representative that Japan\u2019s Digital Platform Act \u2014 geared to boost transparency from large technology providers \u2014 disproportionately affects American companies and undermines their competitiveness in Japan by increasing compliance costs.\nJapan\u2019s cease-and-desist order marks the country\u2019s first such command to any leading US tech firm. But it\u2019s a straggler among regulators overseas. The EU has rebuked both Google and Apple for using what it alleges are illegal tactics to dominate mobile software markets, while the US Justice Department is considering asking a federal judge to force Google to sell off parts of its business after a federal judge ruled the company illegally monopolized the search market.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like Japan is the only country that\u2019s targeted certain US companies,\u201d FTC Director General Masaru Ogo said in response to questions about how the move might affect US-Japan tariff discussions. \u201cWe don\u2019t think this will be a big problem.\u201d\nWhile the US runs a goods deficit with Japan, it has a surplus in services, which includes licensing fees for Android\u2019s app ecosystem as well as advertising revenue. Last year, the US sold more than $45 billion in seasonally adjusted services to Japan.\nGoogle allegedly capitalized on the struggles of Android smartphone makers selling handsets in Japan to retain market share in a country where Apple Inc. is by far the leading smartphone brand. Google demanded the phone makers \u2014 which include Sony Group Corp. and Sharp Corp. \u2014 bundle the Chrome browser and the Google search box widget and promote it on each handset\u2019s home screen as must-have conditions when making contracts to provide the Google Play store app, according to the FTC. The manufacturers complied, because that app ecosystem is indispensable to deliver phones that can stand toe to toe with Apple\u2019s handsets.\nMountain View, California-based Google also offered to share ad revenue with device makers if they agreed not to preload search engines from its rivals, the FTC said. Google places a high priority on ensuring it\u2019s the first search service users see when they get a new phone, paying Apple billions each year to secure that spot on iPhones.\nAs of December last year, Google had contracts with six handset makers that mandated installing the Google widget and app, the FTC said. It had inappropriate revenue share programs with four handset makers and one wireless carrier as of July 2024, it said.\nFailure on the part of Google to comply may result in fines or criminal punishment, officials said. The move gives handset makers more freedom to decide what apps to preload and provides opportunities for Google\u2019s rivals, said Saiko Nakajima, senior investigator for digital platform operators.\n\u201cThe FTC will will continue to take proactive, strict and appropriate action when it comes in contact with information that is suspected of violating the law in the digital field,\u201d Ogo said.\n--With assistance from Yoshiaki Nohara.\n(Updates with comments from Google and FTC from the second paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM\u2019s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump\u2019s America\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump\u2019s Tariff Obsession\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\nUntil excessive inequality is addressed, expect increased political violence, populism, and social unrest.\nJapan\u2019s antitrust regulator instructed Alphabet\u2019s Google to stop what it said are anticompetitive practices involving mobile search services, its first order against a U.S. technology giant.\n-BP has made an oil discovery at the Far South field in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, it said on Monday, as the energy major seeks to grow production under a strategy reset announced earlier this year.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nThe live TV streaming business is one of this year's biggest winners, but the best could be yet to come.\nNo one expectedFuboTV(FUBO3.82%)to be one of just four exchange-listed stocks withmarket capsnorth of $900 million to have doubled this year, but here we are. The live TV streaming service catering to sports fans saw its stock soar in January afterbrokering a dealwithDisney(DIS0.40%)that will eventually find the iconic media giant owning a 70% stake in the business.\nThere's a lot to like about the unlikely pairing with Disney, but it doesn't mean that the upticks are over. No matter how the future plays out, Fubo is in a better position to succeed than it was at the start of this year. Let's take a closer look at why Fubo is a stock that you should buy like there's no tomorrow.\nThe deal with Disney is still about a year away from closing as the partnership isn't expected to close until the first half of next year. The combination is tantalizing for both parties. Fubo will get an infusion of credibility, scalability, and liquidity. Disney will get to see if a less distracted company can help boost the prospects for its Hulu + Live TV offerings that is losing ground to the market leader.\nProviders of live TV streaming services -- a niche of the digital market that tries to duplicate the traditional cable or satellite television platform with enhanced features -- are still largely neglected by consumers. Just 40% of the country is still subscribing to an old-school cable or satellite TV platform, but most of the other 60% isn't hopping on the next-gen alternative.\nThere are roughly 20 million U.S. homes subscribing to a live TV streaming service, and 8 million of them belong toAlphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)YouTube TV. Fubo had just 1.7 million paid subscribers at the end of 2024, less than 10% of the market. Disney's live TV streaming platform has 4.6 million subscribers. Pairing up the two platforms would give them a fighting chance against Alphabet.\nThe good news is that these small audiences pay big money to digitally re-create the cable TV experience. Largely through subscription premiums -- but also with the ad revenue that it collects on top of that -- the average revenue per Fubo account is $87.90 a month. If you think that's high, Disney's Hulu + Live TV is taking in an average of $99.22 per subscriber.\nThe bad news is that the reason why the subscription rates are so high is that the broadcasters, networks, and channels on the platform that retain the lion's share of that keep asking for more at every renewal. Price is the main reason that the cable TV market has lost a third of its audience over the past decade. It's also why folks are gravitating to cheaper premium streaming services instead of the costly live TV bundles. Pairing up Fubo with Hulu + Live TV gives the former access to Disney's audience and ad team. Disney gets a differentiated sports-centric player than its own ESPN+. Fubo is also growing faster, with revenue rising 19% over the past year. The combination would result in synergies beyond the obvious economies of scale.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThere is always the risk that any deal could fall apart on regulatory concerns or just a change of heart by the House of Mouse. Disney is a big company, even if the combined company would still be a lot smaller than YouTube TV. This is probably good time to point out how Fubo was already makingbig steps in improving its business.\nFubo generated its first quarter of positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter. Analysts see Fubo turning profitable on an adjusted basis next year, turning that corner on a reported basis in 2027. Those same Wall Street pros see low double-digit revenue growth for Fubo in the next couple of years as a stand-alone company.\nThen we get to the consolation prizes that Fubo has scored or can collect. Fubo receives $130 million from Disney if the partnership fails to make it to the finish line next year. At the time the deal was announced, Fubo agreed to a $220 million settlement for dropping its injunction against Venu Sports, a Disney-led consortium of three sports programming giants that wanted to band together. Venu Sports folded a few days later, but Fubo is still getting $220 million now, another $130 million if it doesn't pair up with Disney next year, and access to $145 million in term loan from Disney.\nEven without the financing option, Fubo would have $350 million as a stand-alone company that it didn't have at the start of this year. Despite more than doubling this year, its market cap has only increased by less than $550 million this year. In other words, most of its year-to-date surge is already covered by its newfound cash infusion.\nThe only thing more surprising than Fubo doubling in 2025, is that the shares had quintupled shortly after the partnership and court settlement were announced. In other words, it has already given back more than half of January's peak value.\nOn its own, Fubo will be fine. It will have a pair of nine-figure paydays in its back pocket, that it can use to amplify growth opportunities alongside its newfound positive free cash flow. The prospects could be even better with Disney owning 70% of the company, but with Fubo's management at the wheel. Fubo will be the country's second-largest live TV streaming service. It will have the marketing muscle and global prestige of Disney in its corner.\nHulu + Live TV streaming has always been in Disney's back burner. While Disney keeps trying to bundle Disney+ (124.6 million subscribers), Hulu (49 million), and ESPN+ (24.9 million), its live TV streaming service is seemingly an afterthought. Why does it serve less than 10% of Hulu subscribers or less than 4% of Disney+ members? I would be surprised if under Fubo's laser-focused autonomy that the combined platform doesn't grow to seriously take on Alphabet's YouTube TV for market leadership. All roads seem to lead to Fubo moving higher, making this a stock to buy like there's no tomorrow.\nBefore you buy stock infuboTV, consider this:\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 andfuboTVwasn\u2019t one of them.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nLast week's rally in the broader stock market indexes sprung theNasdaq Composite(^IXIC-0.12%)back upward after a more than 20% that technically put it into a bear market. However, it's apparent that market volatility may be far from over.\nIncome investors looking at the current landscape may be wondering if now is the best time to buydividend stocksgiven the wild swings to the upside and the downside. Here are some risks worth considering before buying dividend stocks and whyExxonMobil(XOM-0.03%)is a good example of a dividend stock that you can buy with confidence during a bear market.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nInvestors who use dividends for financial planning or to supplement income in retirement will want to target companies with reliable payouts. After all, what good is a dividend if a company cuts it at the slightest sign of economic uncertainty?\nExxonMobil has raised its dividend for42 consecutive years-- which may come as a surprise given the ups and downs in the oil and gas industry. In the last decade alone, there was the crash of 2014 and 2015 and the plunge during the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, ExxonMobil reported its worst year on record in 2020 -- a staggering $22.4 billion loss.\nEven during a period of high uncertainty and a collapse in the global economy, ExxonMobil kept its dividend streak alive in 2020 because it relied on the strength of its balance sheet.\nExxonMobil's balance sheet is in its best shape in over a decade.\nExxonMobil's net total long-term debt position is just $14.7 billion, which is small for a company of its size. Its financial debt-to-equity ratio of 0.08 and debt-to-capital ratio of 12.5% showcase how the company has reduced its dependence on debt and can rely on free cash flow to fund operating expenses and long-term investments.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor\u2019stotal average return is800%\u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now\u2026\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nIn fact, ExxonMobil has the lowest debt-to-capital ratio of the major integrated U.S. and European oil and gas companies -- a close second being its U.S. peerChevron.\nBP Debt To Capital (Quarterly)data byYCharts\nExxonMobil can support its dividend even if margins fall due to lower oil and gas prices. The company has considerably improved its cost structure and technological advancements that havereduced production costs.\nExxonMobil has a long-term plan through 2030 built around Brent (the international benchmark) crude oil prices averaging $65 per barrel. However, it also has an optimistic scenario at $85 Brent and a pessimistic outcome at $55 per barrel. Even at $55 per barrel, ExxonMobil expects to earn acash surplus of $110 billion from 2025 to 2030thanks to higher free cash flow from its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, development of onshore assets in the Permian Basin, production expansion offshore Guyana, and other moves.\nBrent crude oil prices averaged $81 per barrel in 2024 but have fallen in recent weeks due to tariff tensions, production increases in the Middle East, and recession fears. Brent crude oil is at a three-year low of around $63.60 at the time of this writing. But again, even at this level, the dividend is manageable -- although ExxonMobil may pull back on near-term capital expenditures if prices stay low.\nThe third risk worth considering before scooping up shares of dividend stocks during a bear market is whether the company can endure a prolonged slowdown. Or, in this case, tariffs.\nDividend affordability and a strong balance sheet are part of the equation, but so are competitive advantages. ExxonMobil can profit from its oil and gas production portfolio even at lower prices. Unlike some pure-play companies, ExxonMobil isn't dependent on a single geographic region. ExxonMobil also has a massive refining business and a growing low-carbon division. So, in the event of a slowdown, the company should bewell positioned to take market shareor even pounce on an acquisition opportunity.\nNot all dividend-paying companies have ExxonMobil's advantages. Some companies had strained balance sheets heading into 2025. Others have a dividend expense that is alreadyeating up the bulk of profits. So, for these companies, if profits come down and stay down for too long, there could be pressure for a dividend cut.\nDividends are an excellent way to collect passive income no matter what stock prices are doing -- allowing investors to book a return without having to sell stock. But a dividend is only as reliable as the company paying it.\nDespite operating in the cyclical oil and gas industry, ExxonMobil is a beacon of dividend reliability. With a yield of 4%, ExxonMobil is an excellent way to generate a sizable amount of passive income while staying invested in the market.\nBefore you buy stock inExxonMobil, consider this:\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 andExxonMobilwasn\u2019t one of them.

The information technology sector is the largest by a wide margin, representing 29.9% of the entire value of the index.\nThe S&P 500 recently suffered a peak-to-trough decline of 19%, falling just shy of the bear-market threshold of 20%. However, theS&P 500 Information Technologyindex plunged by as much as 26%, placing it firmly in bear territory.Apple,Microsoft, andNvidiaare just some of the heavyweights in the information technology sector, so it's a good proxy for the performance of some of America's most valuable companies.\nTheVanguard Information Technology ETF(VGT0.47%)exclusively invests in stocks from the information technology sector (including those inside and outside the S&P 500), and it has outperformed the S&P 500 every year, on average since it was established in 2004. Therefore, investors with a spare $550 might want to take the opportunity to buy one share in this fund while it's trading at a discount during the tech bear market.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nOn April 2, President Trump announced plans to impose a sweeping 10%tariffon all physical products imported into America, in addition to a series of much higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on goods from specific countries. The reciprocal tariffs have since been paused for 90 days pending negotiations between the U.S. and its trading partners, except for those placed on China, which remain active.\nSweeping tariffs have immediately increased the cost of living for consumers, which could dent America's economic growth. Plus, some countries have imposed their own tariffs in retaliation, which will also hurt U.S. exporters. This is a cocktail for weaker corporate earnings, which is whythe S&P 500 suffered such a sharp declineover the last few weeks.\nHowever, many of the products and services produced by companies in the information technology sector aren't directly affected by the tariffs, which is why I believe the sector's underperformance relative to theS&P 500represents a big opportunity for investors. For example, semiconductors have been excluded from President Trump's tariffs from the beginning, which means the industry-leadingartificial intelligence(AI) chips produced by companies like Nvidia andBroadcomwon't be affected.\nMoreover,Microsoftprimarily sells digital products like the Windows operating system and 365 productivity suite (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), in addition tocloud servicesthrough its Azure platform. None of those are subject to the tariffs (for now). Further, last weekend, President Trump announced that smartphones and computers will be removed from the reciprocal tariffs that are still in place on imports from China. This significantly benefits Apple, which manufactures around 90% of its iPhones in that country.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor\u2019stotal average return is800%\u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now\u2026\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nBelow is a list of other holdings in the Vanguard Information TechnologyETFthat primarily sell software, cloud services, digital products, or exempted products like semiconductors:\nStock\nVanguard ETF Portfolio Weighting\nSalesforce\n1.78%\nOracle\n1.72%\nAccenture\n1.38%\nAdobe\n1.22%\nPalantir Technologies\n1.13%\nQualcomm\n1.12%\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n1.02%\nPalo Alto Networks\n0.81%\nMicron Technology\n0.68%\nCrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD)\n0.63%\nData source: Vanguard. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Feb. 28, 2025, and are subject to change.\nThe Vanguard ETF holds 314 different stocks. However, the above 10 stocks, combined with Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Broadcom, account for a whopping 61.7% of the entire value of its portfolio.\nWith all of that said, even though the above companies aren't directly impacted by tariffs, they are likely to suffer indirect consequences from President Trump's trade policies. If the U.S. economy does slow down, they will experience weaker demand for their products and services. This effect could be especially pronounced for the likes of Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD, which are relying on hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data center infrastructure spending from just a handful of customers each year to fuel their growth.\nSome of that potential risk is already priced in.Nvidia stock, for instance, is down by 25% from its record high, wiping a staggering $900 billion off the company'smarket capitalization. That reduces the potential downside risk for investors who swoop in and buy the Vanguard ETF today.\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF was recently down by as much as 27% from its record high, so it's heavily underperforming the S&P 500 at the moment. However, the picture looks very different when we zoom out and examine its long-term performance.\nThe Vanguard ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 12.8% since it was established in 2004, comfortably beating the average annual gain of 9.6% in the S&P 500 over the same period. That 3.2 percentage point difference doesn't sound like much at face value, but it would have made a world of difference in dollar terms thanks to the magic of compounding:\nStarting Balance In 2004\nCompound Annual Return\nBalance In 2025\n$50,000\n12.8%\n$627,279\n$50,000\n9.6%\n$342,761\nCalculations by author.\nIn my view, even if the economy slows due toglobal trade tensions, investors are likely to continue buying quality stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. These companies have incredibly strong balance sheets with plenty of cash on hand, in addition to reliable earnings and leadership positions in their respective industries. They could still be the best houses in a bad neighborhood, so to speak, as the rest of the market faces the same economic challenges.\nPlus, PwC predicts the AI revolution will add a whopping $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, and much of that value will be created by the companies in the information technology sector. As a result, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF might be a great buy during the tech bear market.\nBefore you buy shares in theVanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 and theVanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETFwasn\u2019t one of them.

The recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November 2024) have bolstered the stock market, making 2024 a strong year for equities. Donald Trump\u2019s presidential win in November sparked additional market gains, sending indices to record highs in the days following his victory.

    "content": "URL: https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-signs-large-carbon-removal-090352364.html?.tsrc=rss\nContent:\nBy Valerie Volcovici\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Microsoft said on Tuesday it signed a contract for a project in Louisiana that would remove 6.75 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over 15 years, which it says is the world's biggest permanent carbon removal project to date.\nThe technology giant's greenhouse gas emissions were 29.1% higher than 2020 levels last year amid growing demand for energy for artificial intelligence uses and it last reported annual greenhouse gas emissions of 17.2 million tons at the end of 2023.\nThe bioenergy carbon capture and storage project being developed by carbon capture company AtmosClear is located at the Port of Greater Baton Rouge and will use materials like sugarcane bagasse and forest trimmings to generate energy and capture the associated carbon emissions and store them underground.\nThe agreement is a part of Microsoft's goal to become carbon negative by 2030.\nThe announcement comes amid uncertainty about the future of U.S. carbon removal and sequestration projects, which have been incentivized over the last few years by an $85 a ton federal tax credit known as 45Q. The Trump administration is seeking to reverse numerous decarbonization incentives put in place during former President Joe Biden's time in office in upcoming budget negotiations.\nThe companies did not comment on whether the project would proceed if the tax credit is scaled back or repealed by the Trump administration.\nFidelis, the Texas-based company that owns AtmosClear, said it expects to use the 45Q tax credit for the carbon sequestration component of the project.\nFidelis has estimated that the project will result in more than $800 million of investment and around 75 permanent and 600 construction jobs, and could revive forestry management jobs in the region that had been impacted by recent mill closures.\nBrian Marrs, Microsoft's senior director of energy and carbon, said in a statement the technology giant valued the deal's emphasis on jobs in local agricultural communities. It would also show Louisiana's leadership in becoming a hub for carbon management research and applied technology, he said.\nLouisiana state officials have been lobbying the U.S. Department of Energy and the state's congressional delegation over the last few days to urge them to save federal funding to support the state's planned Direct Air Capture hub in Calcasieu Parish, as well as the 45Q tax credit.\nConstruction of the plant would begin in 2026, with commercial operations slated to start in 2029.\n(Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Jamie Freed)\nPresident Donald Trump bitterly attacked \u201c60 Minutes\u201d shortly after the CBS newsmagazine broadcast stories on Ukraine and Greenland on Sunday, saying the network was out of control and should \u201cpay a big price\u201d for going after him.\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Monday suggested that he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs he previously imposed on the sector, to give carmakers time to adjust their supply chains.\nDeepening the U.S.-Canada relationship is the obvious play, and it should not be difficult to accomplish\nCALGARY \u2014 Hundreds of kilometres up the Pacific coast from where Canada\u2019s first liquefied natural gas export terminal is set to start up this summer, a monster lays dormant.\nCarlo Dade: The only deal on the table from the Americans is the certainty of humiliation in exchange for an illusion\nSpiking yields are credited with forcing the president's stunning about-face on tariffs. Here's why bonds are boss\nThe Canadian dollar's current value is something of a change for the not-so-long-ago beleaguered currency\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Rancher Brett Kenzy hopes President Donald Trump's tariffs will make imported beef expensive enough that Americans will turn to cattle raised at home for all their hamburgers and steaks.\nU.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China comes at a bad time for sorghum growers like Dan Atkisson in Kansas, who is nevertheless preparing to increase plantings by 25% this spring.  China accounted for nearly 90% of U.S. sorghum exports last year, ramping up purchases of the crop it uses to feed livestock and make fiery baijiu liquor.  U.S. sorghum exports to China dropped to 78,316 metric tons in January and February from more than 1.4 million metric tons over the same period a year earlier, down 95%, according to U.S. government data.\nThe Canadian dollar edged back on Monday from an earlier five-month high against its U.S. counterpart as oil prices fell and investors turned their attention to a Bank of Canada interest rate decision this week.  The loonie was trading 0.1% lower at 1.3875 per U.S. dollar, or 72.07 U.S. cents, after touching its strongest intraday level since November 6, at 1.3829.  \u201cEveryone is looking towards the inflation report for Tuesday and then the Bank of Canada monetary policy decision on Wednesday.\u201d"

On the other hand, construction machinery companies are at the whim of economic cycles.

This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by potential trade policy changes and corporate tax discussions, which could impact business confidence and growth.

The modest moves offer some respite following the huge swings that have battered Wall Street recently, not just day to day but also hour to hour.  The day before, the S&P 500 went from a gain of 1.8% to a slight loss and back to a gain as it struggled to keep up with shifts in President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, which economists warn could cause a global recession unless it\u2019s scaled back.\nLVMH lost its position on Tuesday as Europe's largest luxury company in terms of market capitalization after being overtaken by rival Hermes due to investor pessimism after disappointing first-quarter revenue from the sector bellwether.  LVMH, whose high-end brands include Louis Vuitton and Dior, jewellery brand Tiffany & Co. and beauty chain Sephora, missed expectations for first-quarter sales as U.S. shoppers curbed purchases of beauty products and cognac while sales in China remained weak.  LVMH shares dropped 7%, bringing its market capitalization down to 246 billion euros, compared to 247 billion euros for Hermes.\nRespondents to BofA's monthly survey of fund managers were a net 36% underweight U.S. equities, the most in nearly two years, a number that has plunged by 53 percentage points since February, the biggest such fall on their records.

Li was at her firm's booth at the Canton Fair, China's biggest trade expo held twice-a-year in the southern city of Guangzhou, where more than 30,000 exhibitors showcase their products over an area larger than 200 football fields.

Operating in the consumer staples space, consumers tend to keep buying its products right through periods of stock market and economic turmoil. That's how Coca-Cola has managed to support and grow its dividend through the years despite often material headwinds.\nWhile Coca-Cola is an elite company, it is far from the only consumer staples maker that can help you rest easy amid stock market unrest. Here are a few others.\nIf the stock market falls into a bear market are you going to stop buying toothpaste, toilet paper, and soda? If the economy succumbs to a recession, will you stop using soap, laundry detergent, and food? That answer, I hope, to those two questions is no. And this is whyconsumer staples makersare so attractive during troubled times (if not all the time).\nImage source: Getty Images.\nMany of the products that companies like Coca-Cola sell aren't actually necessities. In this case you could just drink tap water instead of soda. However, the cost of most consumer staples products is fairly modest while the benefits are material, even if those benefits are really just emotional.\u00a0Brand loyalty tends to run high in the consumer staples niche. Even better, consumer staples products are bought frequently because they get used regularly.\nIf you are having trouble sleeping at night amid market uncertainty, you should consider adding some more consumer staples stocks to your portfolio mix.\nCoca-Cola is a solid choice for highly conservative investors. It has an above-market dividend yield of 2.9% backed by a dividend that has been increased annually for more than 50 years, making this beverage gianta Dividend King. The company has a global distribution network, strong R&D skills, and massive marketing heft. The only problem is that the stock looks a little expensive right now, with its price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios both above their five-year averages. If you're willing to pay up for safety, you might want to buy Coca-Cola.\nButbeveragepeerPepsiCo(PEP-2.40%)has similar business strengths and a more diversified portfolio that includes snacks and packaged foods. It is also a Dividend King. However, the real attraction lies in its valuation, with PepsiCo's P/S and P/E ratios both below their five-year averages. Its dividend yield is an even higher 3.7%. And with PepsiCo investing in growth through bolt-on acquisitions, it is continuing to grow its business with the same playbook that has worked well for more than five decades.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor\u2019stotal average return is800%\u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now\u2026\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nThat said, you might want something a little different.Unilever(UL-0.21%)could be just what you are looking for, with its portfolio of consumer products and food. The big story with Unilever is that North America and Europe only make up around 40% of its top line, with the rest coming from Latin America and Asia, where economic growth is expected to be higher over the long term. Add in a 3.1%dividend yieldand this is an attractive consumer staples option for those with a more adventurous bent.\nThen there are ultra high yielders likeAltria(MO1.00%)andBritish American Tobacco(BTI0.91%). Both of these cigarette makers are facing material long-term headwinds as the volume of the cigarettes they sell has been in decline for years. However, smokers tend to be very loyal and often increase their use of cigarettes during uncertain times. During the coronavirus pandemic, both Altria and British American Tobacco put up their strongest volume numbers in years.\nWhile these twotobacco companiescome with material long-term risks, the short-term benefit of collecting Altria's 7.2% yield and British American Tobacco's 7.5% yield might be worth it for some investors. Given the nature of cigarettes, those lofty yields are likely to be safe over the near term.\nAlthough all of the companies listed here are attractive in their own way, the list is hardly exhaustive. There are many more consumer staples stocks that are worth looking at if you are worried about the market and feara recession.\u00a0While there is no way to fully avoid the impact of either of these big-picture events, buying companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Unilever, Altria, and British American Tobacco can help ease your worries and let you rest a little better thanks to their reliable businesses and dividends.\nBefore you buy stock inCoca-Cola, consider this:\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 andCoca-Colawasn\u2019t one of them.

But yo-yo stock markets aren't so fun for grown-up investors. And unfortunately, there's been a lot more down \"yo\" recently than up \"yo.\"\nMany investors might feel as if they're getting whiplash from the market's frantic gyrations, fueled by the Trump administration's back-and-forth announcements abouttariffs. However, I think three growth stocks are no-brainer picks to buy on the bounce.\nOn one hand, it's understandable thatAmazon's(AMZN-1.30%)share price fell as much as 29% below its previous high during the recent market sell-off. After all, the company's e-commerce revenue could be at risk if tariffs lead to an economic decline that causes consumer spending to sink. On the other hand, I'd argue that Amazon is more insulated from a faltering economy than meets the eye.\nFor one thing, I suspect consumers could turn to Amazon nearly as much if the economy stumbles as they would if it remains strong. Why? Amazon's e-commerce platform offers low prices on millions of products. As a case in point, independent market research company Profitero has named Amazon the lowest-priced online retailer in the U.S. for eight consecutive years.\nAlso, Amazon should continue to benefit from an unstoppable tailwind that isn't going away. I'm referring to the rapid advances and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), especiallygenerative AI. Most AI applications are and will be hosted on the cloud. As the largest cloud services provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is poised to grow tremendously in the coming years -- regardless of what happens with tariffs or the economy.\nAI isn't just a growth driver for AWS, though. I believe Amazon has an opportunity to be a leader in the new era of AI personal assistants. AI is also already helping to make the company's other businesses more efficient and more profitable. Buying Amazon on pullbacks has always paid off in the past; I expect it will again.\nMeta Platforms'(META-1.88%)trajectory in recent weeks has been similar to Amazon's. I think the reasons for buying Meta stock on the bounce are similar to those for Amazon, too.\nFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp together pull in 3.35 billion people on average every day. That's more than 40% of the entire world population. Sure, advertising revenue on these apps could decline somewhat in an economic downturn. However, Meta simply commands too large an audience for advertisers to ignore. I think the company will continue to rake in billions of dollars in revenue and profits regardless of what happens with the economy.\nMeta isn't a cloud services provider like Amazon. However, the company is and should continue to be a big winner from AI. The technology is critical for increasing the monetization of Meta's apps. Meta is also using generative AI to help advertisers create marketing campaigns more quickly and efficiently.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg said in his company's fourth-quarter earnings call Meta AI \"is already used by more people than any other [AI] assistant.\" He predicted that more than 1 billion people will use AI assistants in 2025 and that Meta AI will be the market leader. Zuckerberg also thinks Meta will find out this year if AI smartglasses are on track to be \"the next computing platform.\" I suspect he's right about Meta AI and that smartglasses could very well be the next big thing in AI. If so, this stock should have a lot of room to run.\nVertex Pharmaceuticals'(VRTX0.90%)stock has held up remarkably well amid all the market volatility. However, thebiotech stockdid slip somewhat and has partially rebounded. I think the relatively modest dip presents a great buying opportunity.\nMy primary reason for optimism about Vertex over the near term is the launch of its new pain drug Journavx. The most important things to know about Journavx are: (1) it's effective at alleviating acute pain, and (2) it's not an opioid. The market potential for a safe and effective non-opioid painkiller is huge.\nI also like Vertex's opportunity with its newest cystic fibrosis (CF) drug, Alyftrek, which won U.S. regulatory approval in December 2024. Granted, Alyftrek will probably cannibalize sales from Vertex's other CF therapies. However, it should be more profitable than the company's older drugs because of lower royalty payments.\nGene-editing therapy Casgevy should slowly ramp up sales as a one-and-done treatment for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. Vertex also has a promising pipeline featuring four late-stage programs with significant commercial potential. I predict this stock will deliver solid returns over the rest of the decade no matter what happens with tariffs or the economy.\nBefore you buy stock inVertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 andVertex Pharmaceuticalswasn\u2019t one of them.

But there are two interesting things about this company. First, it is run kind of like a mutual fund. Second, it doesn't pay dividends despite the fact that Buffett often invests in dividend-paying companies. Here's why that matters and why you might want to buy one of these three dividend payers he owns.\nOne of the core tenets ofBuffett's investment approachis to buy good companies when they are attractively priced. But the next step is to hold for the long term so he can benefit from the growth of the businesses he buys. One of the nuances that gets lost in this is that he uses the cash generated from the companies he owns outright or owns in Berkshire Hathaway's common stock portfolio to reinvest in his business. That allows him to compound those cash flows over time and this enhances the returns he generates for investors.\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\nFrom a big-picture perspective, you can do the same thing bydividend reinvesting. All it takes is a phone call to your broker, or, more likely, a button press on your broker's website or in its app. And in one quick and easy move you'll be investing more like Warren Buffett.\nBut what if you want to invest even more like Oracle of Omaha? Well, three dividend-paying stocks he owns today areCoca-Cola(KO-0.68%),Chevron(CVX-0.28%), andKraft Heinz(KHC-1.02%). Here's a look at these three Buffett stocks to see if they'll be a good fit for your Buffett style dividend reinvesting.\nCoca-Cola is a very easy company to like. It is the industry-leading beverage company with a globally diversified business. It is large enough to have economies of scale in distribution, marketing, and research and development, and it can, and does, act as an industry consolidator. The dividend has been increased annually for over five decades, making ita Dividend King. The dividend yield is 2.9%, which is well above the market's yield today.\nFor conservative dividend investors it is a solid choice. The only problem is that the stock looks a little expensive at the moment, with both the price-to-sales andprice-to-earningsratios above their five-year averages. However, if you are willing to pay a premium for income security, Coca-Cola could be a good fit for your portfolio.\nAnother industry leader in Buffett's portfolio isenergygiant Chevron. It is one of the largest integrated energy companies you can buy, with a business that spans from the upstream (energy production) through the midstream (pipelines) and into the downstream (chemicals and refining). This diversification helps to soften the impact of the inherent swings in the commodity-driven energy sector. On top of that, the company has a very strong balance sheet, which allows it to take on leverage during industry downturns to support its business and dividend.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor\u2019stotal average return is800%\u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now\u2026\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nThe dividend, notably, has been increased annually for 38 years thanks largely to Chevron's solid business model. That said, energy price volatility still has a material impact on the stock price. Right now energy prices are weakening andthe dividend yieldis a very attractive 4.7%. The yield could go higher if oil prices continue to fall. But the history here suggests that the dividend will continue to get paid even if oil prices continue to fall. You could try to time your entry into Chevron, but the truth is it is a strong energy choice at just about any point of the energy cycle.\nThe last big dividend stock on this list is Kraft Heinz. It is a toughconsumer staples stockto love when you compare it to Coca-Cola. Yes, Kraft Heinz's dividend yield is a lofty 5.3%, but the dividend has been static since it was cut in 2019. The big story is the business overhaul that's taking place.\nThe company was created via the merger between Kraft and Heinz. The goal at that time was to cut costs to boost profitability. But cutting costs can only take a company so far before it needs to refocus on growth. That's what Kraft Heinz has been doing, after turning to a new management team. But the results haven't been particularly impressive, which is why the dividend has been stuck in neutral for so long. If you consider this high-yield food maker you'll need to go in understanding that it is aturnaroundstory that will require extra monitoring. It's probably only appropriate for more aggressive investors.\nWhile Buffett owns Coca-Cola, Chevron, and Kraft Heinz in his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, you don't actually need to own these specific stocks to benefit from dividend reinvestment. These are just three stocks to get you thinking about the real investment tool that's important here, which is the reinvestment of dividends so you can compound your returns over time -- just like Buffett does with his investments.\nBefore you buy stock inChevron, consider this:\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 andChevronwasn\u2019t one of them.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nOil prices have tumbled this year. WTI, the primary U.S. oil price benchmark, has plunged from about $80 a barrel in early January to around $60 a barrel. The culprit has been the concern that tariffs will slow the global economy, driving down demand for crude oil.\nLower crude prices will impact oil company cash flows. However, someoil stocksarein a better positionto navigate the lower oil prices than others due to theirabundantlow-cost oil resources. Three oil companies that can still thrive in the current environment areDevon Energy(DVN-0.70%),ConocoPhillips(COP-0.65%), andChevron(CVX-0.33%).\nDevon Energy has a premier multibasin U.S. onshore resource portfolio. The company produces oil and gas from the Rockies, Delaware Basin, Anadarko Basin, and Eagle Ford. That diversification helps reduce risk and enhances its long-term growth profile.\nThe Delaware Basin, which runs through west Texas and southeast New Mexico, is the crown jewel of Devon Energy's portfolio. The company gets 56% of its production from that world-class oil resource. That position will fuel the oil company for years to come. Devon has thousands of remaining drilling locations with an average breakeven level of $40 per barrel. Because of that, it can still make a lot of money drilling in the region at the current oil price point.\nThe company's low-cost resources position it to produce a lot of cash even in the current environment. Devon was on track to make over $3 billion in free cash flow this year when WTI was above $70 a barrel during the first quarter. While that number will decline if crude remains around $60, Devon will still produce a lot of excess cash this year. It plans to return about 70% of that money to shareholders via its dividend and share repurchases, retaining the rest to strengthen its already rock-solid balance sheet.\nConocoPhillips has a global portfolio of low-cost resources. The company held about 20 billionbarrels of oil equivalentresources with a supply cost below $40 a barrel for WTI. It added even more low-cost resources last year when it acquired Marathon Oil. That deal topped off its tank by adding more than 2 billion barrels of resources with an averagecost of supplybelow $30 per barrel for WTI.\nThe company's low-cost resources position it to produce a lot of cash in the current environment. ConocoPhillips initially expected to generate enough excess free cash flow this year to return $10 billion to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. While lower oil prices will impact the amount of excess free cash flow it produces this year, itcould still achieve that capital return target thanks to its cash-rich balance sheet. ConocoPhillips ended last year with $6.4 billion of cash and short-term investments and another $1 billion of long-term investments. Meanwhile, it'sworking toward generating an additional $2 billion in cash via non-core asset sales.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That integration between upstream (oil and gas production) and downstream (refining and chemicals) helps mute some of theimpactof lower oil prices. The company also has a very low-cost global resource portfolio.\nThe energy giant has stress-tested its business for lower oil prices. Chevron forecasts that it can produce enough cash flow from operations to cover its high-yielding dividend (currently over 5%) and capital spending program at $50 oil through 2027 with room to spare. Meanwhile, the company has the balance sheet capacity to buy back shares at the low end of its $10 billion-$20 billion annual target range during that period at that price point.\nChevron is working to further enhance its low-cost resource portfolio by acquiringHess. The deal would add a world-class position in offshore Guyana and other high-quality assets to diversify and enhance Chevron's portfolio. It would further bolster the company's low-cost supplies, putting it in an even stronger position to thrive duringperiods oflower oil prices.\nThe recent downdraft in crude prices will impact the cash flows that oil companies produce. However, Devon Energy, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron haveverylow-cost operations and strong balance sheets. Because of that, they can still thrive at lower prices by producing lots of cash that they can return to investors through dividends and share repurchases.

After an intense manhunt, the suspected assailant was caught and identified as Luigi Mangione.\nThe case against 26-year-old Mangione, which includes state and federal charges, is moving swiftly. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced earlier this month that the Justice Department willseek the death penaltyagainst Mangione, who allegedly wrote the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d on shell casings used in the murder of the health insurance executive. Mangione\u2019s lawyers have since asked a federal judge toblock the DOJ\u2019s attemptat capital punishment.\nAnd while Mangione\u2019s courtroom drama unfolds, the slaying\u2019s impact is still rippling through the healthcare industry, from payers to pharma.\nNews of the murder uncorked long-simmering outrage across the country over insurer profits and patients\u2019 struggles to pay for healthcare. Scrutiny of UnitedHealth \u2014 the largest U.S. health insurance company \u2014 has quickly intensified.\nWith a market capitalization ofover $400 billion, UnitedHealth brings in as much revenue as the tech giant Apple.\nLaunched in the 1970s in Minnesota, the insurance companybuilt its empirethrough a string of deals that expanded its reach. Several large acquisitions deepened United\u2019s investment into the Medicare coverage field. It also swallowed up several insurance competitors, bought hundreds of surgical sites, became a player in the home health industry and launched a pharmacy benefit manager called Optum Rx.\nThroughout its history, UnitedHealth has been embroiled in controversies that include antitrust suits and astock manipulation scandalin 2006 that led its CEO to resign.\nBefore Thompson was murdered, UnitedHealth was beinginvestigated by the DOJfor potential antitrust activities, and PBMs in general have beenunder a microscopefrom U.S. lawmakers over their role in drug pricing. Now, more revelations have turned the heat up on UnitedHealth\u2019s business dealings in the fraught U.S. healthcare system.\nA range of policymakers and regulators are unpacking more about the company\u2019s far-reaching business \u2014 and United is fighting back by blaming the pharma industry and other players in healthcare. Meanwhile, industry executives have been shoring up security as distrust and criticisms of the industry mount.\nThe killing of a chief executive shed light on the disparities inherent in a system that rewards corporate profit-seeking while leaving millions of patients unable to afford life-saving medications.\nKeep up with the story. Subscribe to the PharmaVoice free daily newsletter\nBefore Thompson\u2019s assassination, UnitedHealth was raking in billions from price hikes from 2017 to 2022 on drugs for patients with conditions like heart disease and cancer, according to areportfrom the Federal Trade Commission.\nAlong with fellow PBMs Cigna and CVS Health, drug markups with percentages sometimes in the thousands drove revenue of $7.3 billion above what they paid for the drugs in the first place, the regulator said.\nInvestigators have found that these companies allegedly continue to pump up revenues through extralegal means. Anaudit in Tennesseerevealed that Cigna\u2019s Express Scripts in 2023 mishandled transactions with pharmacies to keep from paying reimbursements.\nUnitedHealth has also raked in profit from government insurers like Medicare. Through Medicare Advantage, PBMs madeabout $33 billionin 2021 from coding diagnoses that exaggerated patients\u2019 conditions to pull in more from the program, and UnitedHealth made up about half of those additional payments, according to a report in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\nIn response to the scrutiny, United hasn\u2019t conceded much with its business model. Instead, the insurance giant has blamed the pharma industry.\nDuring the company\u2019s end-of-year earnings call in January, UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty pointed to the high cost of drugs in the U.S. compared to other countries and specifically called out GLP-1 drugmakers, noting that \u201cone drug whichcosts $900 in the U.S.costs about a tenth of that in Europe.\u201d He also defended the role of Optum Rx in negotiating \u201cmany tens of billions of dollars in savings\u201d for patients and passing through 98% of rebates directly to patients.\nBeyond drug prices, Witty said that hospitals benefit from higher costs for healthcare services. The comments came as the company declaredrecord revenues in 2024that topped $400 billion.\nIn the months since, United has made at least one notable change on the PBM side: Optum Rx willstop requiring reauthorizationsfor around 80 drugs. The move will eliminate some paperwork burdens for physicians and patients and cut about 10% of Optum\u2019s prior authorizations, the PBM said in March.\nPrior authorizations, which require providers to receive approval from a patient\u2019s insurance plan before providing a service or drug, are a majorsource of discontentamong providers and patients. UnitedHealthcare also said last month that it planned toreduce 10%of prior authorizations this year.\nWhile much of the public ire related to the Thompson murder has been directed at health insurers, a range of companies are investing in beefed up security for their top executives.\nOver 70% of companies across industries have security plans in place for their top leaders, according to a surveyconducted by HR Policy Associationreleased earlier this year. While 37% focus their security efforts solely on the CEO, nearly 70% provide protection for all C-suite executives, and most use third-party contractors. Over half of the 180 respondents to the survey said they are prioritizing security for travel and physical safety in 2025.\nIn pharma, the increased emphasis on safety was acutely felt at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco in January, which is one of the industry\u2019s largest events of the year. The San Francisco Police Departmentadded barriersand checkpoints to the event\u2019s main hub \u2014 the Westin St. Francis hotel \u2014 and canceled some officers\u2019 days off to make sure the event was fully staffed.\nProxy statements released this year have also revealed just how much large pharmas are shelling out to protect their executives. About $960,000 of Moderna\u2019sCEO pay packagefor St\u00e9phane Bancel was used for security in 2024.\nPfizer spentmore than $661,000to protect CEO Albert Bourla, while Gilead Sciencesreportedmore than $285,000 in security services for CEO Daniel O\u2019Day. In general,other large pharmas\u2014 including Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly \u2014 spent between $70,000 and $200,000 on CEO security last year.\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry leaders\nThe tariff war has prompted new calls to reshore manufacturing.

What this means is that we are slowing or pausing some early-stage projects.\u201d\nIn January,\u00a0Microsoft President Brad Smith said the company was planning to spend roughly$80 billion during the current fiscal yearon AI-enabled data centers to train large language models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications.\nThe software provider remains on track to achieve this spending goal despiteWalsh\u2019s comments,a spokesperson told CFO Dive, adding the company had nothing further to share on the matter.\nThe pullback comes as Microsoft and other big tech companies face growing investorscrutiny over their heavy AI spending.\nIt also comes as President Donald Trump\u2019s on-again, off-againtariff measures are creating added pressureand uncertainty for tech executives.\nWedbush analysts have called the current tariff situation an \u201ceconomic Twilight Zone\u201d that has created \u201creal damage to the corporate spending mentality.\u201d\n\u201cWe estimate that 10%-15% (could be conservative) of many cloud and AI initiatives in the US we are tracking in the field could be pushed/slowed down during this period of uncertainty and Microsoft will be front and center in this economic period of uncertainty,\u201d the analysts said in a research note last week.\nThe administration imposed sweeping new levies on imported goods on April 2, but has since walked some of them back. On April 9, Trump announced a 90-day pause on some tariffs on goods from most U.S. trade partners while imposing 125% tariffs on China, triggering a full-scale trade war with the country. China has retaliated by hiking its tariffs on goods imported from the U.S. to 125%.\nOther tariffs that remain in place in the U.S. include a baseline tariff of 10% for trading partners targeted in Trump\u2019s sweeping April 2 announcement as well as levies imposed on steel and aluminum imports.\nMeanwhile, on Sunday,Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnicksaid a Friday decision by the administration to exempt electronic devices such as smartphones, iPhones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs \u2014 including the 125% levies imposed on Chinese imports \u2014 was only a temporary reprieve, with those products expected to face separate levies in the near future.\nPrior to the Friday announcement, analysts predicted the reciprocal tariffs would be devastating to IT hardware companies that have substantial China production exposure. Morgan Stanley analysts had estimated that Apple alone faced an annual sales impact of as much as $33 billion.\nTariffs can also potentially harm the tech sector by causing enterprise customers to tighten their IT spending and raising the cost of raw materials such as steel needed for building data centers, according to Hank Galligan, BDO\u2019s national technology industry leader.\n\u201cClearly, the cost will have an impact on the amount of capacity that will be able to be built,\u201d he said in an interview.\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\nIt could take a while \u2014 perhaps years \u2014 before the technology\u2019s full potential is realized, yet C-suites need to prepare now, analysts say.\nFederal Reserve officials, scheduled to assess monetary policy during a March 18-19 meeting, will likely zero in on a jump in long-term inflation expectations.\nSubscribe to CFO Dive for top news, trends & analysis\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\nIt could take a while \u2014 perhaps years \u2014 before the technology\u2019s full potential is realized, yet C-suites need to prepare now, analysts say.\nFederal Reserve officials, scheduled to assess monetary policy during a March 18-19 meeting, will likely zero in on a jump in long-term inflation expectations.\nThe free newsletter covering the top industry headlines"

US government bonds rebounded from a five-day selloff that last week sent 10-year yields surging by the most in over two decades and fanned fears that an accelerating exodus from the securities would push the financial system toward a crisis.\nThe relief \u2014 however fleeting it may turn out to be \u2014 was echoed in the equity market, where major indexes saw modest gains after Trump extended a temporary tariff exemption to imports of smartphones and other electronics and did nothing new to accelerate his conflict with China.\n\u201cNo news is good news in this environment,\u201d said Adam Phillips, managing director of investments at EP Wealth Advisors.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saying the bottoms are in \u2014 we\u2019re hopeful they are \u2014 but things can flare up at any time. One press conference or post on X could spark new headwinds,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the clear yet.\u201d\nThe bond market\u2019s recovery pulled down the benchmark 10-year Treasury rate by about 12 basis points on Monday as bonds advanced across the curve. The move extended on Tuesday in Asia, with the 10-year yield falling three basis points to 4.35%. Yields on Australia and New Zealand sovereign notes also dropped.\nThe rebound in bonds eased concerns that built last week, when a steady rise in yields threatened to deal the US economy another hit by pushing up the cost of all kinds of loans. There was speculation it may worsen as Trump undermines confidence in US policy, with some speculating the Federal Reserve would potentially need to step in.\nBut yields had risen so much \u2014 and so quickly \u2014 that by Monday some on Wall Street were seeing it as a chance to buy, especially since bonds will likely gain if the economy stalls and the Fed resumes cutting interest rates.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent moved to tamp down concerns about the market in an interview with Bloomberg Television, saying he has tools to steady it, such as buybacks, if needed. He also said there\u2019s no evidence that overseas governments are selling their stockpiles of Treasuries.\nJPMorgan Asset Management\u2019s Bob Michele, the global head of fixed income, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television that Treasuries may have hit bottom. Barclays Plc said five-year notes were attractive given the \u201cdownside risks.\u201d\n\u201cYou do appreciate some of the stability in the market,\u201d said Vishal Khanduja, head of broader fixed-income markets at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \u201cThese yield levels are compelling for a country that is going into a slower growth environment at best.\u201d\nThere remains little doubt that Trump\u2019s shifting tariff policies are poised to exert a major drag on the economy by keeping businesses in wait-and-see mode and damping consumer confidence. Wall Street traders dazed by the rapid-fire reversals in the days since Trump\u2019s tariff announcements said they have no confidence the volatility is over with.\nThe VIX Index \u2014 known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge \u2014 remains higher than it was on April 2, even though it has pulled back from recent peaks. A similar gauge for the Treasury market points to continued volatility. The 10-day realized volatility on the S&P 500 remains at the highest since the early days of the pandemic.\nBy recent standards, though, the swings on Monday were far less jarring than last week, when the S&P 500 swung more than 10% in a single session. The S&P 500 ended the day up 0.8% after paring its gains late in the trading day.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve experienced over the last couple of weeks is it feels like the administration is trying to get its footing on its international trade policy in real time,\u201d said Keith Buchanan, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to figure out what the heck is going on.\u201d\n--With assistance from Michael Mackenzie, Isabelle Lee and Tian Chen.\n(Adds 7th paragraph to include the latest bond yields on Tuesday.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nGM\u2019s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump\u2019s America\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nCheap Consumer Goods Are the American Dream, Actually\nWorld Travelers Are Rethinking Vacation Plans to the US\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\nCandice Li says that after Washington raised tariffs on Chinese goods by 145%, U.S. orders for the medical devices her firm is making have vanished.  Li was at her firm's booth at the Canton Fair, China's biggest trade expo held twice-a-year in the southern city of Guangzhou, where more than 30,000 exhibitors showcase their products over an area larger than 200 football fields.  This was the first such fair China has held since U.S. President Donald Trump slapped tariffs in excess of 100% on China and of at least 10% on the rest of the world earlier this month.\nLVMH lost its position on Tuesday as Europe's largest luxury company in terms of market capitalization after being overtaken by rival Hermes due to investor pessimism after disappointing first-quarter revenue from the sector bellwether.  LVMH, whose high-end brands include Louis Vuitton and Dior, jewellery brand Tiffany & Co. and beauty chain Sephora, missed expectations for first-quarter sales as U.S. shoppers curbed purchases of beauty products and cognac while sales in China remained weak.  LVMH shares dropped 7%, bringing its market capitalization down to 246 billion euros, compared to 247 billion euros for Hermes.\nU.S. stocks are drifting Tuesday in a rare quiet day for financial markets.  The modest moves offer some respite following the huge swings that have battered Wall Street recently, not just day to day but also hour to hour.  The day before, the S&P 500 went from a gain of 1.8% to a slight loss and back to a gain as it struggled to keep up with shifts in President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, which economists warn could cause a global recession unless it\u2019s scaled back.\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) companies continue to pour hundreds of billions into further developing the technology and the infrastructure it requires, many investors are already looking for the next big thing.

Under the law, the Commerce Secretary is expected to deliver the results of his investigation within 270 days, though Trump and other officials have signaled these efforts could conclude more quickly.\nThe US president has long decried foreign production of drugs and chips as a threat to national security and threatened to slap tariffs on imports in a bid to revive American manufacturing of those products. But the duties could also wreak havoc on supply chains and drive up costs for Americans.\nNew levies threaten to roil a chips industry that notched more than $600 billion in global sales of semiconductors essential to products ranging from cars to airplanes and mobile phones to consumer electronics. Supply chains still feeling the effect of disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic now could face new strains from the US duties.\nThe administration\u2019s announcement came days after it exempted semiconductors, mobile phones, computers and other electronics imports from 145% duties applied to China. That announcement was seen as a boon to tech giants like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., but Trump and his advisers quickly said the relief would be short lived and that separate levies would be placed on chips.\nThe Commerce Department investigation on semiconductors is designed to have a wide range, evaluating imports of both legacy and leading-edge chips that are coveted for artificial intelligence applications. The probe will span imports of all semiconductors and the equipment used to manufacture them as well as electronic products that contain the components, according to the government notice.\nTariffs on the semiconductor sector risk affecting a wide range of companies that send billions of dollars in microprocessors and related goods to the US each year. Foreign makers of advanced chips including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and SK Hynix of South Korea could be forced to raise prices or accept smaller margins if Trump delivers on his threat of import levies.\nThe measures also threaten to impose higher costs on Trump\u2019s vision for expanding domestic semiconductor production, especially if imported chip-manufacturing equipment from companies like ASML Holding NV gets hit with tariffs. Netherlands-based ASML is a leading provider of advanced lithography machines used to produce the smallest computer chips used in AI and other sensitive applications.\nThe separate drug probe will examine imports of all pharmaceuticals \u2014 both finished generic and non-generic medicines \u2014 as well as the ingredients used to make them. Investigators also will probe imports of critical pharmaceutical inputs. The public is invited to weigh in on both probes with comments over the next 21 days.\nTariffs would also be a blow to the world\u2019s largest drugmakers, including Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly & Co., virtually all of which operate scores of manufacturing sites scattered across the globe.\nAlex Schriver, spokesman for the trade group PhRMA, said in a statement that the pharmaceutical industry shares Trump\u2019s goal of boosting US manufacturing. While he said the industry would work with the administration throughout its process, he added that \u201cmedicines have historically been excluded from tariffs because they can lead to higher costs and shortages of life-saving medicines.\u201d\nDrug companies have raced to announce major investments in the US ahead of potential tariffs. Most recently, Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG said it plans to invest $23 billion in the US over the next five years, following earlier pledges from Eli Lilly, Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson.\nBut experts warned that likely wouldn\u2019t blunt the impact of the tariffs.\n\u201cThere is no quick fix for exposed companies, in our view,\u201d Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a note to clients ahead of the announcement. \u201cRedomiciling manufacturing would take years and be very costly.\u201d\nDrugmakers will face a choice between eating the costs of potential tariffs or raising prices for their medicines in what is already the most expensive market in the world.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake politically I think for branded manufacturers to be increasing prices here,\u201d said Marta Wosi\u0144ska, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center on Health Policy. \u201cI do think there\u2019s going to be reluctance to passing through price increases.\u201d\nBecause there are some controls on the price of drugs, tariffs could end up hurting drugmakers\u2019 bottom line, leading them to scale back research, according to Lilly Chief Executive Officer Dave Ricks.\n\u201cWe have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade offs within our own companies,\u201d Ricks recently told the BBC. \u201cTypically that will be in reduction of staff or research and development (R&D) and I predict R&D will come first. That\u2019s a disappointing outcome.\u201d\nTrump, who has repeatedly bemoaned US drugmakers\u2019 reliance on overseas production, is breaking decades of tradition. The pharmaceutical industry has long side-stepped trade wars, protected by international agreements that largely protected medicines from tariffs on humanitarian grounds.\nWorldwide Impact\nTrump\u2019s move on semiconductors is similar to the way he\u2019s targeted other sectors, with imported steel, aluminum and automobiles already facing 25% tariffs and an ongoing Commerce Department trade probe expected to result in levies on foreign copper.\nUnder former President Joe Biden, the US already had doubled tariffs on so-called legacy semiconductors from China to 50% and last December launched a probe into Chinese concentration in the category that sets the stage for Trump to impose even higher levies. While not as advanced as chips driving artificial intelligence, the older technology is ubiquitous in autos, airplanes, medical devices and telecommunications.\nTrump has cast revitalizing the US chipmaking industry and industrial base as essential for the nation\u2019s security. Winning a global race to dominate the AI industry is also a top Trump administration priority. Analysts have warned that bringing chip manufacturing to the US will take years of hard work.\nThe move on medicines will have an outsize effect on Ireland, with a $54 billion (\u20ac47.6 billion) trade surplus with the US that helped spur Trump\u2019s wrath. The imbalance, heavily weighted by the pharmaceutical industry, stems from the country\u2019s favorable tax regime and highly educated workforce. US drug companies, including Lilly and Pfizer Inc., operate nearly two dozen factories in Ireland that ship to the US, according to a TD Cowen analysis.\nThe US biotech industry, which drives much of the innovation in drug development, is also vulnerable to the new tariffs. Nearly 90% of American companies rely on imported components for US-approved products, according to a recent survey by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. As a result, the supply of medicines for US patients and families are particularly vulnerable to proposed tariffs on the European Union, China and Canada, the group wrote.\nNearly all of the companies surveyed said they expect manufacturing costs to surge if import tariffs are placed on the European Union. Half of the 42 companies said they\u2019d be forced to scramble for new research and manufacturing partners or they\u2019d need to rework or potentially delay regulatory filings for new products.\n\u201cRe-onshoring key parts of the biotechnology supply chain to the U.S. and our allies and strengthening the American manufacturing base should be a high priority for both national and economic security,\u201d BIO President John Crowley said in a statement. \u201cIt will take years, though, for this shift. We need to be mindful of the negative consequences of these proposed tariffs.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s Exemptions\nThe US president earlier Monday announced he would consider temporary reprieves from his 25% tariff on automotive imports to allow companies time to bring production to the US.\nThe announcement suggested that the president was willing to negotiate with industry leaders, and a similar push from technology and pharmaceutical executives is almost certain to follow.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to get this onshoring to happen as soon as possible and as orderly as possible,\u201d Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Monday on Fox Business. \u201cAnd so when he talks to CEOs and they say, \u2018Hey, I need a little more time with this, I need a little time more more time with that,\u2019 then he\u2019s absolutely willing to listen.\u201d\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, said the administration remained focused on negotiating deals that would benefit Americans.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to start the negotiations, and just like with everyone else, I\u2019m telling them, bring your A-game. We\u2019ll see what you got, and we\u2019ll go from there,\u201d Bessent said.\nTrump was asked what short-lived product exclusions he was considering but did not specify how long a potential pause or lowering of auto levies would remain in place.\n--With assistance from Michael Shepard, Annmarie Hordern, Hadriana Lowenkron and Derek Wallbank.\n(Updates with pharmaceutical industry comment in 13th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nGM\u2019s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump\u2019s America\nCheap Consumer Goods Are the American Dream, Actually\nWorld Travelers Are Rethinking Vacation Plans to the US\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\nAuto stocks jumped on Monday afternoon after President Trump hinted tariff relief might be coming.\nTAIPEI (Reuters) -Advanced Micro Devices said on Tuesday its key processor chips would soon be made at TSMC's new production site in Arizona, marking the first time that its products will be manufactured in the United States.

See our live updates.\nSuited in variations of blue,Mark Zuckerberg took the standMonday to defend his company\u2019s past\u2014and fight for its future.\nThe CEO of Meta, Zuckerberg has helmed the company that began as Facebook for more than 20 years. Over the last decade, he\u2019s had to defend his business in Washington, D.C., plenty of times before, from the 2018 Cambridge Analytica hearings to the 2021 Congressional hearings focused on disinformation.\nBut arguably, these are the highest stakes Zuckerberg has faced so far, because what\u2019s on trial is fundamental: the composition of his sprawling $1.35 trillion market-cap business.\nThe FTC has sued Meta, arguing that the social media giant\u2019s acquisitions ofInstagramand WhatsApp more than a decade ago were anticompetitive tactics to eliminate rivals. If Meta loses the case, it could be forced to divest the two apps. The case, which has its roots in the first Trump administration and was carried on by Biden FTC chair Lina Khan, has traveled a long and winding docket (it was initially dismissed and then refiled) to finally make it to trial\u2014with Zuckerberg as the first witness.\nWhile FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson argued that \u201cconsumers do not have reasonable alternatives\u201d to Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, Zuckerberg made the case that Meta\u2019s market is far bigger (and more competitive) than the government suggests. On the stand, Zuckerberg dismissed the idea that Facebook was centered on friends, and said that the company had become \u201cmore of a broad discovery and entertainment space.\u201d\nThis case, of course, is far bigger than Meta. On some level, it\u2019s existential for the tech landscape as a whole\u2014at least, when it comes to how the industry currently operates. Whether or not the FTC\u2019s claims about Meta\u2019s anticompetitive motives are correct, the underlying business practice\u2014a tech giant swallowing up an innovative startup\u2014is the way the tech ecosystem has been structured to function, and to reward its various participants, over the past several decades.\nFor startups, especially those with limited IPO prospects, dreams of a Big Tech exit have been dim for the last several years\u2014and under the Trump administration, investors and entrepreneurs have been eagerly waiting for M&A to roar back to life.\nThere is some evidence that has been happening\u2014take, for example, Google\u2019s blowoutacquisition of Wiz for $32 billion, announced in March and the largest deal in the search giant\u2019s history. And some in Meta\u2019s camp are no doubt holding out hope that Trump will step in and pressure the FTC to settle the case with Zuckerberg (Meta hascertainly been lobbying the President).\nBut the reality is this: If Meta loses this trial, the Big Tech dealmaking that was beginning to thaw is very likely to freeze back over, affecting the whole ecosystem. For startups, the hopes of exiting to a tech giant will appear grimmer, andliquidity-starved VCswill continue to see exits stall while LPs grow increasingly impatient for returns.\nAgain, none of this is to excuse or condone the monopolistic market concentration that may have been created over time. But given the incentives that are currently built into tech, it does remain natural for giants to look for innovation by acquiring startups.\nZuckerberg is expected to take the stand again on Tuesday, and when he does, he won\u2019t just be making the case for his company. He\u2019ll be making the case for Big Tech M&A being allowed to return to its longstanding modus operandi\u2014for better or for worse.\nThis story was originally featured onFortune.com\nThe great wealth divide between the rich and the poor in the United States continues to grow and it shows no signs of slowing down. But while most Americans don't begrudge others from earning their...\nUntil excessive inequality is addressed, expect increased political violence, populism, and social unrest.\nThe stock market has always had its fair share of extra volatile periods.  Other times, these wild swings can cause poor decision-making that sets investors back.  Since President Donald Trump announced his new tariff plan on April 2 (and its subsequent changes), the stock market has been experiencing a bit of both.\nNvidia has announced plans to build its first supercomputer factories in the US as Donald Trump demands companies stop manufacturing overseas.\nThe Dow Jones rose on the stock market today and auto stocks popped after President Donald Trump spoke out.

Many of them provide website URLs and contact details for viewers to order directly from these suppliers. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just contact us and buy from us? You won\u2019t believe the prices we give you,\u201d said one creator selling luxury handbags.\nIn another video, TikTok creator @LunaSourcingChina, stands outside a factory she says makes Lululemon yoga leggings for $5 to $6 even though they retail in the US for more than $100. \u201cThe material and craftsmanship are basically the same,\u201d she says.\nA Lululemon spokesperson said the company manufactures about 3% of its finished goods in Mainland China and that authentic products are only available for purchase at Lululemon stores, official websites and authorized partners.\nSome of the most popular videos \u2013 many uploaded in March but only gaining traction in recent days \u2013 have been amplified by a video titled \u201cChina exposed the truth\u201d with 8.3 million views and 492,000 likes, as of Monday morning, New York time. The one that reveals the Chinese supplier to Lululemon garnered 2.6 million views and over 215,000 likes, while a \u201cHow we bypass tariffs\u201d clip had close to 1 million views and 118,000 likes.\n\u201cThis campaign appears to be a calculated attempt to undermine President Trump\u2019s tariff policy on China by leveraging TikTok to promote Chinese manufacturing as cheaper, more desirable, and accessible\u2014even in defiance of trade restrictions,\u201d said Alex Goldenberg, senior advisor at the Network Contagion Research Institute at Rutgers University.\nWhile it\u2019s unclear how ordering directly from Chinese suppliers would allow consumers to sidestep the tariff \u2014 the duty waiver for small parcels that are sent to American homes is also being scrapped from May 2 \u2014 the videos are aimed at undermining the White House narrative that the economic measures are in Americans\u2019 interest.\nThe levy on Chinese exports is now 145%, while Trump has paused additional tariffs on other countries for 90 days.\nThe flood of posts also reflects the increased effectiveness of Chinese creators at reaching into the daily lives of ordinary Americans. TikTok\u2019s algorithm, and its ability to influence what information millions of US users see, is one of the main driving forces behind US government efforts to force its Chinese owner ByteDance Ltd. to relinquish control of its international operations. TikTok didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOther Chinese social media apps like Xiaohongshu, or Red Note, have also gained popularity among young US users amid uncertainty around access to TikTok.\n\u201cThese posts are much more confrontational and mocking of the US, rather than showing it as a threat,\u201d said Tom Harper, lecturer in Chinese international relations at the University of East London. They follow a wave of AI-generated images depicting Americans working on assembly lines, Harper added.\nSome of the videos directly criticize US trade policies and call on American citizens to take action.\n\u201cFor decades your government and oligarchs ship your jobs to China, not for diplomacy, not for peace, but to exploit cheap labor and in the process, they hollow out your middle class, crash your working class and told you to be proud while they sold your future for profit,\u201d user @neil778027 said in a video. \u201cAmericans, you don\u2019t need a tariff, you need a revolution.\u201d\nOn Friday, the US announced tariff exemptions on a range of Chinese products including electronics, computers and semiconductors, although it\u2019s not known how long these exceptions will apply. Regardless, they will not affect most of the goods exported by China to the US, including the clothing and accessories produced by Chinese suppliers featured in the TikTok videos.\nMany European high-end luxury brands are also featured, but the makers of the videos don\u2019t explain why they are featuring European brands in their pushback against the US.\nAnother key question raised by the videos is whether the factories have non-disclosure agreements with their international clients and how the videos will potentially affect long-standing business relationships between brands and their manufacturers.\nCameron Johnson, senior partner at Shanghai-based consultancy Tidalwave Solutions, who recently visited the Chinese trading hub of Yiwu, sees it as part of a fundamental shift in purchasing practices for China.\n\u201cIn the past, you might use a middleman or a trading company to source your products for your deal with quality control or go visit the factory, establish those relationships, and then maybe you would come on occasion,\u201d he told Bloomberg TV. \u201cBut now what we\u2019re seeing is just a complete democratization of sourcing products.\u201d\n--With assistance from Annabelle Droulers, Daniela Wei, Zheping Huang and Omar El Chmouri.\n(Adds comment in seventh paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nGM\u2019s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump\u2019s America\nCheap Consumer Goods Are the American Dream, Actually\nWorld Travelers Are Rethinking Vacation Plans to the US\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n(Bloomberg) -- As China staggers into a slowdown caused by Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, a hobbled jobs market is impairing the resilience Beijing needs to battle it out against the US.Most Read from BloombergHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?The Secret Formula for Faster TrainsEven Oslo Has an Air Quality ProblemNYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing SixLisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City\u2019s Housing ShortageTrump\u2019s 145% tariffs on China\u2019s goods are threatening to\nThe Dow Jones jumped 500 points on Trump tariff news Monday.

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nWe recently published a list of10 Best Bargain Stocks to Buy in May. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best bargain stocks to buy in May.\nWhile increasing tariffs and a hard sell-off have resulted in uncertainty, Neuberger Berman, an investment manager, expects that negotiations can bring some relief to initial tariff proposals. Furthermore, the firm anticipates a sharply slower growth than a US recession. Also, it believes that stimulus in Europe and China can rejuvenate global industrial activity, and the firm recommends styles, sectors, and regions that are most geared to it.\nGiven that a significant amount of tariff shock has now been priced in, Neuberger Berman is constructive on global equities for the remainder of the year. The firm expects that an ongoing recovery in the global industrial economy might be dampened but not derailed. The underlying momentum in the goods economy is expected to support equities that are most levered to it. Furthermore, the firm prefers value over growth (which is relatively expensive) and small caps over large caps. While an overdose of growth-inhibiting policy can impact the relatively healthy economy and push it into recession, the investment management firm believes that the US hasn\u2019t yet reached that point. As per the firm, performance during the decline demonstrates relative strength in some of the more cyclical economic sectors in the US and around the world. The goods-oriented sectors, regions, and styles continue to outperform amidst the recent sell-off.\nREAD ALSO:7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Termand8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\nS&P Global expects inflation to remain closer to 3.0% in 2025 as tariffs raise the prices along the domestic supply chain as well as for the end consumers. For 2026, the firm expects growth to pick up after a slow start. This is because of the abatement of uncertainty associated with the structure of tariffs and the further easing of the policy rate by the Federal Reserve. Also, the growth is expected to be aided partly because of a more favorable growth backdrop in the eurozone, which can help expand US exports.\nNeuberger Berman opines that a combination of improving fundamentals and stabilizing risks increased the optimism in the energy sector. As per the firm, increased global industrial activity is expected to continue to buoy oil demand and keep prices aloft. Furthermore, energy seems to be the most undervalued sector in the S&P 500 relative to the current and expected earnings growth. The investment management firm believes that much of the negative news, including regulatory concerns and geopolitical risks, seem to be factored in. This suggests that energy stocks can increase as the sentiment improves.\nTo list the 10 Best Bargain Stocks to Buy in May, we used a screener to shortlist the companies that trade at a forward P/E of less than ~20.0x. Next, we chose the ones that analysts see upside to, as of April 11. We also mentioned hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q4 2024. Finally, the stocks were arranged in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\nForward P/E as of April 11: ~13.4x\nAverage Upside Potential: ~22.1%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is engaged in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. Jason Gabelman, an analyst from TD Cowen, remains optimistic about the company\u2019s stock, given its focus on maintaining a reasonable near-term valuation. This,\u00a0together with the clear pathway to FCF growth, continues to support the analyst\u2019s optimism. Furthermore, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\u2019s strategic efforts in upgrading the portfolio while, at the same time, managing its capital expenditures effectively with the help of technology-driven efficiencies and a healthy project organization cement its financial health.\u00a0Given the structural cost reductions achieved over the past few years and a commitment to value creation, the company exhibits potential for sustainable growth,\u00a0says the analyst.\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\u2019s expansion into the low-carbon power sector offers strong growth potential. With the global energy markets pivoting towards cleaner sources, its investments in this area can place it well as a leader in the energy transition. Furthermore, the diversification can result in the opening up of new revenue streams, which can attract environmentally-conscious investors and can potentially offset the risks related to the future regulations on fossil fuels.\u00a0Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) remains focused on positioning itself for future growth via strategic initiatives. It is expected to leverage synergies from its Pioneer Natural Resources acquisition.\nOverall, XOMranks 9thon our list of best bargain stocks to buy in May. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Yahoo Finance Senior ReporterAnjalee Khemlanijoins Market Domination Overtime to break down the details, as well as preview what to watch as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) prepares to report earnings.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtimehere.\nPfizer announcing today that it is halting a late stage trial of its GLP-1 pill candidate. And Yahoo! Finance's very own Angelina Kamlani joins us now with the latest, Ange.\nJosh, that's right. We heard from Pfizer today that it is choosing to halt its phase three trial of danuglipron, that is its once daily oral pill that was supposed to be a really good competitor in the market. They said that they stopped it because one of the clinical trial participants had a liver injury and after getting off the pill was able to recover. So that is where things stand. This is, you know, really a bumpy ride for Pfizer and the end to it essentially for this one molecule. We'll have to see what the company decides to do. If you take a look at the stock, though, it didn't really move much on the news today, Wall Street seemed to kind of shrug it off, and it seems that analysts are looking at maybe the company looking inwardly through its pipeline or externally to acquire something to get it into the obesity space. Uh we got Akash Tewari from Jefferies saying that we're removing danuglipron from our model and lowering the price target for Pfizer as a result from $34 to $32, and we view this as another frustrating hit to management's credibility. The company has really been under the watch of investors for some time, and you can see on your screen the struggle that it had to really enter this obesity space already, ending one candidate earlier on in June 23rd because of similar liver issues, and then looking at twice daily danuglipron having to scrap that, then advancing once daily and now scrapping that as well. That leaves Eli Lilly as the only contender in the marketplace, uh, for a pill, as well as, of course, already a market leader with the injectables. So, really hot obesity space that Pfizer is missing out on, and investors are looking at what it can do to really get the next blockbuster out of its pipeline. I guess we'll have to wait till earnings at the end of the month to hear more about that.\nAnge, healthcare is such a big business, but if you get it right, you make a lot of money. Johnson & Johnson reports earnings tomorrow. Any wisdom, what to expect?\nYeah, we're definitely keeping an eye on a few things for Johnson & Johnson. Of course, it is a maker of medical devices, which we know have been hit by the tariffs as well as a pharmaceutical manufacturing, which has been, uh, looked at as having some sort of special tariffs that we've heard from President Trump. So, we're looking on any kind of impact from those conversations, as well as broader tariff impact on guidance. We've seen a couple of companies pull, and we'll see if Johnson & Johnson does so as well. We do know the company has committed to $55 billion in US manufacturing. So we'll have to see how that all shakes out when the company, uh, lets us know tomorrow morning.\nAnge, thank you. Appreciate it.\nSeattle-based Brinc Drones, which makes remote-controlled aircraft focused on tactical and emergency response, sees a positive impact from the Trump administration's tariff policies, with their Chinese competitors getting hit by duties. China added the company to its export control list as the trade war with the US intensifies. Founder and CEO Blake Resnick speaks on \"Bloomberg: The China Show.\"\nBofA analyst Tim Anderson notes Pfizer (PFE) announced danuglipron, an oral GLP-1 obesity, is being discontinued, following a case of liver injury seen in the phase 1 study. The firm points out that it has argued that this program has received almost too much attention \u2013 not because obesity isn\u2019t important, but because this was only phase 1 data. Without danuglipron, Pfizer\u2019s obesity pipeline now consists of a GIP receptor antagonist in phase 2 and a phase 1 oral GLP-1 in T2D with Nxera Pharma.\nPresident Trump described the Russian ballistic-missile strike that killed dozens of people in the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy as \u201ca mistake.\u201d\nJohnson & Johnson is holding its earnings outlook steady despite President Donald Trump signaling he could put tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry. The administration announced earlier it would conduct an investigation into drug imports. That move is widely seen as a first step toward imposing new levies. Earnings and revenue both beat estimates for the quarter. Johnson & Johnson CFO Joe Wolk joined Bloomberg Open Interest to talk about how tariffs could hit the industry and the drug maker's bottom line.\nPfizer Inc. will stop developing an obesity pill after the treatment was linked to a potentially drug-related liver injury in a clinical trial patient. The company won't advance the once-daily medicine into the final stage of testing and will instead invest in earlier-stage treatments for obesity. Damian Garde reports on Bloomberg Television.\nGlobus Medical is gearing up for a series of product launches throughout the Musculoskeletal portfolio in the coming months of 2025.\nPfizer still has another obesity pill in development, PF-07976016, which is currently in a Phase IIa trial.\nPfizer is ending the development of its potential once-daily pill treatment for obesity before venturing into the biggest and most expensive level of clinical testing.  The drugmaker said Tuesday that it would stop studying danuglipron after a participant in one of its trials experienced a possible drug-induced liver injury that ended once the person stopped taking the treatment.  The once-daily version of the pill was in early-stage testing, with researchers trying to figure out the best dose for patients, a spokeswoman said.\nIt used to be that once you worked for 30 years at the same company and were ready to retire, you would simply punch out and collect your pension.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Bank of America Corporation (BAC), Chevron Corporation (CVX) and Stryker Corporation (SYK), as well as two micro-cap stocks Value Line, Inc. (VALU) and Sypris Solutions, Inc. (SYPR). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You cansee all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Today's Featured Research ReportsShares ofBank of Americahave gained +2.5% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry\u2019s gain of +20.4%. The company\u2019s volatile nature of the trading business is a major headwind. Despite an impressive performance since 2022, it is expected to normalize going forward. This is likely to hamper fee income growth.The Zacks analyst project non-interest income to rise only 3.4% in 2025. Continued investments in the franchise will keep the company\u2019s expenses elevated. We expect total non-interest expenses to rise 3% this year. While high funding costs are still a woe, the company\u2019s net interest income (NII) will be positively impacted by higher rates for longer.The Zacks analyst expects NII to record a CAGR of 5.3% over the next three years. Plans to open financial centers in new and existing markets and improve digital capabilities will aid the top line. We project total revenues to grow 4.8% in 2025.(You canread the full research report on Bank of America here >>>)Chevron\u2019sshares have declined -6.2% over the past six months against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry\u2019s decline of -11.9%. The company being a fully integrated energy firm, is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin.Further, the planned acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana. However, the company is grappling with high sensitivity to oil fluctuations and relatively expensive valuation.Another concern is the weak margins on refined products that forced its downstream segment to its first quarterly loss in 4 years. Considering these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.(You canread the full research report on Chevron here >>>)Shares ofStrykerhave gained +4.3% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Products industry\u2019s gain of +5.5%. The company is poised for growth, driven by rising demand for robotic-assisted procedures, hospital capital expenditures and international expansion. The Mako SmartRobotics platform fuels adoption, while acquisitions like Inari Medical and Vertos Medical enhance the portfolio.Stryker is actively integrating new technologies such as AI-driven imaging and smart surgical systems to improve patient outcomes and maintain its competitive edge. Pricing improvements and a strong hospital order book support 2025 growth.However, foreign exchange volatility and acquisition-related margin pressures may impact earnings. Supply chain disruptions and rising costs could strain profitability. Intensifying competition in robotics and MedTech demands constant innovation. Macroeconomic risks, including potential downturns in healthcare spending and regulatory shifts, add uncertainty.(You canread the full research report on Stryker here >>>)Value Line\u2019sshares have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry over the past year (+10% vs. +6.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $370.23 million have robust cash generation, with cash balances rising to $27.1 million from $6.1 million YoY, enhances liquidity and supports dividends, buybacks, and growth investments. EAM Trust income surged 47.7% to $13.8 million, driven by AUM growth to $5 billion, providing a rising, diversified passive income stream.The company maintains disciplined capital returns, paying $0.90/share in dividends and repurchasing shares, with $0.9 million authorization remaining. Portfolio gains doubled to $3.6 million, bolstering earnings. Strong branding and diversified offerings serve both retail and institutional clients, supporting market position.However, core publishing revenue declined to $26.7 million, and customer concentration (30% from one client) heightens risk. Operating costs and taxes rose, further pressuring margins, while limited international presence (~2% of revenues) increases vulnerability to U.S. market shifts.(You canread the full research report on Value Line here >>>)Shares ofSypris Solutionshave gained +3.6% over the past year against the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry\u2019s gain of +36.3%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $36.37 million benefits from an extended long-term supply agreement with a global OEM, securing stable revenues as a sole-source supplier of Ultra Axle Shafts.Sypris Solutions\u2019 diversified presence across automotive, energy, and industrial markets reduces risk and positions it to capitalize on growth trends in heavy-duty vehicles and energy infrastructure. Sypris Solutions is also aligned with growth in aerospace and defense electronics, leveraging its capabilities in high-precision components to meet rising demand. Expansion into the Asia-Pacific region aligns with high-growth markets, leveraging regional investments in defense and infrastructure.However, liquidity challenges constrain financial flexibility. Rising costs and reliance on cyclical markets such as heavy vehicles and oil and gas exacerbate margin sensitivity. Competitive pressures in aerospace further heighten vulnerability.(You canread the full research report on Sypris Solutions here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Pfizer Inc.

The company being a fully integrated energy firm, is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin.Further, the planned acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana. However, the company is grappling with high sensitivity to oil fluctuations and relatively expensive valuation.Another concern is the weak margins on refined products that forced its downstream segment to its first quarterly loss in 4 years.

The Mako SmartRobotics platform fuels adoption, while acquisitions like Inari Medical and Vertos Medical enhance the portfolio.Stryker is actively integrating new technologies such as AI-driven imaging and smart surgical systems to improve patient outcomes and maintain its competitive edge. Pricing improvements and a strong hospital order book support 2025 growth.However, foreign exchange volatility and acquisition-related margin pressures may impact earnings.

Portfolio gains doubled to $3.6 million, bolstering earnings. Strong branding and diversified offerings serve both retail and institutional clients, supporting market position.However, core publishing revenue declined to $26.7 million, and customer concentration (30% from one client) heightens risk.

While Treasuries and stocks rallied on news that President Donald Trump will delay levies on some popular consumer electronics, sentiment on the dollar was undermined by his warnings that the exemption will prove temporary.\nProtracted selloffs in the greenback and Treasuries \u2014 typically seen as havens in turbulent times \u2014 have exacerbated concerns that investors are lightening up on US assets in the face of tectonic trade policy shifts and broader political uncertainty.\nListen to the Here\u2019s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\nWeakness in the dollar and Treasuries is a \u201chorrible, toxic combination,\u201d said Jordan Rochester, head of macro strategy for EMEA at Mizuho International Plc., in an interview on Bloomberg Television.\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index finished Monday down 0.3%.

Sign up here.\nPositioning in the options market suggested traders were hedging against further declines. An index measuring three-month risk reversals \u2014 or the spread between call and put options \u2014 on the dollar against its major peers has dropped to a five-year low.\nThat indicates greater demand for put options that would benefit from a weaker dollar than for call options that would gain from a stronger one.\nThe S&P 500 index gained 0.8% on Monday. The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell 11 basis points to 4.38%. A five-day bond market selloff unleashed by anxiety over Trump\u2019s trade war sent 10-year Treasury yields to the biggest weekly surge in over two decades last week.\nLasting damage?\nThe discussion that has dominated Wall Street for much of the past week has centered on whether Trump\u2019s actions, even if they are eventually reversed, have inflicted lasting damage to the idea that the US dollar and Treasuries are the ultimate risk-free assets.\n\u201cWe are talking about a regime change in the way the market views the dollar, particularly during times of global financial stress,\u201d Steve Barrow, a strategist at Standard Bank, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019d note that the other key component of the US\u2019s safe-asset allure \u2013 the Treasury market \u2013 has not been particularly safe.\u201d\nThat view was echoed by Derek Halpenny, head of global markets research at MUFG Bank, who focused on weekend remarks from Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stressing a longstanding plan to apply a different, specific levy to the technology sector.\n\u201cIt is difficult to see any fundamental factor that will likely improve investor sentiment,\u201d Halpenny wrote in a report. \u201cKey levels were broken last week for the dollar.\u201d\nOne-week risk reversals on the Bloomberg dollar index moved toward parity for the first time in five days, a sign that traders are becoming less bearish on the greenback. Still, the gauge has remained in negative territory for a third straight day, with bearish sentiment toward the US currency at levels unseen since the pandemic.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s actions have persistently damaged the \u2018US brand\u2019,\u201d wrote Dana Malas, a strategist at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB. \u201cThis means that dollar assets, both inside and outside the US, should continue to carry higher risk premiums.\u201d\nAlmost 80% of respondents to a Bloomberg survey predicted the dollar would weaken further over the next month, the biggest proportion of bears since the surveys began in 2022.\nStrategists at the biggest Wall Street banks also see the potential for further weakness.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts suggested investors remain bearish the dollar, especially against the yen and euro, as there\u2019s still a chance of a US recession. Mizuho Bank Ltd. anticipates the US currency may fall another 5% on a trade-weighted basis before rebounding, based on how it traded in 2017-18 and during the pandemic.\n\u201cThe design and implementation of these tariffs should have a negative impact on the currency because they have contributed to eroding consumer and business confidence,\u201d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Kamakshya Trivedi wrote.\n\u201cIf tariffs weigh on US firms\u2019 profit margins and US consumers\u2019 real incomes, like we think they will, they can erode that exceptionalism and, in turn, crack the central pillar of the strong dollar,\u201d they said.\n--With assistance from Michael G.

Who will catch any tax cheats after U.S. President Donald Trump gutted the Internal Revenue Service is another question, but a relief rally limped along in Asian markets after Trump suggested he might grant exemptions on auto-related tariffs.

Trump's aggressive tariffs, which would have raised the rate consumers and businesses would have to pay for imported goods by roughly 25%, sparked a selloff in U.S. assets, including stocks, the dollar and Treasury bonds.  The shifting stances caused investors to question the safe-haven status that America has long enjoyed and sapped both business and consumer confidence.\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks ended higher on Monday, with Apple giving the S&P 500 its biggest boost as the White House exempted smartphones and computers from new tariffs.  Uncertainty over future tariffs kept a lid on optimism, with the main indexes finishing off their highs of the day.  Investors remain worried about how companies will manage supply chains as more changes are expected on the tariff front.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average increased 312 points, or 0.78%, the S&P 500 added 0.79%, and the Nasdaq picked up 0.64%.\nShares of U.S. automakers jumped on Monday amid speculation the companies could receive some relief from President Trump\u2019s 25% auto tariffs.\nIn the most recent trading session, Costco (COST) closed at $979.31, indicating a +1.65% shift from the previous trading day.\nWebull explored going public during the 2021 stock market boom, but a sharp bear market in 2022 sidelined those plans.\nWant to be a better investor?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC\u2019sSquawk on the Street, Jim Cramer suggested the recent tariffs might not simply be about economic leverage. He hinted at a deeper agenda within parts of the administration that goes beyond trade policy:\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of sense that something\u2019s going to happen that\u2019s going to take this away. In fact, just because of what we saw the other day with it going to 10 percent, I don\u2019t see that at all. I think these are very different kinds of tariffs. I mean, this is a tariff where I think there\u2019s some people with the administration who actually ultimately have a goal of regime change.\u201c\nREAD ALSO:Jim Cramer Reacts to the Surprise Market Surge and Highlights 8 Key StocksandJim Cramer Questions Market Logic and Dissects These 7 Key Stocks\nDiscussing the likelihood of a negotiated settlement between Washington and Beijing, Cramer expressed deep skepticism that China would retreat under pressure. Instead, he described a Chinese leadership that had long prepared for confrontation:\n\u201cWhen do the Chinese back down? Right now they\u2019re not, but I don\u2019t know. I think the Chinese have been ready for this since first Trump. I think that they are ready for tariffs. I think they\u2019re going to build coalitions worldwide. I do not think they\u2019re paper tigers. I think that they\u2019re a strong country and they\u2019re ready. They\u2019re ready for the fight. And I\u2019m afraid that we have many divisions that were behind enemy lines before this war started, including Apple.\u201d\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on April 11th.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(NYSE:JPM) came during a conversation about a potential recession and the pressure companies face to issue or retract forecasts. He noted that JPMorgan remains a best-in-class bank, and any temporary weakness could be a long-term buying opportunity. Here are his thoughts:\n\u201cI think in a recession you pull your forecast. And when people here pulled forecast, you just sell the stock. Now is that right? I don\u2019t think so. I think that I joke I wish actually this was the quarter where people said you know what we\u2019re not going to give guidance anymore. We\u2019re gonna be like Warren Buffett.

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nAll right, welcome. I'm Richard Stubbe, Hart Energy\u2019s senior technology editor. I'm here with Neil Modeland, who is the senior business technology development manager forHalliburton. We've been talking about the Haynesville Shale and some of the things that Halliburton brings to it and some ofthe difficulties that the shale brings here. So Neil, do you want to talk a little bit about what Halliburton is doing in the shale and why it's difficult here?\nNeil Modeland, senior business technology development manager, Halliburton: Yeah, I think if you look at the Haynesville in general, we've talked about earlier going to longer laterals and more profit intensity than really any other play in North American land. Take a step back and look at what we're doing at Halliburton. We're really trying to minimize some of the costs associated with doing those huge completions in the Haynesville. So what can we do as a frac service provider to pull out some of those costs? One of those things is electrification. So we've got our ZEUS e-fleet [electric fleet] portfolio, and 40% of our fleets in North America are actually running e-fleets.\nRS: And you said that's going up.\nNM:Yes, and in 2025 we actually expect that to end the year with 50% on that. And really all of our dedicated fleets in the Haynesville currently are e-fleets. That's really helped on driving out some of the costs on a couple of different fronts.\nOne [is] just replacing diesel with natural gas, right? You have got a lower cost commodity, and in the Haynesville we have field gas that we can actually burn to create the power generation to power the e-fleets. And that's going to be your total lowest total cost of ownership of any power generation is just burning the field gas. So we have that plentiful in the Haynesville, so that's going to lower the cost. But also the maintenance schedule and just the simplicity of the maintenance is better with our ZEUS fleet. In fact, last month our ZEUS fleets or electric fleets pumped 11% more horsepower hours on average than any of our diesel fleets. That comes because of more simplistic maintenance and just more uptime pumping these jobs and being able to do that better.\nRS: More uptime and less maintenance, that sounds like something I would also want for my car or something like that. But Halliburton is also doing a lot of work with automation, right?\nNM:Yeah. And really the e-fleets have been a good platform for that. Just the simplicity of control and then the full fleet control through our OCTIV platform has allowed us to step into automation. So last year we commercialized Auto Frac, which is really kind of push-button frac. We upload a typical frac schedule an operator would give us. We then sit down with the operator and talk through \u2018what parameters, what target pressure would you like, max rate, target rate, how would you like to ramp up the stage, how would you like to bring down the stage?\u2019 Then once all that's loaded in, it's kind of press button and here you go. So there's your automated frac. If you're riding top pressure, as your pressure breaks down, your rate will increase. That's very common in the Haynesville that we'll see that. We actually commercialized the Auto Frac in the Haynesville last year as well. To put it in perspective, the time savings we're seeing through that automation versus a manual operator, we're seeing about 10 minutes on average. In fact, the Bossier Shale versus the Haynesville Shale is a little more finicky. We actually see a closer to 15 minutes saved per stage pumping time versus a manual operator versus what we're doing with automation.\nRS: And we talked about 15 minutes, but it's 15 minutes plus 15 minutes plus times, times, times.\nNM:Yeah. 15 minutes times a hundred stages of, well, a two well pad and then several pads throughout the year, all of a sudden you have enough time to actually have that frac fleet go pump another well or two right by the end of the year.\nRS: Well fantastic. Thank you for being here and talking with us, and I really appreciate you just being part of the program.\nNM:My pleasure. Thanks for having.\nRS: Thank you.\nThe independent specialty grocer sticks to its roots at its newest store in Washington, D.C.\u2019s Van Ness neighborhood, an area that caters to students and families alike.\nThe policy would \"devastate scientific research,\u201d according to the plaintiffs, which include the American Council on Education and Brown University.\nApplied Digital Corporation (APLD) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of -45.45% and 16.75%, respectively, for the quarter ended February 2025.

Despite this launch, Nike's share price dipped 2.2% over the past week, a movement contrasting with the broader market\u2019s 5.8% gain. This slight decline in Nike's price might not align with the broader market trend influenced by external factors, such as overall market optimism from major tech stocks rallying on tariff exemption news, which appeared to influence broader market sentiment more positively.\nBuy, Hold or Sell NIKE? View our complete analysis and fair value estimate and you decide.\nFind companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value.\nThe recent collaboration between Nike and Kool-Aid, featuring the vibrant Nike x Kool-Aid Ja 2 sneaker, may add fresh appeal to Nike's product lineup. This partnership aligns with Nike's strategy to enhance brand storytelling and leverage sports performance dimensions as growth drivers. Although the share price fell 2.2% recently, this may be a short-term fluctuation possibly reflecting external market conditions rather than an immediate impact of the collaboration. Over a longer period of five years, Nike's total shareholder return, which includes share price and dividends, was a decline of 34.31%, underscoring challenges the company has faced in maintaining upward momentum.\nCompared to the past year, Nike's performance has lagged behind both the US Market and the broader Luxury industry, which are indicators of the competitive and economic pressures it encounters. Analysts predict a modest revenue growth of around 1.9% annually, alongside a slight increase in profit margins to 9.9% within three years. However, for Nike to meet the consensus price target of US$78.49, the stock would need to see a significant increase from its current trading price of US$53.27, indicating a trading discount of about 33.4% against the target. The Kool-Aid collaboration may help boost revenue and support these forecasts by enhancing brand engagement and driving full-price sales, aiding in net margin improvements and inventory turnover.\nEvaluate NIKE's historical performance by accessing our past performance report.\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.We provide commentary based on historical data and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your financial situation.

This move was primarily due to safety concerns in clinical studies. Despite achieving key pharmacokinetic goals, the discovery of a potential drug-induced liver injury prompted Pfizer to reassess its strategy. This decision adds weight to the company's stock performance, contrasting with broader market trends, where major indexes experienced upward movement amidst tariff-related developments and positive gains in tech sectors. Pfizer's decision highlights the importance of rigorous safety evaluations in pharmaceutical developments.\nWe've discovered 3 warning signs for Pfizer (2 are significant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\nExplore 22 top quantum computing companies leading the revolution in next-gen technology and shaping the future with breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, superconducting qubits, and cutting-edge research.\nThe cessation of Danuglipron\u2019s development could significantly influence Pfizer's revenue and earnings forecasts moving forward. By prioritizing rigorous safety measures, Pfizer may face setbacks in accelerating R&D productivity and the associated revenue streams. This shift may lead to a more conservative approach in pipeline-driven growth expectations and could delay anticipated financial impacts from new products, potentially further pressuring revenue forecasts already impacted by legislative changes. The development halt aligns with observed market volatility around Pfizer shares, shedding light on investor concerns regarding the company's future earning capabilities amidst evolving challenges in the pharmaceutical sector.\nOver the past year, Pfizer's total return, including dividends, was a 10.14% decline, signaling underperformance relative to both the broader market and the US Pharmaceuticals industry, which experienced negative returns of 8.6%. During this period, the company's earnings showed considerable growth from a very low base, yet they have not matched market expectations overall. Notably, analysts have set a fair value price target of US$26.02, suggesting upside potential compared to the current share price of US$22.49.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s radar.\nOn Thursday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer cautioned viewers about what may lie ahead once the 90-day pause on new tariffs comes to an end. While discussing the latest Consumer Price Index report, Cramer acknowledged that the numbers looked favorable, with inflation appearing relatively tame and even some categories experiencing actual price declines. He pointed to energy prices, saying, \u201cThe best, anything it touched energy, which is plummeting.\u201d\nREAD ALSO:Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocksand10 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar Recently.\n\u201cThis is essentially an embargo. President Trump\u2019s ecstatic that the tariffs are already taking in $2 billion a day. He\u2019s thrilled that supposedly 75 countries are begging for something more reasonable than the 90-day pause when the 90-day pause comes to an end.\u201d\nAccording to Cramer, President Trump is \u201cecstatic\u201d that these tariffs are already generating $2 billion a day in revenue and is thrilled about 75 countries \u201csupposedly\u201d asking for something more workable once the 90-day grace period concludes. Despite the seemingly positive revenue flow, Cramer expressed concern over the broader consequences. He pointed out that many Americans have yet to grasp the full impact of trade policies that have allowed foreign businesses to flood U.S. markets with inexpensive products, often pricing out domestic companies.\nWhile many consumers embraced the lower costs, Cramer reminded his audience that it came at the expense of American jobs. \u201cNow we\u2019re going to have to pay a price. He stressed that consumers should be prepared to pay significantly more for a wide range of goods. He said that the additional cost largely will likely benefit foreign companies, which will hike prices in response to the tariffs imposed on them. He clarified his position by stating he is not a staunch advocate of free trade for its own sake. \u201cNo other country plays by the rules on trade, so we shouldn\u2019t either,\u201d he said but cautioned:\n\u201cWe just have to be more thoughtful about this or we\u2019ll end up doing more harm than good. Again, as someone who wants fair trade, not free trade, I am rooting for the president to pull this off, but not at the expense of great American companies that have done nothing wrong and are the best in the world.\u201d\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA medical technician wearing protective gloves and a mask mixing a biopharmaceutical solution.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 92\nA caller asked if Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was a buy or not and Cramer remarked:\n\u201cWell, let me tell you something\u2026 right now, we have a government that is trying to figure out whether it\u2019s going to tax the heck out of drug companies, raise tariffs outta drug companies or not. I can\u2019t make a prediction anymore. It yields 8%. Normally I say fine, but you know what? Let\u2019s say you decide, you know what, we need big tariffs on Pfizer. You\u2019ll say, wow, I\u2019m buying that stock at 18 rather than 21. So I\u2019m going to have to say, pass.\u201d\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) focuses on discovering, creating, manufacturing, and supplying biopharmaceutical products. Its work covers areas such as heart health, infectious illness, cancer treatment, immune system conditions, and vaccines. On March 31, Cramer said:\n\u201cIs Pfizer dead money? I mean I think it\u2019s been mummified. I don\u2019t know. I mean it\u2019s like, wow. Look at that thing. Close the casket\u2026 Alright, Pfizer is unfortunately dead money. Dr. Bourla\u2019s a terrific guy\u2026 what can I say? He\u2019s a terrific guy. He\u2019s a terrific guy.\u201d\nOverall, PFEranks 1ston our list of stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s radar. While we acknowledge the potential of PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

In one of these studies, an asymptomatic patient experienced a potential drug-induced liver injury. The injury resolved after drug discontinuation; however, Pfizer has decided, based on this event, available clinical data, and recent input from regulators to discontinue the development of the drug. The therapy has been investigated in a total of 1,400 patients.\nChief scientific officer and president of R&D at Pfizer, Dr. Chris Boshoff said: \u201cWhile we are disappointed to discontinue the development of danuglipron, we remain committed to evaluating and advancing promising programs in an effort to bring innovative new medicines to patients.\u201d\nPfizer will be presenting data from the studies at an upcoming medical conference and peer-reviewed journal.\nUnlike some of its big pharma competitors, Pfizer has not had much luck in the obesity pill space. In December 2023, the company stopped the development of the twice-daily version of danuglipron due tohigh rates of gastrointestinal side effects. This came six months after the company hadculled another oral GLP-1-RA candidate, lotiglipron, due to associated high transaminase levels.\nThe company still has another oral obesity candidate in trials, a once daily glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor antagonist, PF-07976016. The therapy is being investigated in a Phase IIa trial (NCT06717425), which was initiated in December 2024.\nPfizer faces fierce competition in the obesity space, especially from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, both of which have cemented a reputation with their subcutaneous GLP-1RA therapies Wegovy (semaglutide) and Zepbound (tirzepatide), respectively.\nEli Lilly is also looking to enter the oral obesity space and is running a Phase III programme of its daily pill orforglipron. GlobalData predicts sales of orforglipron to reach $11.8bn in 2030.\nGlobalDatais the parent company ofClinical Trials Arena.\nBiotechs are also making headway in the obesity arena. Viking Therapeutics is studying an oral version of the weight loss therapy VK2735 in an ongoing Phase II study (NCT06828055), and its subcutaneous formulation is set to enter a Phase III trial in Q2 2025.\nPfizer\u2019s stock, listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), remains stable despite the danuglipron announcement. Meanwhile, Viking\u2019s stock, listed on the Nasdaq exchange, jumped by 21% at market open today (14 April).\nThe gold standard of business intelligence.\nFind out more\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\nVisit ourPrivacy Policyfor more information about our services, how we may use, process and share your personal data, including information on your rights in respect of your personal data and how you can unsubscribe from future marketing communications.

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nDividendinvesting has long been a favored strategy for those seeking passive income and long-termwealthgrowth.\nUnlike depending solely on capital appreciation, dividend-paying stocks and funds provide regular cash payouts, allowing investors to compound their returns by reinvesting dividends or using them to cover expenses. Many investors are drawn to dividends because they offer a tangible return, namely getting paid simply for holding shares.\nDon't Miss:\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share.\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\nA disciplined strategy that entails buying consistently, reinvesting dividends, often through dividend reinvestment plans, and holding for the long term can turn even modest monthly contributions into a notable income stream over time. This strategy, often called the \u201csnowball effect,\u201d leverages compounding to boost portfolio growth.\nOne investor who has adopted this method is a 34-year-old Reddit user who has grown his portfolio to $114,000 in just five years by investing as much as he could through a dividend reinvestment plan. In turn, his portfolio is now generating $700 to $800 in monthly dividends. His goal is to eventually live off his dividend income while continuing to grow his investments.\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nThe investor keeps this portfolio in a taxable brokerage account for flexibility, allowing him to access the dividends if needed, although he mentioned that wasn't the case so far.\n\u201cI\u2019m planning on retiring in 15 years. My next goal is $1,000 a month. I'm in the process of growing a business and it would be nice to be able to pay a couple of bills with my dividends if I ever need to (hasn't happened yet). I'm much more likely to save and reinvest every month because I get paid every month, how fun is that? It doesn't have to be the most optimal but it's definitely great motivation to keep the snowball rolling,\u201d he wrote on Reddit.\nThe investor's portfolio consists of three key ETFs, each offering a different mix of income and growth. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each below.\nSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF\nSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE:SCHD) is a passively managed ETF that tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. It focuses on high-quality U.S. companies with strong dividend histories and solid fundamentals like consistent cash flow and strong balance sheets. SCHD is loved by investors because it has a long-term performance, a low expense ratio, and a long, solid history. The ETF generates approximately 4.22% in dividend yield per year.\nSee Also: It\u2019s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $250 million in art \u2014this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here\u2019s how everyday investors are getting started.\nJPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF\nJPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSE:JEPI) combines equity investing with an options overlay strategy. It holds U.S. large-cap stocks and writes covered calls to generate extra income. This creates a high-yielding, lower-volatility product while also maintaining some exposure to stock appreciation. It's ideal for investors seeking above-average yields with lower volatility than pure equity funds. JEPI pays investors around 8.14% in dividends per year.\nJPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF\nJPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ)\u200b is similar to JEPI but focused on Nasdaq-100 stocks. The ETF combines growth tech exposure with income generation through options strategies, making it riskier due to its tech concentration and shorter track record. JEPQ also uses covered calls for income, making it a high-yield ETF with exposure to growth sectors. Investors get paid around 11.94% in annual dividends.\nRead Next:\nCan you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg?The percentage may shock you.\n\u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.Click now to get top trade ideas daily, plus unlimited access to cutting-edge tools and strategies to gain an edge in the markets.\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis articleFrom $0 To $114K In 5 Years: 34-Year-Old Investor Says 'I Buy As Much As I Can Every Month' \u2013 Aims To Live Off Dividends, Shares Top 3 Picksoriginally appeared onBenzinga.com\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nMomentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\nBelow, we take a look atUnitedHealth Group (UNH), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. UnitedHealth Group currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for UNH that show why this largest U.S. health insurer shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\nFor UNH, shares are up 14.17% over the past week while the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry is up 1.21% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 22.68% compares favorably with the industry's 2.76% performance as well.\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of UnitedHealth Group have risen 17.6%, and are up 36.49% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved -7.64% and 4.64%, respectively.\nInvestors should also pay attention to UNH's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. UNH is currently averaging 5,807,295 shares for the last 20 days.\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with UNH.\nOver the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost UNH's consensus estimate, increasing from $29.63 to $29.73 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that UNH is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep UnitedHealth Group on your short list.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) jumped 2.75%, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) rose 2.27% , and Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX) soared nearly 20% in the premarket trading at the same timeall riding momentum from stronger weight-loss offerings. Lilly's Zepbound, a once-weekly injectable, is already generating nearly $5 billion a year and has an oral version in the final stretch of trials. Structure Therapeutics and AstraZeneca aren't far behind, with their own oral contenders in the pipeline.\nThis misstep throws more heat on Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who's under pressure to offset looming patent cliffs that could wipe out $15 billion in revenue by decade's end. So far, the pipeline hasn't delivered, and the M&A spree hasn't produced a clear winner. As competitors rack up approvals and market share, Pfizer may have to rethink its next moveand fast. Investors will be watching closely to see if another round of strategic acquisitions is in the cards.\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus.\nPfizer  is halting development of its experimental weight-loss pill, as the booming obesity drug market remains out of reach for the drug giant.  The company said Monday the stoppage comes after it reviewed clinical data and a study subject developed a liver injury that might have been caused by the drug, called danuglipron.  Halting the drug\u2019s development means  Pfizer  still is unable to get a cut, for now, of the white-hot obesity market, which analysts say could reach $100 billion by the end of the decade.\nSigns of potential liver damage in a study participant led the company to abandon danuglipron, a drug it hoped would help it break into the highly lucrative market for obesity drugs.\nPfizer (PFE) announced Monday that it is ending development of its daily weight-loss pill following a liver injury to a patient participating in a trial.\nThe drugmaker said one patient became ill after being treated with its experimental weight-loss drug, danuglipron.\nPfizer said it will stop development of an oral weight-loss pill after a participant taking the drug in a clinical trial experienced a \"liver injury.\"\nPfizer bows, but is not entirely out of the GLP-1 race.\nBarclays Bank offers high-yield online savings accounts and CDs.

Shares of companies will injectable GLP-1 drugs already on the market -- Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk -- gained 2% and 2.7%, respectively, through 10:30 a.m. ET. Viking Therapeutics, which does not yet have a GLP-1 drug on the market (but like Pfizer, was racing to put one there) surged most of all, gaining 9.9% on the prospect that now Viking, and not Pfizer, may end up being the third major player in this weight loss drug market.\nIn its press release this morning, Pfizer explained that while danuglipron exhibited the \"potential to deliver a competitive efficacy and tolerability profile\" to existing GLP-1 drugs, \"a single asymptomatic participant in one of the dose-optimization studies experienced potential drug-induced liver injury,which resolved after discontinuation of danuglipron\" (emphasis added). This was a strong hint that it was the drug at fault for the negative effect, and it convinced Pfizer to terminate further development.\nPfizer expressed disappointment at the need to discontinue the development of danuglipron, but insisted the company remains \"committed to evaluating and advancing promising programs,\" including in the weight loss market. But for now at least, it's no longer anywhere near the front of the pack in this race.\n(Pfizer stock was down 1.2% in the same time frame, by the way).\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThe implications for Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk seem pretty clear: The immediate removal of a rival for the massive revenues they've been raking in from the GLP-1 market, which helped lift Lilly past $45 billion in total revenue last year, and pushed Novo past $44 billion.\nAdding toLilly's good news, investment bank Guggenheim this morning lowered its price target on the stock, butreiterated its buy rating. As the analyst explained, Lilly has a near-term catalyst that could drive the stock higher: Q1 earnings come out on May 1. And Guggenheim says that analyst forecasts for the company to earn $4.2 billion on just $12.8 billion in revenue (according to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence) look \"comfortably achievable.\"\nSeparately, investment bankJPMorgancommented this morning that Pfizer's discontinuation of danuglipron is \"mostly a positive\" for Viking Therapeutics and its VK2735 GLP-1 weight loss drug currently under development, making the company an \"even more attractive partnership candidate\" for alarger pharmaceutical companyto team up with.\nJPMorgan also urged investors to take a closer look atStructure Therapeutics(GPCR-0.95%)and its own ACCG-2671 GLP-1 weight loss drug (another stock that was up today), which JPMorgan says is now in line to become the second small molecule oral to enter the market.\nGranted, like Viking, Structure is not yet a profitable company. But at a $1 billion market cap, it's less than half the cost of Viking stock -- and apparently closer to market as well!\nFor investors looking for surer bets in the GLP-1 market, they should probably stick with Novo Nordisk or Lilly. Both stocks are solidly profitable, with Lilly posting thefaster growth rate, but Novo Nordisk -- selling for less than 20 times trailing earnings -- looks significantly cheaper than Lilly at aP/E ratioof more than 62.\nBefore you buy stock inViking Therapeutics, consider this:\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 andViking Therapeuticswasn\u2019t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s radar.\nOn Thursday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer cautioned viewers about what may lie ahead once the 90-day pause on new tariffs comes to an end. While discussing the latest Consumer Price Index report, Cramer acknowledged that the numbers looked favorable, with inflation appearing relatively tame and even some categories experiencing actual price declines. He pointed to energy prices, saying, \u201cThe best, anything it touched energy, which is plummeting.\u201d\nREAD ALSO:Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocksand10 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar Recently.\n\u201cThis is essentially an embargo. President Trump\u2019s ecstatic that the tariffs are already taking in $2 billion a day. He\u2019s thrilled that supposedly 75 countries are begging for something more reasonable than the 90-day pause when the 90-day pause comes to an end.\u201d\nAccording to Cramer, President Trump is \u201cecstatic\u201d that these tariffs are already generating $2 billion a day in revenue and is thrilled about 75 countries \u201csupposedly\u201d asking for something more workable once the 90-day grace period concludes. Despite the seemingly positive revenue flow, Cramer expressed concern over the broader consequences. He pointed out that many Americans have yet to grasp the full impact of trade policies that have allowed foreign businesses to flood U.S. markets with inexpensive products, often pricing out domestic companies.\nWhile many consumers embraced the lower costs, Cramer reminded his audience that it came at the expense of American jobs. \u201cNow we\u2019re going to have to pay a price. He stressed that consumers should be prepared to pay significantly more for a wide range of goods. He said that the additional cost largely will likely benefit foreign companies, which will hike prices in response to the tariffs imposed on them. He clarified his position by stating he is not a staunch advocate of free trade for its own sake. \u201cNo other country plays by the rules on trade, so we shouldn\u2019t either,\u201d he said but cautioned:\n\u201cWe just have to be more thoughtful about this or we\u2019ll end up doing more harm than good. Again, as someone who wants fair trade, not free trade, I am rooting for the president to pull this off, but not at the expense of great American companies that have done nothing wrong and are the best in the world.\u201d\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA row of factory workers assembling bottles of sparkling soft drinks on a conveyor belt.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\nA caller asked what Cramer thought of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and he replied:\n\u201cI love that\u2026. James Quincey is terrific. It\u2019s got a good dividend. It\u2019s really well run. It\u2019s got an international presence\u2026 and it\u2019s doing well in this environment. You have a winner.\u201d\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that offers a wide variety of nonalcoholic drinks. Its products include soft drinks, water, tea, juice, plant-based options, concentrates, and syrups for retail use. In February, Cramer said:\n\u201c\u2026 Sometimes companies can practically print money simply because they\u2019re so well run. Take Coca-Cola. Under the steady hand of James Quincey, Coca-Cola has become a low-risk juggernaut with a solid dividend, definitely a stock that is worth owning.\u201d\nOverall, KOranks 3rdon our list of stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s radar. While we acknowledge the potential of KO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

And it starts with artificial intelligence taking center stage. Nadella believes the company is about to launch something as revolutionary as Excel or PowerPoint once were: its AI assistant, Copilot.\nNadella recently sat down withGeekWireto reflect on the company\u2019s evolution.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against other best dividend-paying stocks.\nDividend-paying stocks have consistently attracted investor interest due to their long-term value. CNBC highlights this by examining the historical performance of the broader market. Between 1960 and 2024, a $10,000 investment in the index would have grown to over $982,000 purely from stock price appreciation, based on data from FactSet and NYU Stern. However, many companies in the index also returned capital to shareholders through dividends. Had an investor reinvested those dividends over the years, the investment would have ballooned to approximately $6.42 million by the beginning of 2025.\nThis outlook seems reasonable, especially when considering how crucial cash flow has become in today\u2019s economic environment. Investors continue to favor income-generating assets, and dividends remain one of the most reliable ways to deliver that income. Reflecting this trend, several companies within the market have recently introduced dividend payments.\nAccording to S&P Global, companies in the S&P index now contribute roughly 85% of the total dividends paid across the market\u2014up from 82% in 2024. This increase includes 2.7% of the total dividend pool coming from firms that only recently began issuing dividends. The top 29 companies in the index alone are responsible for 40% of all dividends paid by the index\u2019s constituents and 35% of the total dividends across the entire US equity market. Under the current base-case forecast, these leading firms are expected to distribute a combined $280 billion in dividends. In a more optimistic (upside) scenario, that figure could climb by 2.75% to $288 billion, with major large cap companies projected to deliver the most significant gains by weighted average. If the most favorable (bull-case) conditions materialize, these 29 companies could boost total dividend payouts by an estimated 4.5%, contributing an additional 1% themselves.\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that dividends have become a central theme in many investors\u2019 strategies. According to Brian Bollinger, founder of Simply Safe Dividends, focusing on companies that regularly pay dividends can offer a sense of reassurance. He further noted that younger investors, in particular, have the opportunity to build long-term dividend growth portfolios aimed at maximizing total return and capital appreciation over time.\nAccording to Nuveen, companies that focus on dividend growth tend to possess strong long-term fundamentals and may deliver relatively attractive performance in the year ahead. Historically, firms that consistently increased or initiated dividend payments have produced higher annualized returns and exhibited lower volatility compared to the broader equity market. While such companies may not lead in every market environment, their favorable risk-adjusted returns over extended periods make them a solid foundation for equity portfolios.\nNuveen also suggested that many firms remain in a strong position to continue raising dividends over time. In the US, corporate balance sheets are generally healthy, consumer spending remains steady, and earnings growth is projected to pick up pace in 2025. Data from FactSet shows that dividends per share for the S&P index rose by 7.6% in 2024, with consensus forecasts pointing to a further 4.2% increase in 2025. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\nA group of business people discussing plans around a boardroom table adorned with a financial services company logo.\nOur Methodology:\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of the close of Q4 2024. From the top 60 companies, we selected 11 dividend stocks with yields of at least 1% as of April 12. These companies show strong financial performance and have solid records of paying dividends. The stocks are ranked according to the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 123\nAn American multinational financial services and banking company, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) ranks third on our list of the best dividend-paying stocks according to hedge funds. The company operates across multiple key sectors of the financial industry. It owns a major bank that caters to both consumers and businesses, runs an investment banking division that assists companies in raising capital, and manages a wealth management arm that oversees investments for high-net-worth clients. Except for insurance, these operations cover all major areas of the finance sector.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) delivered strong financial results, with net income surging 50% to $14 billion and net revenue climbing 10% to $43.7 billion. Although net interest income dipped 3% to $23.5 billion, noninterest revenue saw a notable 29% jump, reaching $20.3 billion. Operating expenses declined 7% to $22.8 billion, but when adjusted for the prior year\u2019s $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment, they actually rose 5%, reflecting increased spending on compensation, brokerage fees, and technology. The bank also set aside $2.6 billion for credit losses, with net charge-offs rising to $2.4 billion, mainly due to higher losses in its Card Services division.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) offers a quarterly dividend of $1.40 per share, having raised it by 12% in March. In addition to dividend growth, it also returned $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends in the most recent quarter. The stock supports a dividend yield of 2.37%, as of April 12.\nOverall, JPMranks 3rdon our list of the best dividend paying stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of JPM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best dividend-paying stocks.\nDividend-paying stocks have consistently attracted investor interest due to their long-term value. CNBC highlights this by examining the historical performance of the broader market. Between 1960 and 2024, a $10,000 investment in the index would have grown to over $982,000 purely from stock price appreciation, based on data from FactSet and NYU Stern. However, many companies in the index also returned capital to shareholders through dividends. Had an investor reinvested those dividends over the years, the investment would have ballooned to approximately $6.42 million by the beginning of 2025.\nThis outlook seems reasonable, especially when considering how crucial cash flow has become in today\u2019s economic environment. Investors continue to favor income-generating assets, and dividends remain one of the most reliable ways to deliver that income. Reflecting this trend, several companies within the market have recently introduced dividend payments.\nAccording to S&P Global, companies in the S&P index now contribute roughly 85% of the total dividends paid across the market\u2014up from 82% in 2024. This increase includes 2.7% of the total dividend pool coming from firms that only recently began issuing dividends. The top 29 companies in the index alone are responsible for 40% of all dividends paid by the index\u2019s constituents and 35% of the total dividends across the entire US equity market. Under the current base-case forecast, these leading firms are expected to distribute a combined $280 billion in dividends. In a more optimistic (upside) scenario, that figure could climb by 2.75% to $288 billion, with major large cap companies projected to deliver the most significant gains by weighted average. If the most favorable (bull-case) conditions materialize, these 29 companies could boost total dividend payouts by an estimated 4.5%, contributing an additional 1% themselves.\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that dividends have become a central theme in many investors\u2019 strategies. According to Brian Bollinger, founder of Simply Safe Dividends, focusing on companies that regularly pay dividends can offer a sense of reassurance. He further noted that younger investors, in particular, have the opportunity to build long-term dividend growth portfolios aimed at maximizing total return and capital appreciation over time.\nAccording to Nuveen, companies that focus on dividend growth tend to possess strong long-term fundamentals and may deliver relatively attractive performance in the year ahead. Historically, firms that consistently increased or initiated dividend payments have produced higher annualized returns and exhibited lower volatility compared to the broader equity market. While such companies may not lead in every market environment, their favorable risk-adjusted returns over extended periods make them a solid foundation for equity portfolios.\nNuveen also suggested that many firms remain in a strong position to continue raising dividends over time. In the US, corporate balance sheets are generally healthy, consumer spending remains steady, and earnings growth is projected to pick up pace in 2025. Data from FactSet shows that dividends per share for the S&P index rose by 7.6% in 2024, with consensus forecasts pointing to a further 4.2% increase in 2025. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\nOur Methodology:\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of the close of Q4 2024. From the top 60 companies, we selected 11 dividend stocks with yields of at least 1% as of April 12. These companies show strong financial performance and have solid records of paying dividends. The stocks are ranked according to the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\nAn American multinational oil and gas company, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is a global leader in integrated energy and chemical operations, ranks at the top of the best oil and gas dividend stocks to consider. In Q4 2024, the company reported a revenue of $83.4 billion, reflecting a slight 1.1% dip from the previous year. Despite this, its long-term performance remained steady, supported by $12.1 billion in structural cost savings since 2019. These efforts have helped offset inflation and expansion costs while enabling it to outperform industry peers. For 2024, the company recorded a sector-leading return on capital employed at 12.7%, with a five-year average of 10.8%.\nWith a strong cash flow position, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands out as a reliable dividend payer. It generated $55 billion in operating cash flow during 2024, marking its third-strongest year in the past decade. For Q4 alone, operating cash flow reached $12.2 billion, while free cash flow totaled $8 billion. The company returned $36 billion to shareholders in 2024, including $16.7 billion in dividend payments.\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) boasts a rich dividend legacy, having paid shareholders for 143 consecutive years and growing its dividend consistently for the past 42 years. Currently, it pays a quarterly dividend of $0.99 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.84%, as of April 12.\nOverall, XOMranks 6thon our list of the best dividend paying stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.\nThe market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump\u2019s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year.\nThe year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios.\nIn the second month of 2025, the US government\u2019s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States\u2019 tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services.\nDW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods & services in the latest round of \u201cTrump Tariffs\u201d. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering \u201ccontinuous stagflation\u201d, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment.\nThis scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children\u2019s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children\u2019s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President & CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing:\n\u201cMake sure that money can be talked about, that there\u2019s no taboos\u2026so that your children are learning those really good financial literacy skills that they need to set themselves up for success for the rest of their life.\u201d\nInvesting in the markets for your children\u2019s future has the advantage of time. In a report by MorningStar, investments in stocks have the added benefit of compounding return, which means the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to grow exponentially. CNBC reported on billionaire investor Mark Cuban and how he made billions from his first few million with a long-term view on his investments.\nTo compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources and gathered the stocks they collectively favored. These stocks have a long-standing history of performance, with strong balance sheets and sound financials. Then, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s proprietary database of billionaire stock holdings to arrive at our list of 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires as of Q4 2024. For the stocks with the same number of billionaire holdings, we have used the total value of billionaire holdings as a secondary metric to rank the stocks. Billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world\u2019s leading hedge funds and companies.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of trainers and athletes displaying a wide range of athletic and casual footwear.\nNo. of Billionaires: 14\nValue of total Investment by Billionaires: $3.095 billion\nNIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a global leader in the athletic goods industry. The company designs, develops, markets, and sells a wide range of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services worldwide under prominent brands such as NIKE, Jumpman, Converse, and Chuck Taylor. These brands are considered household names for both children & parents/ adults alike.\nIn the Q3 2025 earnings report, NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) revenue was $11.27 billion, down 9.33% YoY, although beating analyst estimates by $231.5 million. EPS was $0.54, also beating estimates by $0.25. The company attributes the decline in sales to rising inflation, high tariffs but remains a market leader in high-quality athletic goods. It is among the best kid-friendly stocks to invest in.\nRecent declines in international markets such as the Middle East, Europe, and Asia (including China & Vietnam) were the result of reduced buying by price-conscious consumers. As per the United States International Trade Commission (USITC), China is the largest importer of shoes from the United States at 37%, while Vietnam is responsible for 29.8%. China was hit with the aforementioned 34% trade tariffs, while Vietnam was hit even harder with 46%. This is likely to further impact NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE)\u2019s overall revenue figure. Experts consider these conditions as an optimal time to invest in the stock to take advantage of the lower price.\nOverall, NKEranks 6thon our list of best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of NKE, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, described the 145% duty on China as so extreme that it essentially acts as an embargo rather than a conventional tariff.\n\u201cWe now have 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, a number that high frankly isn\u2019t really a tariff. It\u2019s more of an embargo. Almost nobody\u2019s gonna pay that much of a markup. It\u2019s a recipe for losing money.\u201d\nREAD ALSO10 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar RecentlyandJim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks\nCramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump\u2019s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. \u201cAs a nation, shamefully, we\u2019ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,\u201d he said\n\u201cI think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.\u201d\nCramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. \u201cYes, we have to take them on now or never,\u201d he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept.\n\u201cSo the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it\u2019s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it\u2019s not worth it to go back\u2026 [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I\u2019m actually thinking that might be where we\u2019\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 150\nCommenting on how people are investing in light of tariffs, Cramer mentioned UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) and said:\n\u201cIs the market reflecting any of this? No, but something else is happening too. People are investing in companies, just started yesterday, that don\u2019t have all that much exposure to China or none. You can see it in healthcare, excluding drugs, which are still facing the possibility of their own set of tariffs. UnitedHealth Group and Humana are good examples. They were up once again. I mean it\u2019s really incredible. Former up nearly 3%, The latter up 2%.\u201d\nUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is a healthcare company that provides health benefit plans, care delivery, pharmacy services, and health management programs. It supplies software, consulting, and data products to businesses in the healthcare industry.\nParnassus Investmentsstated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in itsQ4 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe sold two Health Care positions during the quarter, pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and insurerUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). UnitedHealth\u2019s business model is becoming higher-risk, which coupled with slowing Medicare Advantage growth and regulatory uncertainty led to us exiting the position.\nOverall, UNHranks 2ndon our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

However, the trends in March are not so different from what's happening now, as consumer sentiment was rapidly weakening and fears of a recession were mounting before thetariffannouncement.\nLet's take a look at the two best-performingDow Jones Industrial Average(^DJI-0.30%)companies to see if they're worth buying today.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nUnitedHealth Group(UNH-0.62%)is one of the most resilient stocks on the market.

However, the trends in March are not so different from what's happening now, as consumer sentiment was rapidly weakening and fears of a recession were mounting before thetariffannouncement.\nLet's take a look at the two best-performingDow Jones Industrial Average(^DJI-0.40%)companies to see if they're worth buying today.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nUnitedHealth Group(UNH-0.50%)is one of the most resilient stocks on the market. Healthcare is considered a recession-proof industry, but health insurance is even more unaffected by the economy because people need coverage regardless.\nIt's not a surprise, then, that investors have piled into the stock in March and have continued to do so through the tariff-related chaos of April.\nThere was no major company-specific news out on UnitedHealth in March, and investors seem to be returning to the stock after it tumbled following the assassination of one of its executives in December 2024.\nUnitedHealth has been one of the rare winners on the stock market in April, gaining 15% thanks to a 5.06% increase in Medicare Advantage benchmarks and its reputation as a port in a storm during turbulent market times.\nChevron(CVX-0.52%)might seem like a surprise on this list as the energy sector is typically highly sensitive to the economic cycle.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best technology dividend stocks.\nThere was a time when tech stocks drew investor interest purely for their growth potential. But more recently, they\u2019ve been gaining attention for a different reason: dividends. This marks a major shift, given that tech companies have traditionally focused their resources on innovation and expansion. Today, a significant portion of the tech sector consists of established firms with solid business models, healthy margins, steady growth, strong financials, and manageable debt levels. According to S&P, about 39% of tech companies in the Composite 1500 index are now returning capital to shareholders through dividends\u2014a notable jump from 28% back in 2013.\nIn addition, technology stocks have emerged as a major contributor to the market\u2019s overall dividend payouts. FactSet data showed that tech companies now account for around 13% of the total dollar value of dividends within the S&P Composite Index. That puts the tech sector just behind financials, making it the second-largest source of dividends in the index\u2014with a strong chance of taking the top spot in the near future.\nWhat\u2019s more surprising is that tech companies haven\u2019t just begun distributing dividends\u2014they\u2019ve also seen a select group consistently raise their payouts year after year. This group includes some of the world\u2019s most prominent and successful names, alongside major global consulting firms, credit card providers, and other tech-adjacent players. Over the past several years, dividend growth from the technology sector has outpaced that of the broader market. Data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed that tech companies within the S&P Composite more than doubled their total dividend payouts by 2023 compared to 2013. This growth ranks as the fourth highest among all sectors and significantly surpasses the Index\u2019s overall dividend increase of 7.2% during the same timeframe. With tech\u2019s current dividend payout ratio at just 39%, there appears to be considerable room for further expansion.\nThe move by leading tech firms to start paying dividends has sparked discussions around finding the right balance between capital appreciation and income generation. Sam Witherow, who manages the JPM Global Equity Income fund, noted that although his fund has traditionally included a mix of dividend-paying companies and those focused on capital growth, the characteristics of some of these companies are now evolving. He made the following comment about these strategies:\n\u201cWe are seeking to provide clients with both a yield premium to the market and a dividend growth premium to the market at the aggregate portfolio level. It\u2019s the combination of the two characteristics that typically leads to the best risk-adjusted returns. To deliver this we have always looked to have diversified exposure across global industries including traditionally growthier industries like consumer discretionary or tech.\u201d\nSam Buckingham, an investment manager at Abrdn Portfolio Solutions, pointed out that growth stocks offering smaller dividends could be useful for income funds aiming to diversify across different sectors and investment factors. He explained that while these stocks typically start with lower yields, they often have the potential for dividend growth over time. When paired with more traditional income stocks\u2014like those in the utilities sector that offer higher initial payouts but slower growth\u2014they can help create a more balanced portfolio. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector.\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nFor this list, we scanned the holdings of the S&P Information Technology index, which tracks the performance of major tech companies. From there, we identified companies that pay dividends to shareholders and picked 13 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, as per Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database. The stocks are ranked according to the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 317\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an American multinational tech giant that offers a wide range of related services to its consumers. The company recently unveiled plans to invest ZAR 5.4 billion to expand its cloud and AI infrastructure in South Africa, signaling its continued commitment to driving digital transformation across emerging markets. This move follows a previous ZAR 20.4 billion investment aimed at enhancing local data center capabilities to support businesses, startups, and government organizations.\nFor the second quarter of 2025, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported revenue of $69.6 billion, reflecting a 12% year-over-year increase, while net income climbed 10% to $24.1 billion. The company\u2019s performance was largely supported by a 21% rise in cloud revenue, though growth in Azure remained somewhat tempered. Notably, revenue from AI services soared by 157%, surpassing expectations. Financially, Microsoft remained in a strong position, generating $22.2 billion in operating cash flow and holding $17.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents by quarter\u2019s end. In addition, the company returned $9.5 billion to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.83 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.87%, as of April 10. The company holds a 19-year track record of consistent dividend growth.\nOverall, MSFTranks 1ston our list of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Revenues are projected to reach $111.01 billion, increasing 11.2% from the same quarter last year.\nThe current level reflects an upward revision of 0.1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days.

These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific UnitedHealth metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\nAnalysts expect 'Revenues- Products' to come in at $13.33 billion.

The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 84.3%.\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'UnitedHealthcare Customer Profile - People Served - Commercial - Domestic- Risk-based' will likely reach 9 million. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 8.55 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\nThe consensus estimate for 'UnitedHealthcare Customer Profile - People Served - Commercial - Domestic- Fee-based' stands at 21.46 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 20.87 million.\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'UnitedHealthcare Customer Profile - People Served - Total Community and Senior' should arrive at 20.16 million. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 19.77 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'UnitedHealthcare Customer Profile - People Served - Community and Senior - Medicare Advantage' will reach 8.21 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 7.76 million.\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'UnitedHealthcare Customer Profile - People Served - Community and Senior - Medicaid' of 7.62 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 7.68 million.\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'UnitedHealthcare Customer Profile - People Served - Community and Senior - Medicare Supplement (Standardized)' will reach 4.33 million.

See our live updates.\nMicrosoft(MSFT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this software maker have returned 0% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.6% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Microsoft belongs, has lost 0.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $3.20 per share, indicating a change of +8.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.9% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $13.04 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.5%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.64 indicates a change of +12.3% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Microsoft is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate of $68.36 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.5%. The $275.39 billion and $311.32 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12.4% and +13.1%, respectively.\nMicrosoft reported revenues of $69.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.3%. EPS of $3.23 for the same period compares with $2.93 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $68.7 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.35%. The EPS surprise was +3.86%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMicrosoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coca-Cola belongs, has gained 1.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCoca-Cola is expected to post earnings of $0.72 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.96 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.19 indicates a change of +8.1% from what Coca-Cola is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Coca-Cola.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Coca-Cola, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $47.99 billion and $50.46 billion estimates indicate +2% and +5.1% changes, respectively.\nCoca-Cola reported revenues of $11.54 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.4%. EPS of $0.55 for the same period compares with $0.49 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.69 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.01%. The EPS surprise was +7.84%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nChevron Corporation\u2019s\u00a0CVX operations in Venezuela have hit a major roadblock as state-owned oil firm PDVSA abruptly canceled export authorizations for several of its vessels due to payment uncertainty amid the hardening of U.S. sanctions on the OPEC-member country. This move has left at least two tankers loaded with Venezuelan crude stranded at the port. In contrast, four others were forced to depart empty, indicating a significant intensification in the U.S.-Venezuela energy standoff.\nThe turmoil follows the Trump administration\u2019s recent decision to revoke Chevron\u2019s license to operate in Venezuela. Although the license was set to expire with a wind-down period ending May 27, PDVSA has begun enforcing restrictions ahead of schedule. These actions have derailed the company\u2019s plans to export oil, even for cargoes that were already loaded and awaiting departure.\nTwo Chevron-chartered tankers, named Dubai Attraction and Carina Voyage, remained idle in Venezuelan waters, pending authorization to return their cargoes. These shipments had been formally declared to Venezuela\u2019s customs authority, and now require new clearance to be unloaded or rerouted. Meanwhile, four other Chevron vessels \u2014 Pegasus Star, Ionic Anax, Calypso and Sea Jaguar \u2014 were denied loading access altogether.\nCarina Voyager was en route to Chevron's Pascagoula refinery in Mississippi, while Dubai Attraction was slated to transfer its cargo to the Valero Energy-chartered tanker, Cap Corpus Christi, near Aruba. However, the Cap Corpus Christi departed for the United States on Friday only partially loaded, as it was unable to complete the ship-to-ship transfer.\nThe Venezuelan vice president placed the blame entirely on U.S. sanctions. In a Telegram post, the nation cited that Chevron, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), was not able to pay PDVSA due to the U.S.-driven economic war, thus prompting the return of crude shipments. The shipments are now being rerouted to other international markets, suggesting Venezuela\u2019s intention to gain some alternative buyers.\nYou can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nChevron\u2019s joint ventures in Venezuela produce roughly 25% of the country\u2019s total oil output, which reached an average of 250,000 barrels per day to the United States in early 2025. The sudden halt in its exports not only jeopardizes this flow but also threatens to deepen Venezuela\u2019s economic and political isolation.\nU.S. sanctions had earlier stifled Venezuela\u2019s crude trade with China due to the imposition of a 25% secondary tariff\u00a0on any country that traded with the United States. However, Reuters reports indicate that shipments to China have resumed, although slowly and cautiously.\nThe recent moves also affect other major energy companies. Licenses previously granted toShell plcSHEL andBP p.l.c.BP have also been revoked, disrupting planned offshore gas projects and\u00a0a license\u00a0for French oil firm Maurel & Prom to operate in Venezuela. European firms such asEni S.p.A.E andRepsol, S.A.REPYY are no longer allowed to receive oil from Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA in lieu of payments. The Trump administration\u2019s broader objective appears to be pressuring president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by tightening control over Venezuela\u2019s largest revenue source \u2014 its vast crude reserves.\nSHEL, a London-based oil supermajor and BP, an integrated energy company, had plans to send gas to Trinidad and Tobago through a natural gas project that operated offshore Venezuela. However, the U.S. sanctions gave a major blow to the plans of SHEL and BP.\nBoth BP and SHEL have been hit hard by the withdrawal of the licenses for two gas fields in Venezuelan waters that they plan to develop with Trinidad and Tobago and its National Gas Company.\nIn March 2024, REPYY and E\u00a0also received a notification from the U.S. authorities regarding their revocation of oil licenses for operations in Venezuela.\nRepsol SA explores, develops and produces crude oil products and natural gas, and transports petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gas.\nItaly-based Eni SpA is among the leading integrated energy players in the world. The upstream operations include the exploitation and production of oil and natural gas resources.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings is currently pegged at $7.27 per shareon revenues of $111.01 billion.\nSee the ZacksEarnings Calendarto stay ahead of market-making news.\nFirst-quarter earnings estimates have remained stable over the past week. The bottom-line projection indicates an increase of 5.2% from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests year-over-year growth of 11.2%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor the current year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth\u2019s revenues is pegged at $451.24 billion, implying a rise of 12.7% year over year. Also, the consensus mark for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $29.73, implying a jump of around 7.5% on a year-over-year basis.\nUnitedHealthhas a robust history of surpassing earnings estimates, beating the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters, with the average surprise being 2.5%. This is depicted in the figure below.\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Quote\nHowever, our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for the company this time around. The combination of a positive\u00a0Earnings ESP\u00a0and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, but that\u2019s not the case here.\nUNH has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our\u00a0Earnings ESP Filter.\nYou can seethe complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nUnitedHealth's first-quarter earnings are expected to have benefited fromhigher premiums, driven by the expansion of its domestic commercial membership base. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premium revenues for the first quarter indicates 11.5% year-over-year growth, whereas our model estimate suggests a nearly 9% increase. Higher contributions from both Optum Health and UnitedHealthcare divisions are expected to have supported premium growth.\nUNH's first-quarter top-line performance is expected to have been enhanced by a rise inservice revenuesfrom the Optum brand. Both the consensus estimate and our model estimate imply a nearly 10% jump in service revenues. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate forproduct revenuesindicates an almost 12% increase.\nValue-based care expansion in Optum Health, new client wins at Optum Rx,and enhanced technology-enabled offerings are major tailwinds for the company\u2019s results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from the Optum business segment suggests a 28.6% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from UnitedHealthcare indicates 7.6% year-over-year growth. These are expected to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth in the first quarter.\nNow, let\u2019s focus onmembershipsin selected programs. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealthcare\u2019s total domestic commercial customers suggests 3.5% year-over-year growth, whereas our estimate implies a nearly 2% gain. The consensus mark for Medicare Advantage members indicates a 5.8% year-over-year rise.\nHowever, the consensus estimate for Medicaid memberships implies a 0.8% decline from the year-ago level. Also, international memberships are expected to have declined in the quarter under review due to divestments. These are likely to have pulled total memberships down from the year-ago period. The consensus estimate implies a 0.6% fall year over year.\nRising medical costs, as seniors continue resuming elective procedures,are expected to have elevated UnitedHealth\u2019s overall expenses in the quarter. The expected growth in healthcare utilization, especially in the Medicare Advantage space, might have affected margins, making an earnings beat uncertain this time around. Our model estimate for total operating costs indicates an 8.6% increase from the prior-year period.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNH\u2019s medical care ratio is pegged at 85.92%, up from 84.3% in the year-ago quarter. Our estimates for medical costs and costs of products soldindicate 10% and 9.1% year-over-year increases, respectively.\nUnitedHealth's stock has jumped 18.5% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 18%. Its peers, such asHumana Inc.HUM andMolina Healthcare, Inc.MOH, have gained 16.3% and 18.6%, respectively, during this time. All these stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, which has plunged 9.1% during the same period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNow, let\u2019s look at the value UnitedHealth offers investors at current levels.\nThe company\u2019s valuation looks a bit stretched compared with the industry average. Currently, UNH is trading at 19.47X forward 12 months earnings, slightly above its five-year median of 19.20X and above the industry\u2019s average of 16.71X. In comparison, Humana and Molina Healthcare are currently trading at 19.17X and 13.60X, respectively.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nUnitedHealth\u2019s strategic investments in technology and value-based care \u2014 particularly through its Optum segment \u2014 continue to position the company as a frontrunner in healthcare innovation. This emphasis not only drives operational efficiency but also improves patient outcomes, a key advantage as the industry increasingly shifts toward quality-based models.\nWith projected annual earnings growth of 12.4% over the next five years, UnitedHealth remains a compelling long-term investment. The company\u2019s strong cash flow underpins consistent shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases, reinforcing its financial stability and disciplined capital allocation.\nAdding to the bullish case, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently approved a 5.06% increase in Medicare Advantage (MA) payments for fiscal 2026, a sharp revision from the initially proposed 2.23%.

Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2445093/energy-stocks-take-a-dive-values-or-traps\nWelcome to Episode #401 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n(0:15) - Can You Find Value In The Energy Industry or Are They Traps?\n(6:30) - Tracey Takes A Deep Dive Into 3 Stocks To Consider For Your Portfolio\n(32:20) - Episode Roundup: XOM, CVX, EOG\nPodcast@Zacks.com\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\nIn April 2025, after the Liberation Day tariffs were put into place by the United States, crude oil plunged. WTI traded down to $56 a barrel and has been gyrating between $55 and $65 ever since.\nWhile lower oil prices can mean good news for consumers at the pump, it\u2019s bad news for the energy producers who are unhedged and have certain breakeven levels.\nThe oil and natural gas stocks have gotten hammered due to falling commodity prices and the uncertainty from the tariff turbulence of 2025. Although oil escaped direct American tariffs.\nEnergy companies are lumped into different categories within the oil industry. In this podcast, Tracey talks about \u201cBig Oil\u201d which are the large, integrated oil companies and the American explorers and producers, or the \u201cE & Ps.\u201d\nThe Integrated Oil stocks, as an industry, are down just 3.9% year-to-date. But the American E&Ps, as an industry, are now down 27.8% on the year.\nThe E&Ps, which do not have refining, chemicals, or other divisions to offset their production, are much more volatile when oil sells off.\nJust because a stock sells-off and now has a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a true value in the classical sense of the word.\nRemember, a true value stock is cheap on a P/E basis, but also has rising earning estimates.\nAre the energy stocks cheap, or just traps?\nExxon Mobil is a large American integrated oil company. Shares of Exxon are down 7.1% year-to-date but have finally started sinking in the last month, falling 10.6% in that time.\nExxon appears cheap with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.1. The 2025 Zacks Consensus Estimate is looking for $7.13 but that\u2019s 8.5% under the $7.79 Exxon made last year. One earnings estimate has been revised higher for 2025 and 2 lower in the last week.\nExxon is a dividend all-star, with its dividend currently yielding 3.9%.\nIs Exxon Mobil a value or a trap in 2025?\nChevron is also a large, American integrated oil company. Shares of Chevron are down 6.8% year-to-date but have been hit harder over the last month than Exxon. It\u2019s down 14.3% during that time. But there have been dramatic one-day swings the last week.\nChevron is cheap. It has a forward P/E of 13.3. The Zacks Consensus is looking for $10.30 in 2025, which is earnings growth of 2.5% as it made $10.05 in 2024.\nChevron also pays an attractive dividend, yielding 4.8%.\nIs Chevron a value after the sell-off or a trap?\nEOG Resources is a large cap American exploration and production company. It produces in key basins including the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, and Dorado Play.

Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2445093/energy-stocks-take-a-dive-values-or-traps\nWelcome to Episode #401 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n(0:15) - Can You Find Value In The Energy Industry or Are They Traps?\n(6:30) - Tracey Takes A Deep Dive Into 3 Stocks To Consider For Your Portfolio\n(32:20) - Episode Roundup: XOM, CVX, EOG\nPodcast@Zacks.com\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\nIn April 2025, after the Liberation Day tariffs were put into place by the United States, crude oil plunged. WTI traded down to $56 a barrel and has been gyrating between $55 and $65 ever since.\nWhile lower oil prices can mean good news for consumers at the pump, it\u2019s bad news for the energy producers who are unhedged and have certain breakeven levels.\nThe oil and natural gas stocks have gotten hammered due to falling commodity prices and the uncertainty from the tariff turbulence of 2025. Although oil escaped direct American tariffs.\nEnergy companies are lumped into different categories within the oil industry. In this podcast, Tracey talks about \u201cBig Oil\u201d which are the large, integrated oil companies and the American explorers and producers, or the \u201cE & Ps.\u201d\nThe Integrated Oil stocks, as an industry, are down just 3.9% year-to-date. But the American E&Ps, as an industry, are now down 27.8% on the year.\nThe E&Ps, which do not have refining, chemicals, or other divisions to offset their production, are much more volatile when oil sells off.\nJust because a stock sells-off and now has a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a true value in the classical sense of the word.\nRemember, a true value stock is cheap on a P/E basis, but also has rising earning estimates.\nAre the energy stocks cheap, or just traps?\nExxon Mobil is a large American integrated oil company. Shares of Exxon are down 7.1% year-to-date but have finally started sinking in the last month, falling 10.6% in that time.\nExxon appears cheap with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.1. The 2025 Zacks Consensus Estimate is looking for $7.13 but that\u2019s 8.5% under the $7.79 Exxon made last year. One earnings estimate has been revised higher for 2025 and 2 lower in the last week.\nExxon is a dividend all-star, with its dividend currently yielding 3.9%.\nIs Exxon Mobil a value or a trap in 2025?\nChevron is also a large, American integrated oil company. Shares of Chevron are down 6.8% year-to-date but have been hit harder over the last month than Exxon. It\u2019s down 14.3% during that time. But there have been dramatic one-day swings the last week.\nChevron is cheap. It has a forward P/E of 13.3. The Zacks Consensus is looking for $10.30 in 2025, which is earnings growth of 2.5% as it made $10.05 in 2024.\nChevron also pays an attractive dividend, yielding 4.8%.\nIs Chevron a value after the sell-off or a trap?\nEOG Resources is a large cap American exploration and production company. It produces in key basins including the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, and Dorado Play. EOG Resources has a strategy of returning at a minimum of 70% of annual free cash flow to shareholders.\nShares of EOG Resources have fallen 14.7% year-to-date but have really taken it on the chin in the last month, declining 16.9%. It\u2019s cheap, with a forward P/E of 9.5. A P/E under 10 is usually considered a dirt-cheap stock.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is looking for $11.09. EOG Resources made $11.62 last year so that is a decline of 4.6%.\nEOG Resources is currently paying a dividend yielding 3.5%.\nIs EOG Resources a value or a trap in 2025?\nTune into this week\u2019s podcast to find out.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nTariffs are rattling markets and leading to spikes in volatility. Growth-focused sectors like technology andconsumer discretionaryare particularly vulnerable given their cyclicality and global exposure.\nApple(AAPL0.05%)andNike(NKE-1.46%)are down over 20% year to date at the time of this writing, significantly underperforming theS&P 500andNasdaq Composite, which are also down significantly. Here's why both stocks are selling off and whether they are worth buying now.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThere's no sugarcoating Apple's exposure to tariffs, especially in China. China is a key market for Apple -- both from a manufacturing and a sales perspective.\nAfter Apple stock surged on April 9 in response to a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs to all countries except China, it sank 4% the following day on news that the tariff rate on Chinese goods would be raised to astaggering 145%. If it sticks, that steep of a tariff rate would crush Apple's near-term profitability. That's why the stock is down so much year to date.\n^SPXdata byYCharts\nBuying Apple stock now is a belief that two things will happen:\nOn April 10, reports indicated that Apple was flying iPhones from India to the U.S. to circumnavigate tariffs on China. If Apple feels China could be a longer-term risk, it could work to permanently shift manufacturing out of China toward India and other partners in Southeast Asia. However, investors may want to wait for Apple's upcoming earnings call on May 1 to better understand how the company plans to reduce the tariff impact.\nAs for Apple's pricing power, iPhone growth has slowed in recent years. But the company has made up for some of that slowdown by growing its high-margin services segment and repurchasing stock to grow earnings per share. Entertainment services include Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, Apple Books, and more. Apple also has a growing list of financial services, from Apple Pay to Apple Card and Apple Cash.\nApple has yet to make as big a splash in artificial intelligence as some investors may have hoped for, so there are fears that it lacks the pricing power it once had. However, services have enhanced the breadth of the Apple ecosystem.\nAll told, Apple stands out as a solid buy if you believe in its ability to navigate supply chain challenges and its pricing power. But it's also reasonable to take a wait-and-see approach until investors get more clarity on Apple's response to tariffs from the earnings call in a few weeks.\nNike's year-to-date losses are even more alarming, considering it was already one of the worst-performing components of theDow Jones Industrial Averagelast year. Nike has sold off so much that it is now hovering around its lowest level in a decade.\nThe abridged version of Nike's problems is that it overly invested in switching the business away from wholesale partnerships to digital, which worked during the pandemic but proved a costly error in recent years, as thedirect-to-consumer segment has been underperforming wholesaleand Nike's brick-and-mortar stores. In addition to management blunders, Nike has been hit hard by formidable competition fromAdidasand newer players likeOn HoldingandDeckers Outdoor-owned Hoka.\nTariffs throw yet another wrench in the Nike investment thesis at a time when the company was already licking its wounds from past mistakes. Reports indicate that Nike makes95% of its shoes in China, Vietnam, and Indonesia.China is a key market for Nike's sales as well.\nFor the nine months ended Feb. 28, Greater China sales were $5.11 billion compared to $14.87 billion in North America and $9.26 billion in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. During that period, Nike sold more footwear, apparel, and equipment in Greater China than the rest of Asia Pacific and Latin America combined -- with Greater China making up a significant 15.1% of total Nike Brand revenue during that nine-month period.\nLike Apple, buying Nike stock now is a bet on the power of its brand, that it can turn the business around, handle competition, and pivot its supply chain. However, Nike is arguably more vulnerable than Apple, considering the business was already in the middle of aturnaroundbefore the onset of trade tensions.\nNike has gone from a growth stock to a dividend-paying value stock. Despite its struggles, the company has continued to buy back stock and has23 consecutive years of dividend raises. The sell-off in the stock price has pushed Nike's yield up to a 10-year high of 2.8% and itsprice-to-earnings ratiodown to a 10-year low of just 18. Although if tariffs stick around, Nike's earnings will almost certainly fall in the near term -- making its valuation less appealing.\nApple and Nike may operate in entirely different industries, but the buy case for both companies is similar. Both face serious tariff risks, and neither company has been growing earnings at breakneck rates in recent years. However, these are two top brands whose valuations could look cheap in hindsight if they can endure this challenging period.\nApple stands out as the safer all-around play, whereas Nike has a higher risk and potential reward if it can turn the business around and navigate tariffs. Both stocks could be worth buying now if you have a long-term horizon. However, it's also reasonable to keep both stocks on a watch list and wait for upcoming earnings calls for more clarity on their strategies, given we are sailing through uncharted waters.\nBefore you buy stock inApple, consider this:\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 andApplewasn\u2019t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other best medical stocks to buy according to billionaires.\nSome experts view medical, healthcare, and big pharma stocks as immune from trade carnage, making them a safe haven amid the uncertainty brought about by Trump\u2019s tariffs. On April 8, Mizuho Securities America healthcare sector strategist Jared Holz appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Power Lunch\u2019 to talk about whether the speculations around the healthcare sector being a safe haven during market turmoil are true. He also discussed why healthcare companies are failing to get increased investor respect, given that healthcare is 20% of the American economy, which translates to around 1/5th of the country\u2019s entire national output.\nHolz said that the country\u2019s major healthcare and pharmaceutical companies undoubtedly help fight its healthcare problems. However, when we look at their financial models and the way their businesses are currently set up, we have got generic patent cliffs over the next 5-7 years on the medium to long-term angle of the company, along with price concessions with the IRA and some of the things the Biden administration put into place. We have also got pricing degradation over the near term, and between those two lies competition and other setbacks. The models thus never line up well enough for investors to have a lot of confidence, as the business models do not lend themselves to long-term viability. These are the primary reasons the sector and stocks have been under pressure for so long.\nREAD ALSO:10 Best Mid Cap Biotech Stocks to Buyand12 Best Diagnostics Stocks to Invest In Right Now.\nHolz further opined that managed care, particularly the government-centric names, are somewhat safe as they are insulated from tariffs as US-based companies. In fact, the economic slowdown is actually beneficial for them as they want less utilization and less patience through the system, which is how they typically beat numbers. He said that managed care is having a good day, and investors might think about owning some companies in the sector.\nIt is, however, a relative game, as there are several different variables at play, and investors are essentially playing a game of hopscotch in an attempt to jump from one area to another, whether it\u2019s tariffs, drug pricing, or other public policies. He painted a similar picture for medical device stocks that are more US-centric. These two sectors thus have less risk relative to others, making them somewhat of a safe haven.\nIn this article, we first sifted through ETFs and financial media reports to compile a preliminary list of stocks. We then examined Insider Monkey\u2019s exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to select the 10 best medical stocks with the most billionaire investors. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world\u2019s leading hedge funds and companies.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

The company\u00a0takes the second spot on our list of the best medical stocks to invest in now.\nVulcan Value Partners stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q4 2024 investorletter:\n\u201cUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), a company that we have owned several times in the past, is the largest health insurer in the United States. UnitedHealth Group also owns Optum, which is a rapidly growing healthcare services company. The environment for the health insurance business remains positive as growth in healthcare spending, driven by chronic diseases and an aging population, will continue to outpace overall economic growth. The insurance business benefits from powerful network effects as more members attract more providers and vice versa, which reinforces United\u2019s value proposition and bargaining power with each side of the network. We respect UnitedHealth Group\u2019s management team and have been very pleased with their long-term vision and execution.\u201d\nOverall, UNHranks 2ndon our list of best medical stocks to buy according to billionaires.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.\nThe market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump\u2019s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year.\nThe year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios.\nIn the second month of 2025, the US government\u2019s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States\u2019 tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services.\nDW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods & services in the latest round of \u201cTrump Tariffs\u201d. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering \u201ccontinuous stagflation\u201d, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment.\nThis scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children\u2019s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children\u2019s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President & CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing:\n\u201cMake sure that money can be talked about, that there\u2019s no taboos\u2026so that your children are learning those really good financial literacy skills that they need to set themselves up for success for the rest of their life.\u201d\nInvesting in the markets for your children\u2019s future has the advantage of time. In a report by MorningStar, investments in stocks have the added benefit of compounding return, which means the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to grow exponentially. CNBC reported on billionaire investor Mark Cuban and how he made billions from his first few million with a long-term view on his investments.\nTo compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources and gathered the stocks they collectively favored. These stocks have a long-standing history of performance, with strong balance sheets and sound financials. Then, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s proprietary database of billionaire stock holdings to arrive at our list of 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires as of Q4 2024.

It is a household name, especially in the United States, with brands such as McChicken, BigMac, and many more under its umbrella.\nMcDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) experienced a turbulent year-end. The United States food industry was in peril following news of an E. coli outbreak. As a result, negative goodwill towards the aforementioned brands was inevitable. The Q4 2024 earnings report revealed a drop in sales by 28% YoY to $6.93 billion and an EPS of $2.83. Chairman and CEO of MCD, Chris Kempczinski, spoke on the company\u2019s performance during the earnings call, stating:\n\u201cFirst, we have the right strategy, accelerating the Arches. Our MCD growth pillars still offer significant growth opportunities and I\u2019m pleased with the 2025 market plans, particularly their balance of value and full margin food innovation.\nMcDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)\u2019s cash position makes it one of the best kid-friendly stocks on our list.

It\u2019s a recipe for losing money.\u201d\nREAD ALSO10 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar RecentlyandJim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks\nCramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump\u2019s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. \u201cAs a nation, shamefully, we\u2019ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,\u201d he said\n\u201cI think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.\u201d\nCramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. \u201cYes, we have to take them on now or never,\u201d he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept.\n\u201cSo the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it\u2019s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it\u2019s not worth it to go back\u2026 [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I\u2019m actually thinking that might be where we\u2019\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) produces nonalcoholic drinks that include soft drinks, water, tea, juice, and plant-based options. It also supplies beverage concentrates and syrups for sale through retail channels. During the episode, Cramer stated, \u201cUtility, Verizon, perfect Coca-Cola, Waste Management. Yeah, these are timeless.\u201d\nOn March 31, during an episode of Squawk on the Street, Cramer mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and said:\n\u201cIn terms of shorting, like if you wanna short, do you short Coca-Cola? No, cause Coca-Cola in 2000, after the NASDAQ broke, was really a terrific stock to own\u2026 Look at that April 14th to April 17th 2000 period when we had this dramatic switch. Which was rather incredible, which was the fastest I\u2019ve seen where Coca-Cola went from being a loser to a winner. I think we\u2019re there. Coca-Cola\u2019s having a good quarter.\u201d\nOverall, KOranks 7thon our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of KO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against other best golf stocks to buy according to analysts.\nGolf stocks are publicly traded firms that are part of the golf industry. These companies include businesses that manufacture golf equipment, operate golf courses, and provide associated services, giving investors a chance to engage in the golf market.\nThe golf industry continues to evolve with women, social play, lessons, and online bookings driving key developments. According to a report by NBC Sports Next, female engagement has grown by 15%, with 800,000 more women golfers joining between 2020 and 2022, compared to a 2% rise among male golfers. Women now account for one-third of junior players and 49% of surveyed golfers. Golf remains a strongly social activity, with 49% of surveyed golfers primarily playing with friends. Business-related golf is also growing, notably among GolfNow users. While 36% of golfers took a lesson in the previous year, the number rose to 67% among GolfNow customers, with many preferring a combination of on-course and facility-based training. Moreover, younger golfers are frequently booking online, with 43% of those aged 18 to 34 reserving at least one round by 2023. Speed and convenience are essential, with 55% citing online booking as the quickest option. These developments point out expansion prospects for courses that cater to women, social golfers, and digitally aware players.\nAccording to the National Golf Foundation\u2019s research, the golf business in the United States is still expanding rapidly, with 45 million Americans (aged 6 and up) playing golf in 2023, including 26.6 million on-course and 18.4 million in off-course venues like simulators and Topgolf. The business has seen nearly 2 million new golfers each year for the past ten years, with 3.4 million first-time players projected in 2023 alone. The largest consumer age group is still young adults (18-34 years old), with 6.3 million participants on the course and 5.8 million off. Since 2019, juniors (3.5 million) have shot up by 40%, with girls accounting for 37%. Female involvement has climbed to 7 million, making up 26% of on-course golfers. In 2023, rounds played reached a record high of 531 million, beating the pre-pandemic average by more than 10%. The US offers 16,000 courses at 14,000 facilities, with 75% open to the public. Despite a 12% drop in course supply since 2006, demand remains high, with 22.4 million people expressing a desire to play.\nFinally, TGL, the golf league that began playing matches in January 2025, is combining digital and physical components to create an entirely new hybrid golf experience. Teams of golfers compete in a specially created venue across a set of custom-made holes. They begin by hitting a large-screen simulator of real terrain, then shift to a transformable turntable as the green. Broadcasting innovations aimed at bringing golfers\u2019 experiences closer to home viewers were deemed crucial from the start. The 2025 PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando showcased the golf industry\u2019s strong momentum.\nMarc Simon, Vice President of PGA Golf Exhibitions, stated:\n\u201cThe show is a reflection of the industry, and golf is thriving right now,\u201d \u201cWith the surging popularity of golf, we saw the largest number of exhibitors and largest occupied space since 2009, which is encouraging to see.\u201d\nThe exhibition included over 1,000 exhibitors spread across 1.1 million square feet, showcasing golf\u2019s continuous development in the $102 billion industry. More than 1,200 VIP buyers from 770 golf courses and mass merchandisers attended, totaling $810 million in purchasing power and roughly $2 billion in retail sales potential. The event has progressed beyond typical golf equipment and gear to include fitness, health, and wellness areas, as well as racquet sports and club facilities. The Clubhouse exhibition space was doubled in size, mirroring the trend in golf facilities toward broader member experiences.\nTechnology was a major focus, with AI-powered golf simulators, effective ball-flight data, and next-generation golf carts catering to growing personal cart ownership. Golf\u2019s trends are shifting, with a record 200 influencers in attendance and robust clothing growth fueled by Gen Z consumers. The PGA Show\u2019s reinvention is in line with industry trends, stressing experiential marketing and innovation. Looking ahead, organizers intend to continue responding to changing company needs in order to ensure long-term industry success.\nA team of trainers and athletes displaying a wide range of athletic and casual footwear.\nFor this list, we compiled an initial list of 12 golf stocks, which included companies that are involved in the golf industry.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nInvestors are looking for solid dividend stocks with volatility returning to the markets. There are several top stocks offering yields much better than theS&P 500average of 1.44%, but some of these businesses are struggling competitively and are only offering high yields because their share prices have collapsed.\nIt's ideal to find high-yield stocks of strong companies that are delivering solid financial results and showing share price appreciation potential. Here are two dividend payers that are doing just that.\nCoca-Cola(KO-0.68%)has historically weatheredrecessionswell. It has increased the dividend for 63 consecutive years after recently increasing its quarterly payment by 5% to $0.51. It's a great option for someone looking to boost their portfolio's average yield with relatively low risk.\nCoca-Cola generates a significant portion of its annual revenue from making concentrate syrup for its trademark brand. This is a capital-light business model that churns out robust profits. The company's profit margin has remained above 20% over the last five years.\nDespite choppy consumer spending behavior, global unit case volume grew 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 1% for 2024. The company continues to adjust its marketing strategy and capitalize on its knowledge of local markets globally to drive sales. The company has been particularly effective at linking its beverages to different occasions, such as music or food, that resonate with consumers.\nThe stock has climbed 20% over the last year, and it currently offers aforward dividend yieldof 2.88%. Analysts expectCoca-Colato grow earnings at an annualized rate of 6% over the next several years. Combined with the high yield, investors can expect to earn an average annual return around 9%, which is slightly less than the historical return of the S&P 500 but with the advantage of earning a much higher dividend yield.\nLeading wireless service providers are very resilient in recessions. Eliminating a phone or internet payment plan is probably the last thing people are going to cut in a recession. Shares ofAT&T(T1.21%)have climbed about 59% over the last year, driven by healthy demand for wireless phone plans and high-speed internet service.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor\u2019stotal average return is800%\u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now\u2026\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nAT&T cut its dividend in 2022 to shore up funds to service its debt. The company's current quarterly dividend is $0.2775, bringing its forward yield to 4.2%. Instead of increasing its dividend, management has left the dividend unchanged as it focuses on paying down debt and investing for growth.\nIt's normal for telecoms to use a lot of debt, since they benefit from regular monthly bills from customers, which provides a high level of certainty for annual revenue and cash flows. The company's debt has declined from $177 billion in 2021 to $123 billion in 2024, while paying out less than half itsfree cash flowin dividends over the past year.\nAT&T entered 2025 with momentum. It reported 1.7 million postpaid phone net additions last year, which refers to the monthly bills people pay for wireless service. The company also added 1 million AT&T Fiber net additions for the seventh consecutive year.It aims to keep pressure on competitors by focusing on delivering quality service and good deals.\nThe company generated more than $17 billion in free cash flow last year on $122 billion of revenue. The 4.2% forward yield, combined with management's optimism that it can growAT&T's business to increase the share price, makes this an excellent income investment for 2025 and beyond.\nBefore you buy stock inCoca-Cola, consider this:\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 andCoca-Colawasn\u2019t one of them.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nThe stock market has sold off sharply this year, with theS&P 500(^GSPC-0.10%)recently down about 10% since 2025 began. While stock market sell-offs can be tough to stomach, there is a silver lining to downturns.\nStock prices and dividend yields have an inverse relationship. So, as a stock's price falls, its dividend yield rises.Because of that, you can cash in on a stock market sell-off by locking in higher yields on some topdividend stocks.\nExxonMobil(XOM-0.03%),PepsiCo(PEP-2.40%), andPrologis(PLD0.51%)currently offer dividend yields of around 4%, which aregreatlevels for these elite dividend stocks.\nShares ofExxonMobilhave tumbled more than 15% from their high point earlier this year. That slump has driven the oil giant's dividend yieldupto around 4%. That's much higher than the dividend yield on the S&P 500 (around 1.4%).\nExxonMobil increased its dividend payment by 4% earlier this year. That extended its annual dividend growth streak to 42 straight years -- a track record achieved by only 4% of companies in the S&P 500.\nThe oil company is in a strong position to continue growing its dividend.It produced $34.4 billion in free cash flowlast year, easily covering its $16.7 billion dividend outlay.Meanwhile, the company has a fortress-like balance sheet with an ultra-lowleverage ratioof 6% and $23.2 billion of cash.\nExxon is working on a strategy to increase its annual cash flows by $30 billion by 2030. It plans to remove billions of dollars in structural costs from its business and invest heavily in growing its highest-margin production. That should give it plenty of fuel to continue raising its dividend in the future.\nPepsiCo stock is down nearly 10% from its peak earlier this year.That has driven up the beverage and snacking giant's dividend yield to 3.8%,based on its current dividend payment.The company has already announced that it will increase its dividend payment by another 5% starting in June. That puts itsforward dividend yieldright around 4%.\nThat dividend increase extends PepsiCo's growth streak to 53 straight years. It will keep the company in the elite group ofDividend Kings: companies with 50 or more years of increasing their dividend payments.\nPepsiCo is in a strong position to continue growing its dividend. The beverage and snacking giant produces lots of cash. It generated $12.5 billion in net cash from operating activities last year -- more than enough to cover its $7.6 billionindividend payments.\nPepsiCo also has a strong cash-rich balance sheet (nearly $9.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments). The company uses its strong excess free cash flow to invest in organicallygrowingits business and make acquisitions (it recently agreed to buy Poppi for $1.7 billion), which should support continued dividend growth.\nPrologis stock has lost nearly a quarter of its value this year. That sell-off has drivenupthe real estate investment trust's (REIT) dividend yield to around 4.3%.\nThe leading industrial REIT has a great record of growing its dividend. It has increased its payout for 12 straight years while growing it at a 13% compound annual rate over the past five years. That's an elite rate, as it's more than double the pace of the S&P 500 (5%) and REIT sector average (also5%).\nPrologis is in an excellent position to continue increasing its dividend.The industrial REIT has one of thestrongest balance sheets in the sector, which allowsit to invest in development projects and make accretive acquisitions.\nMeanwhile, it's benefiting from strong demand for logistics real estate from catalysts like the growing adoption of e-commerce. Prologisis also usingsome of its vast landbankto develop data centers, providing it with an additional growth catalyst.\nThe stock market sell-offis providinginvestors with the opportunity to cash in by buying high-quality dividend stocks and locking in their higher yields. That positions investors to generate more income in the future, boosting their total return potential.\nBefore you buy stock inExxonMobil, consider this:\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 andExxonMobilwasn\u2019t one of them.

It certainly jibes with what I've heard through the years from investor relations leads, CFOs, and CEOs.\nThese keepers of the numbers have told me they are beholden to the market and its whims, and they spend insane amounts of time crafting earnings call narratives and plotting out guidance ranges.\nIt all seems so silly, seeing as it's not required to issue guidance at all!\nAnd this brings me to today's thoughts.\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo'sTermsandPrivacy Policy\nNow could be a good time for execs to use the cover ofTrump tariff uncertaintyto stop providing guidance of any kind, once and for all.\nAfter all, how can one believe any outstanding numbers in this environment (and environments three and a half years from now) when it could literally change with one Truth Social post?\nDelta (DAL) CEO Ed Bastiancaught a clue this week and yanked guidance.\nLevi's (LEVI) CEO Michelle Gass rolled the dice and let the company's outstanding full-year profit guidance ride.\nI found it bizarre, given Levi's stands to get hammered by tariffs due to its origin of sourcing. Shortly before Trump's 90-day tariff pause, one former apparel CEO told me by text the price of a pair of jeans could go up 50% to 100%. But the pause didn't include China, which now has a rate of 145%.\nBut hey, at least Gass has formed aninternal \"task force\"to begin figuring out the tariff impact on the business.\nWalmart (WMT) CEODoug McMillonand CFOJohn David Raineymet investors in the middle. The companywarned on operating profits for the first quarterbut left its full-year range unchanged.\n\"I suspended guidance once in my six years and that was during COVID,\" former Hostess Brands CEOAndy Callahantold me.\nHe added, \"CEOs/CFOs do a lot of work to understand the forecast and do sensitivities to those inputs to determine a RELIABLE RANGE of outcomes. When two things happen at once like is happening now ... ie a large range of uncertainty or short time to solve, they will suspend. The level of impact happening now is uncertain and likely outside range of CEOs to solve. They will likely suspend for at least a quarter. Guidance is not required and an uncertain or inaccurate guide is worse than a very rational suspension. And saying it does not include the impacts and keeping the guide is disingenuous.\"\nCEOs tell me a lot of companies are likely to remove guidance when earnings season begins next week. It feels like the right move, even if it hits the company's stock price. That means investors will have to assess companies differently \u2014 think more textbook-like than trying to predict an earnings number and subsequent stock reaction.\nI am curious, though: How much historically do you rely on sales and profit guidance from a company you own? And if you do rely heavily on that guidance, are you doing so now, given any outstanding forecasts are bordering on useless because of tariff uncertainty? I am eager to hear your thoughts \u2014 drop me a line on X@BrianSozzi.\nFull disclosure: I have for years disliked corporate guidance and have been steadfast in saying the practice should be stopped.\nTime to say bye-bye to analyst forecasts and whipsawing stock prices in the seconds after the earnings result hits the tape!\nI think a company's investment worthiness should be dictated by the pure health of the business, not by how an investment bankthinksa business should be doing based on their various spreadsheet inputs.\nThe pure health of the business could be assessed by scrutinizing sequential sales, margins, profits, and cash flow growth rates on an absolute and relative basis (being simplistic here, but it can be done this way at the bare minimum).\nNevertheless, here is what some top former public company CEOs told me about offering profit guidance during times of considerable economic and policy uncertainty, as is presently the case.\nFormer Cisco CEO John Chambers\n\"General guidelines I follow in times of uncertainty are to err on the side of transparency and openness even if that requires a wider range in the guidance, with appropriate disclaimers, given the market conditions.\"\nBoston Consulting Group chair Rich Lesser\n\"We believe a pause in point estimates of forward guidance is justified for the most impacted industries with the widest outcomes. This should come with:\nColor on moving parts (e.g., tariffs, pricing, elasticity, supply chain moves, productivity & savings to ease pressure, ability to monetize/sell assets) to help investors and analysts model scenarios.\nA commitment to share as much as possible as soon as possible (ideally weeks not months).\nA commitment to get back to formal guidance in the short-to-medium term when the situation has clarified/stabilized a bit.\"\nFormer Medtronic CEO Bill George\n\"We have discussed this question with CEOs recently.\nGiven the uncertainty created by constantly changing tariffs and their unknown impact on the economy and on supply chains, I believe it is wise to withhold guidance on near-term revenues and earnings. This situation is similar to what CEOs experienced with COVID in 2020.\"\nBrian Sozziis Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on X@BrianSozzi,Instagram, andLinkedIn. Tips on stories?

See our live updates.\nUnlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nEconomist and gold advocatePeter Schiffis back with sharp criticism of both Bitcoin and PresidentDonald Trump'slatest economic policies. On Monday, Schiff said the newly formedStrategic Bitcoin Reservehas already lost more than 12% of its value since it was created on March 6. He argued that if the government had opted to invest in gold instead, the reserve would be showing a 2% gain.\nDon't Miss:\n\u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share.\n\"A month ago on Mar. 6th, Trump established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,\" Schiffpostedon X. \"So far, the value of the Bitcoin held in that reserve has declined by over 12%. Had the U.S. sold it and added to our gold reserve, not only would we have avoided that loss, but we would now have a 2% gain.\"\nWhen a user pushed back, asking about the trillions lost when the U.S. sold Bitcoin years ago, Schiff replied, \u201cThat\u2019s irrelevant, as we didn\u2019t have a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve years ago. We can only count how much money the government gains or loses going forward of the reserve.\u201d\nLast month, Schiff warned that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve isbeing used to lure inunsuspecting investors. \u201cThe crypto industry is using the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to scam more Americans into buying crypto. Thanks to Trump, more Americans will lose more money in crypto than in any prior speculative mania in history.\u201d He mentioned the $TRUMP meme coin as a \u201cperfect example,\u201d saying it was already down over 80%.\nTrending: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm \u2014invest pre-IPO from $0.55 per share now.\nSchiff didn't stop with Bitcoin. He also took aim at Trump's new round of tariffs,calling them an even worse idea. \u201cTariffs are worse. Doing nothing would be less harmful than what Trump is doing,\u201d Schiffsaid.\nHe argued that the crypto market has been trending downward when measured in gold andwarnedthat Ethereum could fall below $1,000, a level it last saw in June 2022. At the time of writing, the price is $1,463. Despite pushback from crypto traders highlighting the technology and ecosystem growth, Schiff stuck to his stance: over the past three-and-a-half years, Bitcoin has lost more than 30% of its value in gold terms.\nSchiff also weighed in on how Trump's tariffs could affect major American brands.
