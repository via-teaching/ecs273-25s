The world economy is hanging by a thread, as the macroeconomic environment consists of trade wars, retaliatory tariffs, and political unrest in Ukraine and the Middle East. It adds to economic uncertainty, with market experts offering cautious economic forecasts. According to EY, the euro area will experience a modest economic turnaround in 2025, and growth is expected to increase from 0.7% last year to 1.3% and 1.8% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. It is forecasted to simmer down to 1.4% in 2027. Among all European countries, Malta is projected to experience the highest GDP growth in 2025 at 4%. EY expects soft employment growth across Europe, driven by demographic challenges and subdued labor demand. Unemployment will likely remain at 2024 levels. While nominal wage this year will clock in higher than pre-pandemic levels, wage growth will take a hit. Central and Eastern European countries are forecasted to experience relatively higher inflation in 2025, while the overall rate remains just over 2% in the euro area.
Meanwhile, German economic institutes have slashed their growth projections for 2025 to 0.1% from the previous forecast of 0.8% in September 2024. This revised estimate does not incorporate the recent tariffs levied by the US. These tariffs will be a major setback for European economies, possibly toppling them over the edge of recession for the third consecutive year. The new conservative government declared a €500 billion fund to improve infrastructure and defence and stimulate growth. The fiscal package enhances the economic outlook for 2026 and 2027.
However, as the United States is feeling the pressure from high valuations and growing political instability, analysts are looking towards Europe as a better bet for stock investors. Analysts point towards Europe offering a more stable outlook, with lower stock prices, clearer policy direction, and even potential interest rate cuts on the horizon. Investors seem to be shifting their focus, partly because the threat of US tariffs on Europe, especially on automobiles, feels less uncertain now that details are clearer. There is also less exposure to tech in Europe, which is seen as a good thing right now. Europe’s markets, with just 10% tech exposure in the Europe 600 compared to 30% in the broader market, look more balanced.
With solid earnings, rising share buybacks, and cheaper stock valuations, investors are turning to Europe. Experts suggest that European and UK markets now have their best shot in years at outperforming the US. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the best-performing stocks in Europe so far in 2025.
