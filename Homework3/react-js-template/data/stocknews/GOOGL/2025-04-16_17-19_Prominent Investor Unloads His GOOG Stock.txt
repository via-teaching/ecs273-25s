Well-known investor Josh Brown disclosed on CNBC recently that he had sold all of his shares of Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL).
Brown, the CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, stated that he was concerned about the impact of ChatGPT on Alphabet's core internet search business.
A laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.
Details About Brown's Decision and His Motivation
After selling half of his GOOG stock earlier this year, Brown recently parted with his remaining shares.
"Google's (search engine) has never had to compete the way that it does now with younger generations jumping right into ChatGPT when they want to know something," Brown asserted. These young consumers "are not looking for blue links and ads; they just want an answer," he explained.
Google will have to find a way to deal with this challenge, the investor believes.
Brown Suggests That GOOG Is Not Defensive
"I think this will be a defensive year," said Brown, who asserted that Alphabet and Meta (META) are "the most reliant on ad revenue" among large-cap tech names. But according to the investor, the moat around Meta's Instagram is "arguably stronger" than that of Google around search.

The class action, filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal on Tuesday, argues that Google's actions enabled it to charge higher prices for the advertisements that appear in search inquiries than it otherwise could in a competitive market.  It said the U.S. tech giant contracted phone makers to pre-install Google Search and the Chrome browser on Android devices and paid Apple to make it the default search engine on iPhones, with the intention of shutting out competition.
