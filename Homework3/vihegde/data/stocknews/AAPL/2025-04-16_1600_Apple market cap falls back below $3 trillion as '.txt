Apple (AAPL) stock fell nearly 4% on Wednesday, sending the iPhone maker's market capitalization back below $3 trillion as tariff pressures continue to weigh on the company after shares had enjoyed what some analysts called a "relief rally" earlier in the week.
Apple stock surged to start the week, leading the "Magnificent Seven" stocks higher as investors cheered the Trump administration's temporary tariff exemptions for tech products announced over the weekend.
The "relief rally," as Citi's Atif Malik put it, briefly put Apple's value back above the $3 trillion mark after falling to its lowest value in almost a year last week at just under $2.6 trillion.
Apple is still the world's most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft (MSFT).
US Customs and Border Protection issued regulations late Friday exempting consumer electronics — and almost all of Apple's products — from reciprocal tariffs.
On April 2, Trump announced global reciprocal tariffs that would go into effect on April 9.

The president instead announced a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariff plan last Wednesday — with the exception of a 145% reciprocal tariff on Chinese imports, a development cheered by Apple investors. Some 90% of Apple's iPhones are made in China.
Apple had shed more than $770 billion from its market cap between April 2 and April 8.
Apple's decline on Wednesday comes after Nvidia (NVDA) disclosed late Tuesday that the Trump administration had effectively banned exports of its H20 chips to China.
Nvidia's disclosure followed reports that Trump had been set to back off plans to restrict Nvidia's chips designed for China to comply with US trade rules.
To Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, these developments show that there are “many conflicting opinions within Trump's team on the issue of tariffs, strategies against China and US tech restrictions."
"The concern about Apple is that it will become harder to avoid the crossfire between the US and China as tariffs and restrictions come into play," DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an email.
"The [export] restrictions on chips that came out from NVIDIA represent an escalation in the trade dispute."
Tech stocks fell across the board Wednesday, with the Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropping 3%.
Fellow Magnificent Seven stocks Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) also sank, falling nearly 4%, while Nvidia plummeted almost 7%.
Trump also set the stage to tariff semiconductors this week — the Commerce Department opened a probe into computer chips Tuesday under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which grants the president the ability to impose levies on imports due to national security. And Trump has promised that most electronics will still get wrapped up in his tariffs, which could hurt Apple.
"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations," he posted Sunday.

"I just think that we've got to, we've got to be a little patient to see how some of these things play out," Schmid said in a webcast conversation with Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Lorie Logan at a Dallas Fed event.  At the end of the day, he said, the Fed will "react in a positive way to any of those disruptions that might affect that dual mandate," referring to the Fed's mandates of achieving both price stability and full employment.
SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's central bank on Thursday signalled it would cut rates in May and left the door wide open to further monetary easing to cope with "significant" risks to the economy from U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policy.  After the Bank of Korea's seven-member board held the benchmark interest rate at 2.75% as expected at its monetary policy review earlier in the day, Governor Rhee Chang-yong emphasised the BOK's readiness to respond to economic uncertainties.  "Leaving me aside, all six board members are open to an interest rate cut when we look at the policy path for the three months ahead," Rhee said at a press conference.
Japanese chemical company Zeon aims to decide by the summer whether to move forward with plans it put on hold to expand production in the United States, its CEO said.  Zeon in January froze plans to expand capacity in Texas for producing binders used in lithium-ion batteries.  The company was uncertain over the outlook for the electric vehicle market following the election of President Donald Trump.
All is not lost when it comes to investing in Nvidia. Here's what Lawrence McDonald of the Bear Traps Report has to say.
(Reuters) -The ripple effects of Donald Trump's global trade war are increasingly being felt across numerous industries all at once and on Wednesday were once again exerting pressure on U.S. stock markets that have been roiled for weeks by his erratic trade policies.  Stocks fell broadly, with tech stocks hit particularly hard after bellwethers like Nvidia that are highly tied into the world's supply chain warned of hits to their bottom line.  Meanwhile, airlines said they are bracing for an uncertain summer travel season, and the head of the Federal Reserve noted slowing economic activity - but also cast a wary eye on the threat that tariffs pose to its goal of lowering inflation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors who may have been hoping the Federal Reserve is poised to come to the aid of tariff-rattled markets took away an unwelcome message from the central bank's chief on Wednesday: the Fed may be in a bind.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank would wait for more data on the economy's direction before changing interest rates.  Speaking to the Economic Club of Chicago, he noted that there was a potentially tough situation developing for the Fed in which inflation is pushed higher by tariffs while growth and potentially, employment, weaken.
BEIJING (Reuters) -China will pay no attention if the United States continues to play the "tariff numbers game", China's foreign ministry said on Thursday, after the White House outline how China faces tariffs of up to 245% due to its retaliatory actions.  In a fact sheet released on Tuesday, the White House said China's total duties include the latest reciprocal tariff of 125%, a 20% tariff to address the fentanyl crisis, and tariffs of between 7.5% and 100% on specific goods to address unfair trade practices.
Other companies hit hard include a medical device maker, a semiconductor firm and the maker of Vans sneakers.
