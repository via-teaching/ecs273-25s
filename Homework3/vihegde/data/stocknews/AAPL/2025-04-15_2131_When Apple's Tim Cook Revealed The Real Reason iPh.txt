Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook previously explained the company’s decision to continue manufacturing its products in China, refuting the widespread belief that it’s due to low labor costs.
What Happened: A 2024 video of Tim Cook has resurfaced, providing insights into Apple’s manufacturing choices amid the ongoing U.S.-China tariff war. In the video, posted on X by CNBC TV18 reporter Nigel D’Souza, Cook dismissed the idea that Apple’s manufacturing in China is due to low labor costs, stating, “China stopped being a low labor cost company many years ago.”

Instead, he emphasized China’s unparalleled skilled labor concentration in one location and advanced tooling capabilities as the primary reason. Cook emphasized that “the products that we do require truly advanced tooling.”
On that note, Cook emphasized the sharp difference in vocational skills between the US and China. The Apple CEO stated, "In the US, you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I’m not we could fill the room." In China, however, "you could fill multiple football fields.... Hence, the vocational expertise in China is very deep”.
Why It Matters: The U.S.-China tariff war has put pressure on American companies to shift production back home. Earlier this month, a leading tech analyst predicted a significant price hike for Apple iPhones if manufacturing shifts to the U.S., potentially reaching around $3,500. This is due to the complexity of recreating the production ecosystem that currently exists in Asia.

Furthermore, experts opined that Apple’s supply chain could face major disruptions due to new reciprocal tariffs. Apple had temporarily dodged steep tariffs on Chinese-made electronics following an exemption granted by Trump.
A recent report also suggested that Apple completed an urgent logistics operation, transporting five planeloads of iPhones and other products from manufacturing centers in India and China to the U.S. within 72 hours, in a bid to beat President Donald Trump's new 10% reciprocal tariff on imports.
Given these complexities, Cook’s emphasis on China’s skilled labor and advanced tooling capabilities provides a clearer understanding of Apple’s manufacturing decisions.
Apple has lost over $500 billion in market capitalization since the Apr 2 ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs. On Friday, the stock climbed 4.06% to close at $198.15, as per Benzinga Pro.
Apple holds a momentum rating of 62.11% and a quality rating of 86.50%, according to Benzinga's Proprietary Edge Rankings. For an in-depth report on more stocks and insights into growth opportunities, sign up for Benzinga Edge.

President Donald Trump's import tariffs have been the big subject for investors in recent weeks, with any new announcement guiding the market's direction.  The Magnificent Seven stocks led gains in the Nasdaq Composite last year, but today, these tech players are pushing the index lower amid concerns about how Trump's tariffs will impact them.  Each Magnificent Seven player is likely to be impacted to a certain degree, but my prediction is one particular stock is the safest of the bunch during the tariff turmoil.
Buying stocks when overall markets are falling can seem dangerous and counterintuitive.  A great example would have been buying shares of quality companies amid the market chaos of 2020.  While it wasn't an easy time to buy stocks given the uncertainty ahead, doing so could have resulted in some significant gains for investors.
It's been a rough start to 2025, with the S&P 500 having its worst quarter since 2022 followed by escalating trade tensions in April.
