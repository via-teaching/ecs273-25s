WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. retail sales increased by the most in more than two years in March as households stepped up purchases of motor vehicles and a range of other goods to avoid higher prices from tariffs, likely barely keeping the economy afloat in the first quarter.  Economists' gross domestic product growth estimates for the January-March quarter remained stuck below a 0.5% annualized rate, keeping intact investors' fears of stagnant growth and high inflation, commonly referred to as stagflation.  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at an Economic Club of Chicago event on Wednesday acknowledged the economy appeared to have slowed last quarter, noting "inflation is likely to go up as tariffs find their way and some part of those tariffs come to be paid by the public."
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in prepared remarks in Chicago that the central bank would wait for more data before changing interest rates.
NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks ended sharply lower on Wednesday as Nvidia warned about steep charges from new U.S. curbs on its chip exports to China and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said U.S. economic growth appears to be slowing.

The Fed chair's afternoon comments sparked further selling in stocks, which had already been under pressure from a sharp drop in shares of Nvidia and other chipmakers.
Stocks opened lower on Wednesday after the latest trade headlines hit Nvidia and other tech stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 310 points, or 0.8%. The S&P 500 was down 1.4%. The Nasdaq Composite was down 2.
