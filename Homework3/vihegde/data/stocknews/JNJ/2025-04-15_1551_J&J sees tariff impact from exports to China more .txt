Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported a beat on first quarter earnings Tuesday, even as concerns linger about how President Trump's tariffs will impact its medical device business, as well as how a probe into pharmaceutical tariffs will impact its business.
J&J reported first quarter revenue of $21.9 billion, beating Wall Street estimates by 1.4%. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.69, beating Wall Street by 6.7%. Despite the beat, J&J's stock traded down less than 1% Tuesday.
The company raised its 2025 sales guidance Tuesday by $700 million, putting the new target at 3.3% to 4.3% growth, or a midpoint of $92 billion. That is despite a decline in sales after the patent expiry of Stelara, the company's blockbuster inflammatory condition treatment, this year.
On an earnings call Tuesday, executives said that China, Canada, and Mexico are where the company has the most exposure on tariffs.
CFO Joe Wolk estimated about $400 million in tariff impact, saying it would primarily hit the medical devices business.
"It would include, to some small degree, some of the steel and aluminum tariffs that impact some of our products. It includes the China tariffs, as well as the China retaliatory tariffs — and that is probably the most substantial out of all the tariffs," Wolk said.
He told Yahoo Finance that up to 70% of the tariff impact is from the products exported to China from the U.S.
The hit from tariffs is being taken on as cost of goods and will "sit on the balance sheet ... in future periods," Wolk said.
Asad Haider, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research head of the healthcare business unit, told Yahoo Finance that the company reduced its research costs and also has a lot more leverage, due to its size, to whether the current tariff confusion.
"We don't really know line items...it speaks a little bit to the leverage they have across the P&L to make these types of investments," Haider said.
The industry is also bracing for the impact of the investigation into pharmaceutical tariffs, which the Trump administration announced Monday.
However, CEO Joaquin Duato said, "It is also important that companies in healthcare partner with the administration to look to mitigate some of the vulnerabilities that exist today in our healthcare supply chain so as to avoid any continuity of supply effect."
J&J has also faced some of the same industry pressures as its peers in recent years, including the Inflation Reduction Act's Medicare price negotiations. But it is also pressured by the ongoing talc litigation and recently faced a major setback in the courts, with a judge rejecting a potential $10 billion settlement.
J&J has since returned about $7 billion from the intended settlement amount back to the company's coffers and is pursuing a different legal avenue that should play out in the second half of the year, according to analysts.
"Although JNJ’s effort to resolve talc litigation through Red River Talc bankruptcy failed, the company will return to the tort system to challenge plaintiffs’ experts via Daubert motions. JNJ expects important Daubert hearings and rulings within 6 months (by the end of Oct 2025)," wrote Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger in a note to clients Tuesday.

Health care giant Johnson & Johnson expects about $400 million in tariff-related costs this year.  The costs will be felt primarily within the company's medical technology unit, which makes a range of medical devices and surgical products.  The most substantial impact comes from tariffs against China and retaliatory tariffs from China, said Joseph Wolk, Johnson & Johnson's chief financial officer, in a conference call with analysts following the company's latest earnings results.
Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) reported on Tuesday that the first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenue growth was 3% year-over-year and was $21.6 billion, beating the analyst consensus of $21.29 billion.

The U.S. banking giant reported earnings per share of $1.96, increased from $1.58 a year ago, beating the consensus of $1.84. Also Read: JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, M
Johnson & Johnson plans to seek a U.S. indication for multiple general surgery procedures, including gastric bypass, which was performed in the clinical trial.
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of 7.78% and 1.26%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 2025. Do the numbers hold clues to what lies ahead for the stock?
Futures edged down Tuesday morning, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow trading just below break-even, as investors braced for a flurry of corporate earnings. The muted open followed Monday’s tech-led rally, which briefly masked deeper market jitters tied to tariffs and macro uncertainty.
New tariffs, primarily on medical technology products, are projected to add $400 million in costs this year, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said.
Johnson & Johnson is holding its earnings outlook steady despite President Donald Trump signaling he could put tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry. The administration announced earlier it would conduct an investigation into drug imports. That move is widely seen as a first step toward imposing new levies. Earnings and revenue both beat estimates for the quarter. Johnson & Johnson CFO Joe Wolk joined Bloomberg Open Interest to talk about how tariffs could hit the industry and the drug maker's bottom line.
President Donald Trump’s latest trade move is hitting the gas pedal on car sales. With a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and parts set to take effect, buyers are racing to dealerships to lock in prices before they climb. Some industry experts say it could add thousands of dollars to the cost of a new car, prompting a last-minute shopping spree.
