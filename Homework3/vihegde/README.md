## Academic Integrity Acknowledgement
The following tasks in this project were assisted by ChatGPT:

- Debugging and troubleshooting code (particularly for visualizations).
- Providing explanations on concepts such as t-SNE, LSTM autoencoders, and confusion matrices.
- Understanding inner workings of React.js and D3.js using TypeScript.

While the primary work was done independently, ChatGPT provided helpful guidance and suggestions throughout the process.
