Originally selling Japanese Onitsuka Tiger sneakers as Blue Ribbon Sports, Nike (NYSE:NKE) is a global titan in athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories.

Underwhelming constant currency revenue performance over the past two years suggests its product offering at current prices doesn’t resonate with customers
Forecasted revenue decline of 6.3% for the upcoming 12 months implies demand will fall even further
Shrinking returns on capital suggest that increasing competition is eating into the company’s profitability

Originally a division of American Airlines, Sabre (NASDAQ:SABR) is a technology provider for the global travel and tourism industry.
Why Should You Dump SABR?
Number of total bookings has disappointed over the past two years, indicating weak demand for its offerings
Poor free cash flow margin of -0.8% for the last two years limits its freedom to invest in growth initiatives, execute share buybacks, or pay dividends
Short cash runway increases the probability of a capital raise that dilutes existing shareholders
Sabre’s stock price of $2.16 implies a valuation ratio of 11.7x forward price-to-earnings. To fully understand why you should be careful with SABR, check out our full research report (it’s free).

Why Will WAB Outperform?

Performance over the past two years was turbocharged by share buybacks, which enabled its earnings per share to grow faster than its revenue
Free cash flow margin expanded by 7.1 percentage points over the last five years, providing additional flexibility for investments and share buybacks/dividends
Wabtec is trading at $172.20 per share, or 19.9x forward price-to-earnings. Is now the time to initiate a position? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it’s free.
