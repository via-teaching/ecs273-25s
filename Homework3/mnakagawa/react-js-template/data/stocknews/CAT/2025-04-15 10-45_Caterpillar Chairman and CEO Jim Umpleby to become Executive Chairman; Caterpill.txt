In 2021, he was promoted to Group President of Energy & Transportation. Effective November 1, 2023, Creed was appointed to the newly created position of Chief Operating Officer. "For 100 years, our incredible people have been the foundation of Caterpillar's success," said Creed. "I'm proud to work alongside our talented Caterpillar employees and dealers as we continue to support customers across our diverse businesses, from disaster recovery and building the world's infrastructure to delivering critical minerals and reliable energy. I look forward to leading this amazing team as we build upon Caterpillar's legacy of excellence." Debra L. Reed-Klages, who has served as a Director since June 2015, will remain on the Board as independent Presiding Director, a position she has held since June 2022.
