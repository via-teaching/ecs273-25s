# How to Run

I created `server.cjs` to fetch news from the `/stocknews` , as it wasn't recognized in my enviorment (but `/stockdata` was)

1. Install Required Packages

```zsh
npm install express
npm install cors
```

2. Start the Server

```zsh
node server.cjs
```

3. Start the Frontend (in a separate terminal)
```zsh
npm run dev
```
