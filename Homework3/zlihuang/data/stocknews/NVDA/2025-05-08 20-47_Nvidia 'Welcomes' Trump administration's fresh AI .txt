May 8 - NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) said it welcomes the Trump administration's move to scrap the AI Diffusion rule, calling the potential repeal a once?in?a?generation opportunity to lead the next industrial revolution and create high?paying U.S. jobs.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.
The AI Diffusion rule, adopted late in the Biden era, would have capped exports of advanced AI chips to foreign adversaries by sorting countries into three tiers based on strategic risk. It was scheduled to take effect May 15.
Bloomberg reported the administration plans to kill the rule as part of a broader rollback of semiconductor export curbs. The repeal isn't final, and uncertainty around timing has left some investors cautious.
Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said he expects additional developments around the policy shift but warned that overhang will likely persist until details are clear. We'll take even a temporary reprieve, he wrote, though the issue is probably not put to bed.
Based on the one year price targets offered by 50 analysts, the average target price for NVIDIA Corp is $163.43 with a high estimate of $235.92 and a low estimate of $100.00. The average target implies a upside of +38.18% from the current price of $118.28.
