Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) CEO Jensen Huang said U.S. limits on AI chip exports to China are costing the company billions and holding back the broader economy. At the Milken Institute Conference, he said easing export restrictions could help bring back U.S. jobs and tax revenue, framing it as an opportunity to bolster American tech leadership.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.
The company is bracing for a $5.5 billion quarterly charge after the Trump administration restricted shipments of Nvidia's H20 chips to China without a license. The move, tied to national security concerns, blocks access to a market Huang described as utterly gigantic.
Huang argued that opening chip flows would help restore U.S. tax dollars and jobs, calling current restrictions a missed chance to support the economy. His comments come as Nvidia leads the global AI chip race but faces pressure from tightening trade rules.
Other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, Financials) could also feel the impact as the U.S.-China tech standoff drags on.
Investors will be watching for updates on policy shifts and how they may affect Nvidia's future growth.
