Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) welcomes the Trump administration's move to revoke the AI Diffusion rule, calling it a once-in-a-generation opportunity to secure U.S. leadership in AI and bolster high-paying domestic jobs.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.
The AI Diffusion rule, enacted under the Biden administration and set to kick in on May 15, would have imposed tiered export limits on advanced AI chips to curb foreign access. In a post on X, Nvidia said revoking the rule unlocks potential to build new U.S.-supplied infrastructure and narrow the trade deficit, signaling relief for chipmakers and data-center operators reliant on global sales.
Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon noted that while the rule's rollback isn't finalized and overhang remains, even a temporary reprieve is welcome given the uncertain timeline for full clarity.
Nvidia shares ticked up as investors digested the news. Rasgon cautioned in his note that more policy shifts are likely and that the market will remain cautious until the administration publicly confirms the repeal.
He added that any further changes to semiconductor trade restrictions could sway sentiment, but for now, the potential restoration of unencumbered chip exports is viewed positively.
Why it matters: Lifting the AI Diffusion rule could accelerate Nvidia's AI-driven revenue growth by reopening key markets and reinforcing America's role in the next industrial revolution.
Investors will watch for official Federal Register notices and subsequent trade-policy updatesexpected over the coming weeksto gauge the permanence of this policy change and its impact on chipmakers' global strategies.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese real wages decreased for a third consecutive month in March against the background of relentless inflation, while overtime salaries fell at the fastest pace in almost a year, government data showed on Friday.  The pay data will add to worries over Japan's growth outlook, alongside tariff threats and uncertainty over monetary policy, ahead of a first-quarter gross domestic product announcement next week.  Inflation-adjusted real wages, a key determinant of households' purchasing power, dropped 2.1% in March from a year earlier following a revised 1.5% fall in February and a 2.8% decline in January, labour ministry data showed.
