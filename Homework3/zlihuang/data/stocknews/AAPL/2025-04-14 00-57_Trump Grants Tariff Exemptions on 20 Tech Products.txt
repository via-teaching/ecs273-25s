President Donald Trump has announced exemptions from tariffs for a range of technology products, including smartphones, laptops, chips, and other electronics, easing pressure on tech companies that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed that items like semiconductors, solar cells, memory cards, modems, and flat panel displays will not be subject to the new reciprocal tariffs. The exemptions, backdated to April 5, apply to products that had already shipped before the announcement.
The policy shift follows the Trump administration’s earlier decision to impose 145% tariffs on Chinese imports and a baseline 10% tariff on goods from most other countries. Trump later introduced a 90-day pause for non-retaliating countries, but China remained subject to the full rate due to its own 84% tariffs on U.S. goods. The White House stated the exemptions were intended to give companies more time to move production to the United States. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasized that the country cannot depend on China to manufacture key technologies, and Deputy Press Secretary Kush Desai said firms are now “hustling” to onshore production.
Tech executives and investors had warned the tariffs could cause significant price increases for consumer electronics, with some estimates suggesting U.S. iPhone prices could have tripled. Apple, which manufactures around 80% of iPads and more than half of its Mac computers in China, has reportedly been accelerating its shift to India and Vietnam for production. The U.S. is a major market for Apple, which accounted for more than half of U.S. smartphone sales last year.
Financial markets responded quickly to the exemptions. The S&P 500 surged more than 10% following the announcement of the 90-day pause, while Bitcoin climbed past $85,000. Analysts noted that crypto markets, often correlated with tech stocks, were boosted by renewed investor confidence. Macroeconomic trader Raoul Pal described the tariffs as a negotiation tactic, and Max Keiser argued that exempting certain goods would not stop bond yields from rising.
Despite the policy change, a 20% tariff related to Chinese fentanyl-linked products still applies to the exempted items. Stephen Miller, White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, confirmed this on social media. Meanwhile, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a local high of 4.5% on April 11, reflecting investor uncertainty over the broader trade strategy.
Trump, speaking to reporters while traveling to Florida, said the administration would provide more specific details soon. He maintained support for the tariffs overall, describing the revenue generated as beneficial for the U.S. economy and expressing optimism about ongoing trade talks with China.
The iPhone is exempt from the White House’s latest escalation of the trade war with China, the Trump administration quietly announced late Friday.  At one point,  Apple  had lost almost $800 billion of market value after Trump officials claimed imposing sky-high tariffs on Chinese-made goods would shift iPhone assembly to American factories.  Instead, President  Trump  blinked—again.
The episode is a great lesson for all investors, veteran investor says.
President Trump’s tariff exemptions on some electronics are the latest twist in U.S. trade policy and could benefit companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Dell, Samsung and others that manufacture some products abroad.

President Trump's move Friday to give big tech companies a tariff break may give markets a boost on Monday.
Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are currently 26% below their peak from December last year (as of April 10), a drop that has been spurred by ongoing tariff announcements.  As of this writing, there is a huge 145% tariff that's implemented on goods leaving China for the U.S. If this remains in place, it could harm Apple, because 80% of its production is still based in China, according to estimates from Evercore.  If the increased costs are eaten by Apple, on the other hand, its profitability will definitely take a hit.
