(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs on Monday reduced its forecast for aluminium prices this year after its economists downgraded global growth forecasts including for the U.S. and China following the Trump administration's move to sharply increase tariffs.
"We now expect the aluminium price to fall to a monthly average low of $2,000 (per metric ton) in Q3 2025," the bank said in a note.
Goldman expects prices to rebound to $2,300 per metric ton (/t) by December 2025, compared to its earlier forecast of $2,650/t. London Metals Exchange (LME) aluminium was trading at around $2,392/t as of 1300 GMT on Monday.
U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed or floated plans for a series of global tariffs since his return to office, including 25% tariffs on steel, aluminium and auto parts alongside major tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.
Aluminium, a lightweight and corrosion-resistant metal, plays a critical role across industries including transportation, packaging, and electronics.
Trump said on Sunday that he would be announcing the tariff rate on imported semiconductors this week.
Goldman also forecast a global aluminium market surplus of 580,000 tons in 2025, versus its previous forecast of a 76,000 tons deficit.
It attributed this to a downward revision to its global total aluminium demand growth forecast to 1.1% year-on-year in 2025 and 2.3% in 2026, as the bank expects a hit from weaker global GDP growth. Previously it had expected demand growth of 2.6% this year and 2.4% in 2026.
Goldman said it still expects aluminium prices to go up after 2025, but not as much as it estimated before, as the extra supply built up during 2025–2026 will help soften the rise.
According to the note, aluminium prices will be at $2,720/t by December 2026, instead of $3,100 forecast previously, and average around $2,800 per ton in 2027, when Goldman sees the market entering a 722,000 tons deficit.

HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — China's leader Xi Jinping started a week of diplomacy in Southeast Asia with a visit to Vietnam on Monday, signaling China's commitment to global trade, just after U.S. President Donald Trump upended the global economy with his latest tariffs moves.
LONDON (AP) — Social media company Meta said Monday that it will start using publicly available content from European users to train its artificial intelligence models, resuming work put on hold last year after activists raised concerns about data privacy.
BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — The operator of the Keystone oil pipeline restarted the system Monday after a spill onto farmland in North Dakota last week shut down the line.
Turbulence unleashed by President Donald Trump's tariffs could rock global shipments of shrimp to the United States, with exporters in biggest supplier India saying they endanger 2,000 containers packed with the frozen delicacy.  But Ecuador, thousands of kilometres nearer to the United States faces a lower tariff rate and stands to benefit, the exporters say, as shrimp is its most important export after oil.  India's shrimp industry is staring at a tariff of 26% under Trump's July plan, which threatens a thriving $7-billion seafood export market heavily reliant on U.S. supermarket chains such as Walmart and Kroger as buyers look to renegotiate rates.
The deal comes at a time when electricity prices are rapidly increasing in PJM, the United States' biggest power market, and as demand for electricity continues to increase on the back of the proliferation of energy-guzzling AI data centers and the electrification of transportation and buildings.  Capital Power said it would buy power plant operators Hummel Station Intermediate Holdings III and Rolling Hills Generating Holdings from LS Power Equity Advisors.  Hummel Station owns a 1,124 megawatt (MW) combined-cycle natural gas facility in Shamokin Dam, Pennsylvania, while Rolling Hills owns the 1,023 MW combustion turbine natural gas facility in Wilkesville, Ohio.
LONDON (Reuters) -OPEC cut its 2025 global oil demand growth forecast on Monday for the first time since December, citing the impact of data received for the first quarter and trade tariffs announced by the United States.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, in a monthly report, said world oil demand would rise by 1.30 million barrels per day in 2025 and by 1.28 million bpd in 2026.  Both forecasts are down 150,000 bpd from last month's figures.
The bank cut its 2025 Brent price forecast to $66 per barrel from $73 and its 2026 target to $58 from $61.  It lowered the 2025 WTI price outlook to $62 per barrel from $69 and the 2026 view to $53 from $57.  Brent crude futures were trading around $65 on Monday, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were around $61.
Tech stocks have grown exponentially in the past two years, with 2023 being a banner year for the sector.  The Nasdaq 100 technology sector index rose nearly 7% in 2024, having soared 66.7% the year before.  The use of artificial intelligence has also boosted attention towards the sector, with venture funding firms keen on financing companies leveraging the technology.
(Reuters) -Apple took the top spot for global smartphone sales in the first quarter on the back of the iPhone 16e's launch and strong demand in countries such as Japan and India, data from Counterpoint Research showed on Monday.  Apple had 19% of the smartphone market, despite flat or declining sales in the U.S., Europe and China, followed by Samsung with 18% of the market, according to Counterpoint.  The data suggests iPhone demand remains strong in emerging markets, even as sales struggle in China due to competition from local players such as Huawei and a lack of AI features.
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday suggested that he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs he previously imposed on the sector, to give carmakers time to adjust their supply chains.
