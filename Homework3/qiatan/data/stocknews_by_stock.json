Thanks to the Fed’s series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump’s presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by potential trade policy changes and corporate tax discussions, which could impact business confidence and growth. The path forward holds both optimism and caution as new policies take shape. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out ourTop 6 Stocksand add them to your watchlist.

Caterpillar (CAT) on Tuesday named Joseph Creed as the company's next chief executive, succeeding D. Paxos’ Global Dollar Network (USDG) also includes Kraken, Galaxy Digital, Anchorage Digital, Bullish (the owner of CoinDesk) and Nuvei. Respondents to BofA's monthly survey of fund managers were a net 36% underweight U.S. equities, the most in nearly two years, a number that has plunged by 53 percentage points since February, the biggest such fall on their records.  The trend looks set to continue, as a record number of respondents also said they intended to cut allocations to U.S. equities.  U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff plans have sparked a selloff in U.S. assets, including stocks, the dollar and Treasury bonds. U.S. stocks drifted Tuesday through a rare quiet day for financial markets.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 155 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite edged down by less than 0.1%.  The modest moves offered some respite following the huge swings that have battered Wall Street recently, not just day to day but also hour to hour. Recently, Zacks.com users have been paying close attention to Caterpillar (CAT). This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store. LVMH lost its position on Tuesday as Europe's largest luxury company in terms of market capitalization after being overtaken by rival Hermes due to investor pessimism after disappointing first-quarter revenue from the sector bellwether.

Caterpillarrecently announced a significant executive leadership change, with Joseph E. Creed appointed as the new CEO effective May 1, 2025. This leadership transition, along with adjustments to executive compensation, appears timely with the company's stock seeing a 6% rise last week. This move aligned closely with broader market trends where major indexes were buoyed by tech and bank stocks amid easing U.S.-China trade tensions. Within this context, Caterpillar's announcements likely added positive sentiment, supporting the stock's alignment with the market's upward trajectory, which saw a similar 7% climb over the same period. We've identified 2 possible red flags with Caterpillar and understanding the impact should be part of your investment process. Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 20 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit. The recent leadership change at Caterpillar, with Joseph E. Creed stepping in as CEO, might further solidify the company's strategic focus on sustainability and growth in alternative fuel markets. This aligns with Caterpillar's ongoing investments in capacity expansion and new technologies, potentially improving long-term revenue growth. While recent executive changes have buoyed short-term sentiment, impacting weekly stock performance positively, the firm's share price also reflects longstanding investor confidence with a total return of 186.72% over the last five years. This context frames a robust performance relative to the broader US market and offers a clear view of its trajectory beyond near-term fluctuations. Analysis shows Caterpillar's shares are somewhat discounted compared to the consensus analyst price target of US$365.99, which indicates potential upward movement of over 20%. If the new leadership can successfully navigate near-term challenges such as lower sales volumes and an unfavorable product mix, revenue and earnings forecasts could improve in line with market expectations. A focus on high-margin services and strategic capital deployment could further enhance shareholder returns despite potential revenue pressures in certain sectors. As the company continues to pursue its sustainability goals, any advancements could further align with long-term market trends, potentially justifying current and future valuations.

Caterpillar(CAT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Over the past month, shares of this construction equipment company have returned -13%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Manufacturing - Construction and Mining industry, which Caterpillar falls in, has lost 12%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. Caterpillar is expected to post earnings of $4.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.9%. The consensus earnings estimate of $19.41 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -11.4%. This estimate has changed -1.7% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.69 indicates a change of +11.7% from what Caterpillar is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.2%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Caterpillar. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Caterpillar, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.61 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -7.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $62.51 billion and $65.47 billion estimates indicate -3.6% and +4.7% changes, respectively. Caterpillar reported revenues of $16.22 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5%. EPS of $5.14 for the same period compares with $5.23 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.64 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.57%. The EPS surprise was +3.42%. Over the last four quarters, Caterpillar surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters. No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Caterpillar is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Caterpillar. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investing.com -- Caterpillar’s appointment of insider Joe Creed as its next chief executive, was dubbed a “well-telegraphed transition” by Wall Street that ensures strategic continuity at a pivotal time for the construction and machinery giant. Creed, chief operating officer, will succeed longtime CEO Jim Umpleby on May 1.Umpleby, who ledCaterpillar(NYSE:CAT) through a multiyear operational turnaround, will become executive chairman. Barclays said the internal promotion brings “no surprises” and reflects a succession process that’s been “quasi investor-facing for several years.”Brokerage noted Creed’s strong background in both engineering and finance, two areas investors closely watch, positions him to carry forward the company’s focus on operational discipline, aftermarket growth, and capital efficiency. “Creed is a known entity to capital markets,” Barclays said, pointing to his appearances in investor settings and past roles, including interim CFO and head of the Energy & Transportation segment. Oppenheimer echoed the view, saying the timing, aligned with Caterpillar’s 100th anniversary, signals continuity and confidence.“While Mr. Creed will be stepping into the role at a challenging part in the cycle and amid a dynamic macro backdrop, we believe the well-telegraphed internal succession, and Mr. Umpleby’s transition to Executive Chairman likely limits the impact on shares,” the firm wrote. Creed, a 28-year Caterpillar veteran, has held leadership posts across key business units including Electric Power, Oil & Gas, and Marine. He was named COO in October 2023, widely seen as a precursor to his elevation to CEO. Analysts highlighted Creed’s leadership in Energy & Transportation as key to Caterpillar’s evolving strategy.Barclays noted investor focus on the segment has grown alongside demand for data centers and power generation, where Caterpillar sees potential for competitive differentiation. Umpleby’s tenure is credited with restoring stability and profitability through a renewed focus on core businesses.Barclays said his leadership saw Caterpillar streamline its operations, prioritize R&D, and make selective, strategic acquisitions like the $400 million deal for Weir’s Oil & Gas unit.

Caterpillar's shares were up 1% in morning trade. They have lost nearly 18% of their value this year. \"Historically, this means there will be consistency and continuity rather than any big changes in strategy or tactics,\" Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann said. \"I would not expect any meaningful changes at the company for at least a year or two, if at all.\" Caterpillar had reaped the benefits of former President Joe Biden's 2021 infrastructure law - a $1 trillion enactment aimed at upgrading roads, bridges and other transport infrastructure. However, the initial demand surge waned as due to high borrowing costs and persistent inflation. Several contractors are also adopting a wait-and-see approach to buying new machinery against the backdrop of mounting uncertainty over government spending under the Trump administration. The company, set to report first-quarter results later this month, has forecast a slight decline in sales for 2025.

The letter, signed by senators Pete Ricketts, Tommy Tuberville and Thom Tillis, argues that the AI diffusion rule will damage U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence and calls for \"immediate action\" to halt it before it takes effect on May 15.  \"Every day this rule remains in place, American companies face mounting uncertainty, stalled investments, and the risk of losing critical global partnerships that cannot be easily regained,\" said the letter, which was also signed by senators Markwayne Mullin, Ted Budd, Roger Wicker and Eric Schmitt.

      "content": "Apple (AAPL) shares wavered between gains and losses in early trading Tuesday after posting gains Monday on the Trump administration’s decision totemporarily exempt many electronic goods from import tariffs. Apple, which assembles a majority of its devices in China, has seen its stock come under considerable pressure in recent weeks amid an intensifying trade war between Washington and Beijing that has resulted inescalating tit-for-tat tariffs, prompting concerns that increasing manufacturing costs could weigh on consumer demand. The iPhone maker’s shares rebounded 5% last week but have lost about a fifth of their value since the start of the year. By comparison, theS&P 500jumped 6% last week and is down about 8% for the year so far. Below, we break down thetechnicalson Apple’s chart and point out crucial price levels worth watching. After setting theirrecord highin late December, Apple shares have trended lower, possibly completing anElliott Wavepattern, with five distinct price swings after which sentiment typically shifts. The stock appeared to gain momentum in recent trading sessions following last Wednesday’srecord-breaking relief rallythat saw the stock log its largest one-day gain in nearly three decades. The shares have recorded above-averagevolumesince President Trump announced sweeping tariffs earlier this month, signaling increased trading activity as market participants position for further news-driven price swings.

This area on the chart may provide support near ahorizontal linethat connects a range ofprice actionstretching back to January last year.

Investors may look to scoop up shares in this region near last week’s low, which also closely aligns with a period ofsideways drifton the chart throughout March and April last year. Further buying this week could see the shares touch overhead resistance around $220. Tactical traders who haveaccumulated sharesat lower levels may decide tolock in profitsin this region near a trendline that links last June’s prominentpeakwith several troughs spanning from July to January. Finally, abreakoutabove this area could trigger a move to the $247 level.

Apple (AAPL) will effectively develop Apple Intelligence, while \"new form factors\" will boost the tech giant's 2026 revenue, Angelo Zino, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research predicted recently on the Schwab Network. Zino has a $235 price target and a Buy rating on the shares. A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Apple's Positive Catalysts The development of Apple Intelligence, which will become \"more accessible\" in China, will enable the demand for the iPhone 17 to be strong,  Zino asserted. Further, \"new form factors\" that will be launched by the firm, such as foldables, will boost its revenue in 2026, according to the analyst. Turning to Services, Zino predicts that the business will continue to grow at an annual rate of about 9%, providing another positive catalyst for AAPL stock. Apple \"Can Work With\" the Tariffs, Zino Says Apple is likely to end up with \"a blended tariff\" of 10%-30% on its products, based on the combination of hardware that it will import from China and India, Zino estimated. At those levels, the company can increase its prices \"moderately,\" preventing both \"meaningful demand destruction\" and significant gross margin declines, the analyst predicted.

Apple (AAPL,Financials) shares climbed about 2% to close at $202.52 on Monday after KeyBancupgraded the stock, citing the company's exemption from a new round of U.S. tariffs on tech imports. The firm raised its rating on Apple to sector weight from underweight following the Trump administration's decision to exclude smartphones, computers, and other electronics from the latest reciprocal tariffs. KeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel said in a note that the decision significantly reduces the downside risk from a prolonged trade conflict between the United States and China. Citi maintained its outperform rating on Apple but lowered its sales projections for iPhones, Macs, and wearables. The bank cited expectations of a global economic slowdown due to the broader impact of tariffs, even as Apple's core products received exemptions. According to Citi, Apple remains vulnerable to weakening macroeconomic conditions. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the tariff exemption is not permanent and that the administration could introduce new tariffs within the next two months. That raises questions about how long the trade relief will benefit Apple and other tech companies. Wedbush, which also has an outperform rating on the stock, said the temporary nature of the exemption creates space for potential negotiations between the United States and China. The firm noted that Apple and other major tech companies are closely watching for any developments that could renew trade tensions.

The uncertain macroeconomic environment is diminishing investors’ readiness to pay high prices for stocks related to artificial intelligence. Despite the continued buzz around the technology, no one seems interested in buying the falling stocks. Fluctuating tariff policies from the Trump administration have concerned Wall Street and disrupted global supply chains.

The narrative around AI stocks has also begun to change because investors are critiquing that prices have become too expensive, and because there is intensifying competition from Chinese companies developing their own AI offerings. In the latest news, seven Republican U.S. senators have also sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The letter urges him to get rid of a Biden administration rule that restricts global access to AI chips before it kicks in next month. The letter claims that the AI diffusion rule will deter U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, which is why it demands an “immediate action” to halt it. The rule is set to take effect on May 15. “Every day this rule remains in place, American companies face mounting uncertainty, stalled investments, and the risk of losing critical global partnerships that cannot be easily regained. We urge you to withdraw this rule and propose an alternative that is effective in preventing Communist China from capturing the world market in leading technology without compromising American advantages.” It also noted how the rule puts countries into three tiers, with only 18 nations in the Tier 1 group with the easiest access to American technology. Those in tier 2 have to face “arbitrary purchase limits and a cumbersome licensing process.” Meanwhile, it asserted that Tier 3 countries are already “rightly restricted.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

TARIFFEXEMPTION:According tonew guidancefrom U.S. Customs and Border Protection, PresidentTrumphas exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices and components, including semiconductors, solar cells, flat panel TV displays, flash drives, and memory cards from the reciprocal tariffs imposed on China. White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said in a statement that Trump “has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops.” Desai added, “At the direction of the President, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.” Dan Ives, head of technology research at Wedbush, told CNBC, “This is the dream scenario for tech investors. Smartphones, chips being excluded is a game changer scenario when it comes to China tariffs.” President Donald Trump stated in a Truth Socialpost, “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst! There was no Tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’ The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America, which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate, will mean more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us.” BIG RELIEF:JPMorgan lowered the firm’s price target on Apple(AAPL) to $245 from $270 but kept an Overweight rating on the shares, saying the latest updates from the Trump administration late on Friday, exempting smartphones and PCs from reciprocal tariffs, is a “big relief” for Apple. While the exemption will help return investor focus back to some of the company’s medium-term drivers, “several concerns” remain from the developments over the last two weeks, the firm tells investors in a research note. JPMorgan thinks these will “limit investors from immediately turning to any bull case” for Apple.Semiconductortariffs are still to be announced and could impact Apple, adds the firm. JPMorgan updated its estimates for lower demand from the macro slowdown and potential further downside risk on the resumption of tariffs. It forecasts slowing demand from fiscal Q4 into fiscal 2026 and revised its fiscal 2026 and 2027 iPhone volume expectations to 232M and 242M, respectively, from 249M and 255M units prior. DEPORTATION EFFORTS:Prison operatorGeoGroup(GEO)has built a lucrative side business of digital tools to surveil immigrants on behalf of the federal government over the last decade, making it one of the Trump administration’s big business winners amid deportations, the New York Times’ Paul Mozur, Adam Satariano and Aaron Krolikreport, citing legal aid groups and immigration organizations. The company’s ankle monitors, smart watches and tracking apps are aiding the government by providing the locations of unauthorized immigrants to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and legal groups estimate the number of arrests made from the digital monitoring programs is at least in the hundreds. U.S. STEEL:U.S President Donald Trump reaffirmed that he does not believe a foreign company should control U.S. Steel(X), following similar comments he made regarding the $15B takeover bid by Japan’s Nippon Steel(NPSCY), Reuters’ Jeff Mason and Kantaro Komiyareport, citing remarks Trump made to reporters. On Wednesday, Trump stated that he didn’t want to see the company “go to Japan” causing a 7% drop in the company’s stock value.

After years of teasing the idea, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) isfinallymoving closer to launching its first foldable iPhoneand it's putting all its display chips on one bet. Sources say Apple has chosen Samsung Display as the exclusive supplier for the foldable OLED panels, citing Samsung's (SSNLF) technical lead in minimizing screen creasesarguably the make-or-break feature of a folding phone. Mass production is expected to kick off by late 2025 or early 2026, covering a 7.8-inch main display and a 5.5-inch external screen. For investors, this marks a rare moment when Apple ditches its usual playbook of sourcing from multiple suppliers to drive competition. What's striking is who's not on that list: LG Display. Despite being one of Apple's earliest partners in foldable tech, even co-developing prototype panels back in 2016 and forming a dedicated task force in 2017, LG is now sitting on the sidelines. While Apple's history suggests it could bring in LG for future models if sales scale, this first foldable looks like a one-brand show. The move underscores just how high the bar isand how dominant Samsung's foldable portfolio has become in the premium OLED space. For Samsung Display, this deal isn't just about unitsit's about locking in pole position in the next-gen smartphone race. Apple's validation sends a strong signal to the market that Samsung's tech is years ahead when it comes to crease control and panel reliability. If the iPhone Fold takes off, expect this to be the start of a deeper AppleSamsung hardware alignmentand possibly a wake-up call for LG and BOE to rethink their roadmap.

President Trump on Tuesday again toutedNvidia’s $500 billion commitmentto building AI infrastructure in the US, pledging to expedite the process for the chip giant and any other company planning big US investments. “This is very big and exciting news. All necessary permits will be expedited and quickly delivered to NVIDIA, as they will to all companies committing to be part of the Golden Age of America!” Trump said in a Truth Social post. Nvidia's announcement brings Big Tech’s investment pledges to US AI infrastructure to just north of $1.6 trillion since Trump's inauguration as thetech world tries to navigate the potential hazards of the president's trade war while staying on the right side of a malleable administration. Nvidia, for its part, did seem to make moves in US manufacturing partially due to Trump’s chaotic approach to trade policy, with on-again, off-again global tariffs affecting imports of AI servers containing its highly coveted GPUs, or graphics processing units. Asked about Trump’s tariffs at its annual GTC event in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was \"preparing, and we have been preparing to manufacture onshore.\" Huangreportedly attended a dinner at Mar-a-Lagolast week, after which the Trump administration backed off new restrictions on the company's chip exports to China. Nvidia's moves are the latest in Big Tech's splashy announcements of plans to expand investments within the US. In February, Apple (AAPL)committed to investing $500 billion to expand its US manufacturingover the next four years. TSMC (TSM) — which makes the world's most advanced chips with most of its manufacturing capacity in Taiwan —has committed to spending $100 billionover a similar time frame. The company had previously committed $65 billion to building out its US manufacturing capabilities with funding from the 2022 Chips and Science Act. Just after Trump's inauguration, Oracle (ORCL), OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), and SoftBank (SFTBY) announceda joint venture called Stargate, which the companies said would spend $500 billion on US AI data centers. And after Trump's election, Microsoft (MSFT) said it wouldspend $80 billion to build AI data centers. The company said \"more than half\" of that total would be invested in the US. Apple's US-centric moves have landed in the spotlight again amid Trump's fluctuating tariff policies. Apple announced its $500 billion commitment just days afterTrump said CEO Tim Cookpromised him hundreds of millions of dollars in US investment and implied the pledge was due to his approach to trade policy. \"They don't want to be in the tariffs,\" Trump said in February. However,it’s unclear how much of Apple’s commitment will be from new investments, given that the spending announced was in line with its prior capital expenditures. Nevertheless, Trump's relationship with Cook has weaved its way into tariff developments in the past several days. US Customs and Border Protectionissued regulations late Fridayexempting consumer electronics, networking equipment, and computing products — including GPUs and servers — from reciprocal tariffs. That includes Trump's ever-ballooning 145% levies on China, where Apple still does most of its production. Trump boasted Monday that he \"helped Tim Cook recently.\" \"I don't want to hurt anybody, but the end result is we're going to get to the position of greatness for our country,\" he said. But Trump also set the stage to impose tariffs on semiconductors Tuesday —the Commerce Department opened a probe into computer chips under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which grants the president the authority to impose tariffs on imports seen as essential to national security. And he has promised that most electronics will still get wrapped up in his tariffs. \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,\" he posted Sunday.

By Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Apple's (AAPL) main India suppliers Foxconn and Tata shipped nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones to the United States in March, an all-time high, as the U.S. company airlifted devices to bypass President Donald Trump's impending tariffs, customs data shows. The smartphone maker stepped up production in India and chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tons of iPhones to the United States to ensure sufficient inventory in one of its biggest markets on concern Trump's tariffs would push up costs. In April, the U.S. administration imposed 26% duties on imports from India, much lower than the more than 100% China was facing at the time. Trump has since paused most duties, except for China for three months. Foxconn, Apple's main India supplier, exported smartphones worth $1.31 billion in March, its highest ever for a single month and equal to shipments for January and February combined, according to commercially available customs data reviewed by Reuters. This included Apple iPhone 13, 14, 16 and 16e models, and took Foxconn's total shipments from India to the United States this year to $5.3 billion. Exports from Tata Electronics, another Apple supplier, stood at $612 million in March, around 63% higher than the previous month, and included iPhone 15 and 16 models. Apple, Foxconn and Tata did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters is the first to report the shipment details. Customs data showed all Foxconn shipments to the United States in March were by air from the Chennai Air Cargo terminal, and landed at various locations, including Los Angeles and New York, with Chicago receiving the majority. Trump later granted exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones and some other electronics imported largely from China, but later indicated that those exemptions will likely be short-lived. To expedite shipments, Apple lobbied Indian airport authorities to cut the time needed to clear customs at Chennai airport in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, to six hours down from 30 hours. At least six cargo jets were used in the operation which one source described was a way to \"beat the tariffs\".

In recent days, President Trump and his advisers have given mixed signals on the future of tariffs on China and on specific industries. Over the weekend, big American tech companies scored a victory when it was revealed that the US had not put tariffs on smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics. However, on Sunday, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that these electronics would soon be covered under new tariffs, which would be different from those imposed on specific countries. President Trump also posted on social media that there would be “no exception” for these products. He also said that the government is looking at semiconductors and the entire electronics supply chain in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) from “Underperform” to “Hold” but lowered the price target to $167.88 from the previous $202.33. This adjustment reflects concerns about the potential impacts of a global recession on iPhone demand and the expected price increases for future iPhone models. The analyst noted that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to be exempted from US tariffs because of its commitment to invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years. The analyst believes that the company will make further investments in US manufacturing, possibly including iPhone production. Despite this, a growing risk of a global recession could have a negative impact on iPhone demand. Jefferies has lowered its iPhone shipment forecasts by 3.6%, 7.7%, and 5.5% for fiscal years 2025, 2026, and 2027 respectively, which leads to a reduction in projected revenue by 2%, 4.1%, and 3.5% for the same fiscal years. The firm anticipates that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will raise iPhone prices by $50 in 2026 for the iPhone 18 and by $100 in 2027 for the iPhone 19. These increases in price are expected to be mainly driven by higher hardware costs. Following these revisions, Jefferies now estimates earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) lower than market consensus by 2.5%, 8.5%, and 3.4% for fiscal years 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively. Overall, AAPLranks 6thon our list of the best American tech stocks to buy now.

Apple (AAPL,Financials) isgearing up to launchits first foldable iPhone in the second half of 2026, and it's turning to a familiar rival for help. The company has selected Samsung Display as the exclusive supplier of OLED panels for the device, marking a rare shift from its usual multi-supplier strategy. Industry sources say Apple chose Samsung for its proven ability to reduce screen creasesa crucial issue for foldable phones. The panels will likely resemble those used in the iPad Mini, with a 7.8-inch internal screen and a 5.5-inch external display. Pricing is expected to start around $2,000, putting it head-to-head with Samsung's own Galaxy Z Fold lineup. Samsung Display is expected to start deliveries by late 2025 or early 2026. The exclusive contract could help the company reclaim lost ground in the foldable OLED market, where its share had dropped to about 40% last year. Analysts now expect that number to climb back toward 70% in 2026, boosted by Apple's order. Initial projections put the foldable iPhone's annual production at 9 million units, but some forecasts now see it surpassing 15 million. That kind of volume could breathe new life into the sluggish foldable segment, which saw just 2.9% growth last year, according to Counterpoint Research. The move is also seen as a strategic signal from Appleit's placing quality above price and taking a careful but deliberate step into a new product category. Details like the phone's final design or name haven't been confirmed yet, but its success could shape Apple's future in foldable devices, including iPads and laptops.

Applesaw a notable price increase of 12% over the last week, likely buoyed by the integration announcement of Cardiex Limited's subsidiary, CONNEQT Health, with Apple Health. This integration aligns with broader market trends where tech stocks led indices higher amid President Trump’s tariff exemption for electronics, which added a positive sentiment across the tech sector. Apple's integration with CONNEQT Health is a strategic move to enhance its health-focused offerings, adding depth to its ecosystem. The broader tech rally, including a 7% market gain, added support to Apple's robust performance, painting a positive picture for the week. Apple has 1 weakness we think you should know about. Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 20 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit. The integration of CONNEQT Health with Apple Health potentially enhances Apple's narrative by reinforcing its expansion in health-focused services. This move aligns with anticipated growth across Apple's Services and AI-driven offerings, suggesting a potential rise in earnings and margins as new users are attracted to the upgraded ecosystem. Over the past five years, Apple's total return was 201.35%, highlighting its impressive performance over a longer period. In comparison, Apple outperformed the US Tech industry with a 14.4% return over the last year. The recent share price increase puts it closer to the consensus analyst price target of US$238.01, providing context for investors considering Apple's growth trajectory. With revenue currently at US$395.76 billion and projected to reach US$479.7 billion by 2028, the integration could bolster these figures by driving further customer engagement and sales, especially in emerging markets like India. The anticipated growth in earnings to US$134.3 billion complements the positive sentiment, although risks such as reliance on China and FX headwinds remain considerations.

      "title": "US tariffs: Can Apple manufacture in the US?",
      "date": "2025-04-15 17:23:58",
      "url": "https://www.verdict.co.uk/trump-tariffs-apple-takes-hit/?.tsrc=rss",
      "content": "Whatever the implementation timeline, US tariffs will significantly impact consumer electronics OEMs and telcos. Apple stands out as being particularly vulnerable, with growing pressure to shift its production to the US. But how feasible is all that? On April 11, 2025, just days after announcing new tariffs, the Trump administration exempted smartphones, laptops, processors, displays, and memory chips from tariffs, only to later clarify that this was a temporary reprieve. The US government is set to reassess the entire consumer electronics supply chain amid an investigation into semiconductors, which may soon face tariffs. Earlier last week, the president also announced a 90-day suspension of ‘reciprocal’ tariffs for most trading partners. Concurrently, Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to an unprecedented 145%. This indicates a strong push for US production of consumer devices, including Apple iPhones. The pressing question is whether Apple can manufacture its products domestically. Manufacturing Apple devices in the US is possible but would require significant investment and effort from Apple and governmental bodies, both present and future, with years of business disruption in between. A new GlobalData survey seeks to throw light on the attitudes of global investors towards Mauritius China has developed a robust consumer electronics ecosystem over decades, with a vast network of suppliers, skilled labor, efficient infrastructure, and ample production sites. Consequently, more than half of Apple’s 200 global suppliers are based in China, where a skilled workforce and favourable conditions for large-scale manufacturing exist. Replicating this in the US would necessitate attracting skilled labour, reforming educational pathways, and fostering a culture that values higher education—actions that are not currently aligned with the administration’s policies, as evidenced by the recent immigration uproar and the gutting of the US Department of Education. These tariffs, therefore, appear to be geopolitical trade instruments plainly intended to secure more advantageous agreements. If Apple cannot secure long-term tariff exemptions, then the cost of its devices will likely rise. Currently, 80% of Apple’s overall products are assembled in China, and a 145% tariff could increase the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max to more than $2,600. Apple has begun diversifying production to India and Vietnam, moving about 15-20% of its production there, but remains heavily reliant on China, where 90% of iPhones are still assembled. In the meantime, Apple is stockpiling millions of iPhones, with reports of five planeloads of phones and accessories flying into the US from India in the three days following the April 2 tariff communication. However, the upcoming iPhone 17 series, produced in China, may face tariffs, complicating pricing strategies and potentially dampening consumer demand. Apple faces a potential crisis. Should the company be compelled to shift production to the US, it will encounter insurmountable challenges in meeting its current scale of shipments. The company is at risk of a supply-demand imbalance if forced to shift production to the US, which could lead to higher prices and lost sales. Apple’s challenges are compounded in China, its third largest market, by growing negative American sentiment and competition from local Chinese manufacturers like Huawei and Vivo, which are gaining market share due to their technological advancements, as well as their progressiveness in AI. Additionally, rival Samsung’s diversified supply chain – spread across Vietnam, India, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Korea – gives it a competitive edge, as the company is less over exposed to China compared with Apple. Suffice it to say that Apple has not faced a crisis of this magnitude since its potential bankruptcy in 1997.  The gold standard of business intelligence.

April 15- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has reportedly chosenSamsung Displayas the exclusive supplier of OLED screens for its first foldable iPhone, expected to debut in the second half of 2025. The move sidelines competitors such as LG Display and China's BOE, highlighting Samsung Electronics' (SSNLF) dominance in foldable OLED tech. Samsung's ability to minimize screen creasesa key flaw in current foldableswas said to be a major factor in the decision, the report said. Mass production is expected to begin later this year or in early 2025. The foldable device is rumored to feature a 7.8-inch internal OLED screen, similar in size to the iPad Mini, and a 5.5-inch external display. The price could land near $2,000, putting it in direct competition with Samsung's own Galaxy Z Fold. The production volume is still under discussion, but industry insiders suggest Apple may exceed its initial target of 9 million units, potentially reaching over 15 million. The deal could help Samsung make up for its loss of foldable OLED market share last year that dropped to around 40% and reach 70% in 2025 as demand for the technology soars and competition dwindles, analysts say.

The FTC is seeking to force Meta to restructure or sell Instagram and WhatsApp, testing President Donald Trump's promises to take on Big Tech while posing an existential threat to a company that by some estimates earns about half of its U.S. advertising revenue from Instagram.

Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) CEOTim Cookpreviously explained the company’s decision to continue manufacturing its products in China, refuting the widespread belief that it’s due to low labor costs. What Happened: A 2024 video of Tim Cook has resurfaced, providing insights into Apple’s manufacturing choices amid the ongoing U.S.-China tariff war. In the video, posted on X by CNBC TV18 reporter Nigel D’Souza, Cook dismissed the idea that Apple’s manufacturing in China is due to low labor costs, stating, “China stopped being a low labor cost company many years ago.” Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. Instead, he emphasized China’s unparalleled skilled labor concentration in one location and advanced tooling capabilities as the primary reason. Cook emphasized that “the products that we do require truly advanced tooling.”  On that note, Cook emphasized the sharp difference in vocational skills between the US and China. The Apple CEO stated, \"In the US, you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I’m not we could fill the room.\" In China, however, \"you could fill multiple football fields.... Hence, the vocational expertise in China is very deep”. Why It Matters: The U.S.-China tariff war has put pressure on American companies to shift production back home. Earlier this month, a leading tech analyst predicted asignificant price hikefor Apple iPhones if manufacturing shifts to the U.S., potentially reaching around $3,500. This is due to the complexity of recreating the production ecosystem that currently exists in Asia.

Furthermore, experts opined that Apple’s supply chain could face major disruptions due to new reciprocal tariffs. Apple had temporarily dodged steep tariffs on Chinese-made electronics following an exemption granted by Trump. A recent report also suggested that Apple completed an urgent logistics operation, transporting five planeloads of iPhones and other products from manufacturing centers in India and China to the U.S. within 72 hours, in a bid to beat PresidentDonald Trump's new 10% reciprocal tariff on imports. Given these complexities, Cook’s emphasis on China’s skilled labor and advanced tooling capabilities provides a clearer understanding of Apple’s manufacturing decisions.

Key Points To the relief of anyone with an aging iPhone, the Trump administration exempted smartphones, computers, and other tech products from its punishing tariffs on Chinese imports over the weekend. WhileApple(AAPL-0.19%)has geographically diversified its supply chain, the company still relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing partners for its devices. Absent any special treatment, prices in the U.S. on Apple products would have likely risen substantially due to the tariffs. While Apple is getting a big break, the relief may be short lived. President Trump later clarified that electronics like Apple's iPhones would be moving into a different tariff \"bucket.\" While Apple's devices may not be subject to the full tariff on Chinese imports, they may eventually be subject to some level of tariffs. Even if Apple somehow manages to avoid tariffs on its own products, the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, along with the uncertainty created by the Trump administration's generaltariff policy, could hurt the company in another way. While predicting anything about the economy right now is tough, the odds of an economic downturn certainly appear to be rising as businesses and consumers cope with the impact of unpredictable and ever-changing tariffs. Consumer confidence plunged in March, according to The Conference Board, and consumers' short-term expectations regarding economic conditions reached their lowest level in 12 years. These drops were recorded before the Trump administration announced its reciprocal tariffs, which led to a sharp stock market plunge. Smartphones are an essential item for nearly everyone, but purchases can also be easily deferred. The replacement cycles for smartphones and other electronic devices have been lengthening already, and this effect could go into overdrive during a recession. If smartphones also become more expensive due to tariffs, the replacement cycle could lengthen further. Apple Intelligence, Apple's take onAI-powered featuresfor its devices, probably won't save the day and induce many iPhone users to upgrade. Apple is reportedly having all sorts of problems with a revamped version of Siri, which raises questions about when the promised AI features will arrive and how useful they will be. New hardware probably won't help, either. The smartphone market is mature, and annual upgrades don't introduce much more than slightly better performance or other modest improvements. Without a good reason to upgrade, it won't be much of a sacrifice for consumers to kick the can down the road during a recession. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is800%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500. They just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now… *Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025 Despite iPhone sales flatlining and the tariff uncertainty, Apple stock trades for around 28 times the average analyst estimate for fiscal 2025. Analysts are still assuming, by the way, that Apple will manage to grow earnings significantly this year. That forecast could turn out to be overly optimistic depending on how the tariff situation plays out. I'm not convinced Apple stock deserves that kind of valuation, given all the headwinds facing the company. The iPhone business was already struggling to grow, and an economic slowdown isn't going to help matters. Even if Apple manages to stay out of the tariff crosshairs, sales and profits look likely to take a hit this year. Given the risks, Apple stock looks too expensive.

PfizerPFE announced that it is discontinuing the development of danuglipron, its investigational oral GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), which is being developed to treat obesity. The decision follows a safety signal observed during two dose-optimization studies, in which one study participant experienced a case of potential drug-induced liver injury. Although the individual was asymptomatic and fully recovered after stopping the treatment, Pfizer stated that its decision was based on a comprehensive review of all clinical data generated to date, along with recent regulatory feedback. While the two dose-optimization studies had met key pharmacokinetic goals and identified a dose with the potential for competitive efficacy and tolerability, the safety concerns ultimately led Pfizer to stop further development of danuglipron. This is the second time that Pfizer has faced setbacks in connection with the pipeline development of danuglipron. In December 2023, the company announced that it would not move forward with phase III studies on the twice-daily formulation of danuglipron. Though the drug was effective in reducing weight in a phase IIb study, it caused several gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Back then, the company said that the pharmacokinetic study of the once-daily formulation of danuglipron continues, and it will focus on its development. This also marks the second time in two years that Pfizer has given up on an obesity drug. Back in 2023, Pfizer had dropped the development of another GLP-1-RA candidate, lotiglipron, due to elevated levels of a type of liver enzymes seen in a study. Following these setbacks, Pfizer has decided to focus on developing its other obesity candidates, which are either in early-stage or mid-stage development. One such candidate is PF-07976016, an investigational GIP receptor being evaluated in a mid-stage study for obesity. Year to date, shares of Pfizer have lost nearly 17% compared with the industry’s 7% decline. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Post Pfizer’s announcement, shares ofEli LillyLLY andNovo NordiskNVO rose 3% and 2%, respectively, on Monday. Both companies dominate the diabetes and obesity market on the back of the tremendous success of their GLP-1 products. Lilly markets its dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, tirzepatide, as Mounjaro for type II diabetes and as Zepbound for obesity. Novo markets its semaglutide drugs as Ozempic pre-filled pen and Rybelsus oral tablet for type II diabetes and as Wegovy injection for weight management. The obesity market has garnered much interest lately. Per a research conducted by Goldman Sachs, the obesity market in the United States is expected to reach $100 billion by 2030. This is also evident from the fact that LLY and NVO have not only optimized their production capacities but are also developing multiple other novel obesity candidates at a rapid pace. The implication of Pfizer’s setback is clear for both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk — the immediate removal of a potential rival from the highly lucrative GLP-1 market. The latest setback puts Pfizer back at least a couple of years from entering the obesity space. A company that benefited from Pfizer’s announcement wasViking TherapeuticsVKTX, which jumped nearly 11% on Monday. VKTX is currently developing its obesity drug candidate VK2735 in both oral and subcutaneous (SC) formulations. Viking Therapeutics is one of the few companies in this space that has made rapid and encouraging progress with its obesity drug. Last month, Viking announced that it has completed enrollment in a mid-stage study evaluating oral VK2735, just a couple of months after the study initiation was announced in January. This swift enrollment underscores the growing interest in VK2735 and reflects the rising momentum in the weight-loss drug market, led by the success of Lilly’s Zepbound and Novo’s Wegovy. A late-stage study on the SC version is expected to start before the end of this quarter. Pfizer Inc. price | Pfizer Inc. Quote Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(VKTX) : Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com). Zacks Investment Research Shares of Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) and Structure Therapeutics (GPCR) are on the rise on Monday after Pfizer (PFE) announced its decision to discontinue development of danuglipron, an oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, which was being investigated for chronic weight management. While Morgan Stanley predicts “limited reaction” in Pfizer’s shares following the news, JPMorgan tells investors that the decision is “mostly a positive” for Structure and Viking, both developing drugs in the On Monday, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) said it had become aware of several hundred units of Ozempic (semaglutide) injection 1 mg distributed outside the Novo Nordisk authorized supply chain in the U.S. The seized counterfeit products feature lot number PAR0362 and illegitimate serial numbers beginning with the first eight digits 51746517. Lot number PAR0362 is an authentic lot number. Only when the lot number is coupled with the eight digits 51746517 it is counterfeit and should not be used. Als Pfizer  is halting development of its experimental weight-loss pill, as the booming obesity drug market remains out of reach for the drug giant.  The company said Monday the stoppage comes after it reviewed clinical data and a study subject developed a liver injury that might have been caused by the drug, called danuglipron.  Halting the drug’s development means  Pfizer  still is unable to get a cut, for now, of the white-hot obesity market, which analysts say could reach $100 billion by the end of the decade. In the most recent trading session, Eli Lilly (LLY) closed at $757.18, indicating a +0.38% shift from the previous trading day.

BofA analyst Tim Anderson notes Pfizer (PFE) announced danuglipron, an oral GLP-1 obesity, is being discontinued, following a case of liver injury seen in the phase 1 study. The firm points out that it has argued that this program has received almost too much attention – not because obesity isn’t important, but because this was only phase 1 data. Without danuglipron, Pfizer’s obesity pipeline now consists of a GIP receptor antagonist in phase 2 and a phase 1 oral GLP-1 in T2D with Nxera Pharma. If the company is committed to obesity, a possible next step could be business development, BofA argues. The firm reiterates a Neutral rating for Pfizer as it believes core thesis remains unchanged.

The company’s volatile nature of the trading business is a major headwind. Despite an impressive performance since 2022, it is expected to normalize going forward. This is likely to hamper fee income growth.The Zacks analyst project non-interest income to rise only 3.4% in 2025. Continued investments in the franchise will keep the company’s expenses elevated. We expect total non-interest expenses to rise 3% this year. While high funding costs are still a woe, the company’s net interest income (NII) will be positively impacted by higher rates for longer.The Zacks analyst expects NII to record a CAGR of 5.3% over the next three years. Plans to open financial centers in new and existing markets and improve digital capabilities will aid the top line. We project total revenues to grow 4.8% in 2025.(You canread the full research report on Bank of America here >>>)Chevron’sshares have declined -6.2% over the past six months against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry’s decline of -11.9%. The company being a fully integrated energy firm, is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin.Further, the planned acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana. However, the company is grappling with high sensitivity to oil fluctuations and relatively expensive valuation.Another concern is the weak margins on refined products that forced its downstream segment to its first quarterly loss in 4 years. Considering these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.(You canread the full research report on Chevron here >>>)Shares ofStrykerhave gained +4.3% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Products industry’s gain of +5.5%.

Pricing improvements and a strong hospital order book support 2025 growth.However, foreign exchange volatility and acquisition-related margin pressures may impact earnings.

Portfolio gains doubled to $3.6 million, bolstering earnings. Strong branding and diversified offerings serve both retail and institutional clients, supporting market position.However, core publishing revenue declined to $26.7 million, and customer concentration (30% from one client) heightens risk.

This microcap company with market capitalization of $36.37 million benefits from an extended long-term supply agreement with a global OEM, securing stable revenues as a sole-source supplier of Ultra Axle Shafts.Sypris Solutions’ diversified presence across automotive, energy, and industrial markets reduces risk and positions it to capitalize on growth trends in heavy-duty vehicles and energy infrastructure. Sypris Solutions is also aligned with growth in aerospace and defense electronics, leveraging its capabilities in high-precision components to meet rising demand. Expansion into the Asia-Pacific region aligns with high-growth markets, leveraging regional investments in defense and infrastructure.However, liquidity challenges constrain financial flexibility.

Key Points Pfizer(PFE1.51%)recently reminded investors how risky the drug-development business can be. On April 14, the company told investors it would scrap development of danuglipron, its oral GLP-1 candidate for weight management. The stock has been trading about 63% below its all-time high. Pfizer's stock price is way down, but the quarterly dividend it pays has risen for 16 consecutive years. At its beaten-down price, the stock offers an eye-popping 7.8% yield. If Pfizer continues its dividend-raising streak, investors who buy at recent prices could realize market-beating gains over the long run. Let's look a little closer at danuglipron, plus some bigger problems the company faces, to see if this stock could be a smart buy on the dip. The end of Pfizer's danuglipron program highlights just how risky the drug-development process can be. According to the company, it discontinued development after just one patient in a dose-optimization study experienced a liver injury that could have been caused by the experimental GLP-1 pill. The danuglipron program's termination is disappointing, but it won't be the end of Pfizer's attempt to developblockbusterweight-management drugs. The company has an oral glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) antagonist in phase 2 trials. Investors will probably hear more about this candidate, tentatively named PF-07976016, down the road. A disappointing outcome for a weight-management candidate isn't anywhere near the top of Pfizer's list of problems. Investors should be far more concerned with an upcoming loss of patent-protected market exclusivity for Eliquis. Sales of the oral blood thinner it markets in partnership withBristol-Myers Squibbrose to $7.4 billion, or 11.6% of total revenue last year. Eliquis is expected to lose patent-protected exclusivity in 2026, although generic competition in the U.S. market isn't expected to begin until 2028. Pfizer's second-largest revenue stream in 2024 could also start drying up soon. The Prevnar family of vaccines was responsible for over 10% of total sales last year. Prevnar 13 is expected to lose patent-protected exclusivity in the U.S. next year. Vyndaqel has been a strong growth driver for Pfizer but probably not for much longer. This treatment prevents heart damage caused by transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis and grew sales by 64% to reach $5.4 billion last year.Bridge BioandAlnylamare now marketing competing treatments for the limited population of TTR amyloidosis patients with heart damage. In addition to competing treatments, Vyndaqel is expected to face generic competition in the U.S. in 2028. Drug developers need to communicate with regulators at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before, during, and after they run clinical trials for new drug candidates. In the U.S., many of those regulators recently lost their jobs. In 2024, the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approved 50 new drugs. The CDER director, Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., stepped down in January and joined Pfizer's C-suite as chief medical officer. Having the former CDER director on staff could be advantageous for Pfizer, but I'll be pleasantly surprised if the FDA completes new drug approvals at half the usual pace this year. According to reporting from STAT, more than a few FDA employees involved in the new drug approval process were among thousands recently fired from the agency. A crippled FDA could be a huge problem for Pfizer and its peers who must constantly launch new drugs to overcome exclusivity losses for established products. Many investors expect pharmaceutical industry lobbyists to prevent the Trump administration from rendering CDER incapable of reviewing new drug applications at its usual pace. They could be right, but I won't support an investment thesis that relies on industry lobbyists protecting a regulatory agency. If you asked me a month ago, I would have called this stock a buy. In 2023, it earned FDA approval for nine new drugs and last year it reported over a dozen product approvals from the agency. With plenty of new products coming online, Pfizer had a good chance to overcome upcoming patent cliffs and maintain its dividend-raising streak. Now that the CDER has been dramatically downsized, it's probably best to assume the worst. I'll be avoiding this and all drugmaker stocks until we see proof that a much smaller FDA can continue approving new drugs at the usual pace.

We recently published a list ofBiotech Stocks Dominate Monday’s Top 10 Gainers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) stands against other biotech stocks that dominate Monday’s top gainers. The stock market kicked off the shortened trading week on a positive note, with Wall Street’s major indices finishing in the green following President Donald Trump’s temporary tax reprieve on technology companies. The S&P 500 recorded the highest gain, up 0.79 percent, while the Dow Jones came second at 0.78 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was also up by 0.64 percent. Benchmark indices aside, 10 companies dominated by biotechnology firms mirrored the broader market optimism, recording modest gains during the session. In this article, let us explore Monday’s top 10 gainers and the reasons behind their gains. To come up with the list, we only considered the stocks with $2 billion market capitalization and $5 million trading volume. A microbiologist in protective gear studying samples in a laboratory. Viking Therapeutics Inc. saw its share prices jump by 10.58 percent on Monday to finish at $24.57 apiece following news that Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) will discontinue the development of its oral obesity medication, danuglipron, amid safety concerns. According to PFE, the decision came after a patient experienced a potential liver injury linked to the drug. The scrapped plans, however, spelled good news for VKTX which is similarly underway with the development of an oral weight loss candidate called VK2735, with PFE now out of the competition. In other news, reports surfaced last month that PFE was set to take over VKTX, and tapped Morgan Stanley as its advisor for the acquisition. The rumors came days after VKTX released its earnings performance in the fourth quarter of the year, widening its net loss by 44 percent to $35.4 million from the $24.6 million in the same period a year earlier. Net loss for full-year 2024 also widened by 28 percent to $109.96 million from $85.895 million in 2023. Overall, VKTXranks 5thon our list of biotech stocks that dominate Monday’s top gainers. While we acknowledge the potential of VKTX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Shares of Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) and Structure Therapeutics (GPCR) are on the rise on Monday after Pfizer (PFE) announced its decision to discontinue development of danuglipron, an oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, which was being investigated for chronic weight management.

Pfizer (PFE) isending a late-stage trialof its once-daily GLP-1 pill, Danuglipron, after a participant experienced a liver injury. Yahoo Finance Senior ReporterAnjalee Khemlanijoins Market Domination Overtime to break down the details, as well as preview what to watch as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) prepares to report earnings. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtimehere. Pfizer announcing today that it is halting a late stage trial of its GLP-1 pill candidate. And Yahoo! Finance's very own Angelina Kamlani joins us now with the latest, Ange. Josh, that's right. We heard from Pfizer today that it is choosing to halt its phase three trial of danuglipron, that is its once daily oral pill that was supposed to be a really good competitor in the market. They said that they stopped it because one of the clinical trial participants had a liver injury and after getting off the pill was able to recover. So that is where things stand. This is, you know, really a bumpy ride for Pfizer and the end to it essentially for this one molecule. We'll have to see what the company decides to do. If you take a look at the stock, though, it didn't really move much on the news today, Wall Street seemed to kind of shrug it off, and it seems that analysts are looking at maybe the company looking inwardly through its pipeline or externally to acquire something to get it into the obesity space. Uh we got Akash Tewari from Jefferies saying that we're removing danuglipron from our model and lowering the price target for Pfizer as a result from $34 to $32, and we view this as another frustrating hit to management's credibility. The company has really been under the watch of investors for some time, and you can see on your screen the struggle that it had to really enter this obesity space already, ending one candidate earlier on in June 23rd because of similar liver issues, and then looking at twice daily danuglipron having to scrap that, then advancing once daily and now scrapping that as well. That leaves Eli Lilly as the only contender in the marketplace, uh, for a pill, as well as, of course, already a market leader with the injectables. So, really hot obesity space that Pfizer is missing out on, and investors are looking at what it can do to really get the next blockbuster out of its pipeline. I guess we'll have to wait till earnings at the end of the month to hear more about that. Ange, healthcare is such a big business, but if you get it right, you make a lot of money. Johnson & Johnson reports earnings tomorrow. Any wisdom, what to expect? Yeah, we're definitely keeping an eye on a few things for Johnson & Johnson. Of course, it is a maker of medical devices, which we know have been hit by the tariffs as well as a pharmaceutical manufacturing, which has been, uh, looked at as having some sort of special tariffs that we've heard from President Trump. So, we're looking on any kind of impact from those conversations, as well as broader tariff impact on guidance. We've seen a couple of companies pull, and we'll see if Johnson & Johnson does so as well. We do know the company has committed to $55 billion in US manufacturing. So we'll have to see how that all shakes out when the company, uh, lets us know tomorrow morning. Ange, thank you. Appreciate it. Pfizer is ending the development of its potential once-daily pill treatment for obesity before venturing into the biggest and most expensive level of clinical testing.  The drugmaker said Tuesday that it would stop studying danuglipron after a participant in one of its trials experienced a possible drug-induced liver injury that ended once the person stopped taking the treatment.  The once-daily version of the pill was in early-stage testing, with researchers trying to figure out the best dose for patients, a spokeswoman said. Johnson & Johnson is holding its earnings outlook steady despite President Donald Trump signaling he could put tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry. The administration announced earlier it would conduct an investigation into drug imports. That move is widely seen as a first step toward imposing new levies. Earnings and revenue both beat estimates for the quarter. Johnson & Johnson CFO Joe Wolk joined Bloomberg Open Interest to talk about how tariffs could hit the industry and the drug maker's bottom line. Pfizer still has another obesity pill in development, PF-07976016, which is currently in a Phase IIa trial. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Bank of America Corporation (BAC), Chevron Corporation (CVX) and Stryker Corporation (SYK), as well as two micro-cap stocks Value Line, Inc. (VALU) and Sypris Solutions, Inc. (SYPR). While cigarette consumption has been in long-term decline, Altria has successfully pivoted to smoke-free alternatives. Pfizer ends its most advanced clinical trial of an obesity pill to compete in the hot GLP-1 space. Pfizer  is halting development of its experimental weight-loss pill, as the booming obesity drug market remains out of reach for the drug giant.  The company said Monday the stoppage comes after it reviewed clinical data and a study subject developed a liver injury that might have been caused by the drug, called danuglipron.  Halting the drug’s development means  Pfizer  still is unable to get a cut, for now, of the white-hot obesity market, which analysts say could reach $100 billion by the end of the decade.

Pfizerrecently announced the cessation of Danuglipron's development, an event that coincided with a 3% decline in its share price over the past week. This move was primarily due to safety concerns in clinical studies. Despite achieving key pharmacokinetic goals, the discovery of a potential drug-induced liver injury prompted Pfizer to reassess its strategy. This decision adds weight to the company's stock performance, contrasting with broader market trends, where major indexes experienced upward movement amidst tariff-related developments and positive gains in tech sectors. Pfizer's decision highlights the importance of rigorous safety evaluations in pharmaceutical developments. We've discovered 3 warning signs for Pfizer (2 are significant!) that you should be aware of before investing here. Explore 22 top quantum computing companies leading the revolution in next-gen technology and shaping the future with breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, superconducting qubits, and cutting-edge research. The cessation of Danuglipron’s development could significantly influence Pfizer's revenue and earnings forecasts moving forward. By prioritizing rigorous safety measures, Pfizer may face setbacks in accelerating R&D productivity and the associated revenue streams. This shift may lead to a more conservative approach in pipeline-driven growth expectations and could delay anticipated financial impacts from new products, potentially further pressuring revenue forecasts already impacted by legislative changes. The development halt aligns with observed market volatility around Pfizer shares, shedding light on investor concerns regarding the company's future earning capabilities amidst evolving challenges in the pharmaceutical sector. Over the past year, Pfizer's total return, including dividends, was a 10.14% decline, signaling underperformance relative to both the broader market and the US Pharmaceuticals industry, which experienced negative returns of 8.6%. During this period, the company's earnings showed considerable growth from a very low base, yet they have not matched market expectations overall. Notably, analysts have set a fair value price target of US$26.02, suggesting upside potential compared to the current share price of US$22.49. However, this assumes improvements in profit margins and financial performance that are not without risk given current operational challenges and headwinds from pricing reforms in Medicare.

The company said Monday the stoppage comes after it reviewed clinical data and a study subject developed a liver injury that might have been caused by the drug, called danuglipron.

DANUGLIPRON DISCONTINUATION:Pfizer announced the decision to discontinue development of danuglipron, an oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, which was being investigated for chronic weight management. Pfizer’s dose-optimization studies of once-daily formulations of danuglipron met key pharmacokinetic objectives and confirmed a formulation and dose with the potential to deliver a competitive efficacy and tolerability profile in Phase 3 testing, based on earlier studies of twice-daily danuglipron. While the overall frequency of liver enzyme elevations across the over 1,400 participant safety database of danuglipron is in-line with approved agents in the class, a single asymptomatic participant in one of the dose-optimization studies experienced potential drug-induced liver injury which resolved after discontinuation of danuglipron. After a review of the totality of information, including all clinical data generated to date for danuglipron and recent input from regulators, Pfizer has decided to discontinue development of the molecule. “Cardiovascular and metabolic diseases including obesity remain important areas of unmet medical need, and we plan to continue applying our global capabilities to advance a pipeline of investigational treatments that have the potential to fill critical gaps in patient care, including continued development of our oral GIPR antagonist candidate and other earlier obesity programs,” said Chris Boshoff, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Research and Development at Pfizer. “While we are disappointed to discontinue the development of danuglipron, we remain committed to evaluating and advancing promising programs in an effort to bring innovative new medicines to patients.” LIMITED REACTION:Commenting on the news, Morgan Stanley says that its sense is that investor expectations for Danu were low. With Pfizer shares trading at a greater than 7% dividend yield, which could offer support for the stock, the firm expects “a limited reaction” in the shares to the discontinuation news. Morgan Stanley keeps an Equal Weight rating and $31 price target on Pfizer shares. The firm also notes that it expects initial Phase 3 data for Eli Lilly’s Orforglipron this quarter representing the next key catalyst for the oral GLP-1 category. MOSTLY POSITIVE:JPMorgan says Pfizer’s decision to discontinue development of danuglipron, an oral small molecule GLP-1, due to a liver toxicity issue in one patient, is “mostly a positive” for Structure Therapeutics and Viking Therapeutics. Structure is now in line to become the second small molecule oral to enter the market and Viking becomes an “even more attractive partnership candidate,” the firm tells investors in a research note. JPMorgan believes Structure shares could be modestly up, to 5%, as a result of Pfizer’s update. PRICE ACTION:In Monday morning trading, shares of Pfizer are up modestly at $22.17, while Viking’s shares have jumped about 10% to $24.43 and Structure has rallied almost 11% to $17.77.

Key Points On Tuesday, investors continued to snap up shares of big pharmaceutical companyPfizer(PFE1.51%). Somewhat counterintuitively, this week's rise came after the company announced it was ending the development of a drug in a very hot product category. On Tuesday, Pfizer's stock closed the day 1.5% higher, providing a pleasant contrast to theS&P 500index's 0.2% dip. Tuesday was a relatively uneventful news day for Pfizer, especially following thepharmaceuticalgiant's disclosure on Monday that it halted the development of its investigational weight loss drugdanuglipron. This occurred after a patient suffered a liver injury during the testing of the medication. Yet Pfizer watchers are well aware that the large and well-resourced company doesn't only have one pony in the race. It has a different treatment in its pipeline, PF-07976016, that's based on a different mechanism and is currently undergoing phase 2 clinical trials. One analyst tracking the pharmaceutical stock didn't hesitate to point in a new research note published Tuesday morning that the company still has options. Bernstein SocGen's Courtney Breen wrote in her analysis, according to reports, that Pfizer will likely turn to its tried-and-true strategy of building up its pipeline with mergers and acquisitions, and/or licensing of products developed by peers. Investors can be quite a hardy bunch, and collectively they seem to be shrugging off what many would consider a major setback in the lab with danuglipron. That being said, it is a setback, and Pfizer hasn't been a pharmaceutical pace-setter since the days of its Comirnaty vaccine during the coronavirus pandemic. The market is likely to start getting more impatient with the company soon.

Obesity stocks likeNovo NordiskNVO,Eli LillyLLY,Structure TherapeuticsGPCR andViking TherapeuticsVKTX gained 2.1%, 3%, 10.6% and 19.2%, respectively, on Monday after pharma bigwigPfizerPFE announced that it is discontinuing the development of its GLP-1R weight loss pill, danuglipron. Pfizer has decided to discontinue the development of its oral obesity drug danuglipron, despite promising results from dose-optimization studies that met key pharmacokinetic goals and showed potential for competitive efficacy and tolerability. Although liver enzyme elevations in the enrolled patients were generally consistent with other approved drugs in the same class, one patient experienced a potential case of drug-induced liver injury, which resolved after stopping treatment with danuglipron. After reviewing all clinical data and considering regulatory feedback, Pfizer concluded that halting the program was the best course of action. This decision reverted Pfizer’s developmental program for an obesity candidate back to the early clinical stages and has significantly delayed its hopes for marketing an obesity drug that would compete with Lilly’s Zepbound and Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy for market share. However, PFE shares have not slid despite the setback, which likely reflects positive investor expectations regarding Pfizer’s ability to bounce back from its current predicament. Pfizer plans to continue the development of its oral GIPR antagonist candidate, PF-07976016, which is currently in mid-stage development and other early-stage obesity programs. Pfizer could also in-license rights to a late-stage obesity candidate from other biotechs for developing and commercialization. Interestingly, Jefferies reduced Pfizer’s price target from $34 to $32 following the setback, but maintained its BUY rating for the stock. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly currently dominate the obesity market on the back of the tremendous success of their GLP-1 injections. Lilly markets its dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, tirzepatide, as Zepbound for obesity, while Novo Nordisk markets its semaglutide drug as Wegovy injection for weight management. Year to date, shares of PFE, LLY and NVO have lost 16.6%, 2.3% and 23.2%, respectively, compared with the industry’s 4.9% decline. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Pfizer’s setback eliminates an imminent contender for LLY and NVO’s market share in the obesity space. Both firms have been raking in substantial revenues from the sale of their respective obesity injections. In 2024, Zepbound sales amounted to $4.9 billion, while Wegovy sales recorded $8.4 billion during the same time frame, both representing a substantial increase over their previous year's figures. Shares of Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Viking Therapeutics and Structure Therapeutics rose as Pfizer's decision to discontinue its obesity pill program removes a key competitor from the market. Lilly and Novo Nordisk are also developing oral pills for treating obesity. Oral drugs are easier to use compared to injections, which can improve patient compliance. NVO is developing its oral obesity pill, amycretin, in a mid-stage study while Lilly’s oral obesity pill, orforglipron, is currently undergoing phase III development. Viking Therapeutics and Structure Therapeutics also have oral obesity candidates in their pipeline in mid-stage development. Year to date, shares of VKTX and GPCR have plunged 38.9% and 30.1%, respectively, compared with the industry’s 6.4% decline. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research VKTX is currently evaluating the safety and efficacy of the oral formulation of its experimental obesity drug, VK2735, in a mid-stage study. Last month, the company reported completing enrollment in the phase II VENTURE-Oral Dosing study of the candidate for the obesity indication. Data from this study is expected in the second half of 2025. VKTX also plans to start a late-stage study on the subcutaneous version of VK2735 by the first half of this year. On the other hand, Structure Therapeutics is conducting multiple mid-stage studies on its lead candidate, aleniglipron(GSBR-1290), a highly selective oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, for treating healthy overweight or obese individuals. The rapid advancements being made by Viking Therapeutics and Structure Therapeutics in the development of their respective oral obesity treatment candidates have made them lucrative targets for collaboration or M&A deals.

The Secret Formula for Faster Trains Even Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem NYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six Lisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City’s Housing Shortage President Donald Trump’s administration pressed forward with plans to impose tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports by initiating trade probes led by the Commerce Department. The moves, announced Monday in the Federal Register, are a precursor to imposing tariffs and threaten to broaden the president’s sweeping US trade war. The Commerce Department said it had begun investigating the impact on US national security of “imports of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment” as well as “pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, including finished drug products” in a pair of register notices. Listen to the Here’s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. The probes, which began April 1 and were ordered under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, could play out for months. Under the law, the Commerce Secretary is expected to deliver the results of his investigation within 270 days, though Trump and other officials have signaled these efforts could conclude more quickly. The US president has long decried foreign production of drugs and chips as a threat to national security and threatened to slap tariffs on imports in a bid to revive American manufacturing of those products. But the duties could also wreak havoc on supply chains and drive up costs for Americans. New levies threaten to roil a chips industry that notched more than $600 billion in global sales of semiconductors essential to products ranging from cars to airplanes and mobile phones to consumer electronics. Supply chains still feeling the effect of disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic now could face new strains from the US duties. The administration’s announcement came days after it exempted semiconductors, mobile phones, computers and other electronics imports from 145% duties applied to China. That announcement was seen as a boon to tech giants like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., but Trump and his advisers quickly said the relief would be short lived and that separate levies would be placed on chips. The Commerce Department investigation on semiconductors is designed to have a wide range, evaluating imports of both legacy and leading-edge chips that are coveted for artificial intelligence applications. The probe will span imports of all semiconductors and the equipment used to manufacture them as well as electronic products that contain the components, according to the government notice. Tariffs on the semiconductor sector risk affecting a wide range of companies that send billions of dollars in microprocessors and related goods to the US each year. Foreign makers of advanced chips including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and SK Hynix of South Korea could be forced to raise prices or accept smaller margins if Trump delivers on his threat of import levies. The measures also threaten to impose higher costs on Trump’s vision for expanding domestic semiconductor production, especially if imported chip-manufacturing equipment from companies like ASML Holding NV gets hit with tariffs. Netherlands-based ASML is a leading provider of advanced lithography machines used to produce the smallest computer chips used in AI and other sensitive applications. The separate drug probe will examine imports of all pharmaceuticals — both finished generic and non-generic medicines — as well as the ingredients used to make them. Investigators also will probe imports of critical pharmaceutical inputs. The public is invited to weigh in on both probes with comments over the next 21 days. Tariffs would also be a blow to the world’s largest drugmakers, including Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly & Co., virtually all of which operate scores of manufacturing sites scattered across the globe. Alex Schriver, spokesman for the trade group PhRMA, said in a statement that the pharmaceutical industry shares Trump’s goal of boosting US manufacturing. While he said the industry would work with the administration throughout its process, he added that “medicines have historically been excluded from tariffs because they can lead to higher costs and shortages of life-saving medicines.” Drug companies have raced to announce major investments in the US ahead of potential tariffs. Most recently, Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG said it plans to invest $23 billion in the US over the next five years, following earlier pledges from Eli Lilly, Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson. But experts warned that likely wouldn’t blunt the impact of the tariffs. “There is no quick fix for exposed companies, in our view,” Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a note to clients ahead of the announcement. “Redomiciling manufacturing would take years and be very costly.” Drugmakers will face a choice between eating the costs of potential tariffs or raising prices for their medicines in what is already the most expensive market in the world. “There’s a lot at stake politically I think for branded manufacturers to be increasing prices here,” said Marta Wosińska, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center on Health Policy. “I do think there’s going to be reluctance to passing through price increases.” Because there are some controls on the price of drugs, tariffs could end up hurting drugmakers’ bottom line, leading them to scale back research, according to Lilly Chief Executive Officer Dave Ricks. “We have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade offs within our own companies,” Ricks recently told the BBC. “Typically that will be in reduction of staff or research and development (R&D) and I predict R&D will come first. That’s a disappointing outcome.” Trump, who has repeatedly bemoaned US drugmakers’ reliance on overseas production, is breaking decades of tradition. The pharmaceutical industry has long side-stepped trade wars, protected by international agreements that largely protected medicines from tariffs on humanitarian grounds. Worldwide Impact Trump’s move on semiconductors is similar to the way he’s targeted other sectors, with imported steel, aluminum and automobiles already facing 25% tariffs and an ongoing Commerce Department trade probe expected to result in levies on foreign copper. Under former President Joe Biden, the US already had doubled tariffs on so-called legacy semiconductors from China to 50% and last December launched a probe into Chinese concentration in the category that sets the stage for Trump to impose even higher levies. While not as advanced as chips driving artificial intelligence, the older technology is ubiquitous in autos, airplanes, medical devices and telecommunications. Trump has cast revitalizing the US chipmaking industry and industrial base as essential for the nation’s security. Winning a global race to dominate the AI industry is also a top Trump administration priority. Analysts have warned that bringing chip manufacturing to the US will take years of hard work. The move on medicines will have an outsize effect on Ireland, with a $54 billion (€47.6 billion) trade surplus with the US that helped spur Trump’s wrath. The imbalance, heavily weighted by the pharmaceutical industry, stems from the country’s favorable tax regime and highly educated workforce. US drug companies, including Lilly and Pfizer Inc., operate nearly two dozen factories in Ireland that ship to the US, according to a TD Cowen analysis. The US biotech industry, which drives much of the innovation in drug development, is also vulnerable to the new tariffs. Nearly 90% of American companies rely on imported components for US-approved products, according to a recent survey by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. As a result, the supply of medicines for US patients and families are particularly vulnerable to proposed tariffs on the European Union, China and Canada, the group wrote. Nearly all of the companies surveyed said they expect manufacturing costs to surge if import tariffs are placed on the European Union. Half of the 42 companies said they’d be forced to scramble for new research and manufacturing partners or they’d need to rework or potentially delay regulatory filings for new products. “Re-onshoring key parts of the biotechnology supply chain to the U.S. and our allies and strengthening the American manufacturing base should be a high priority for both national and economic security,” BIO President John Crowley said in a statement. “It will take years, though, for this shift. We need to be mindful of the negative consequences of these proposed tariffs.” Trump’s Exemptions The US president earlier Monday announced he would consider temporary reprieves from his 25% tariff on automotive imports to allow companies time to bring production to the US. The announcement suggested that the president was willing to negotiate with industry leaders, and a similar push from technology and pharmaceutical executives is almost certain to follow. “He’s going to get this onshoring to happen as soon as possible and as orderly as possible,” Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Monday on Fox Business. “And so when he talks to CEOs and they say, ‘Hey, I need a little more time with this, I need a little time more more time with that,’ then he’s absolutely willing to listen.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, said the administration remained focused on negotiating deals that would benefit Americans. “I think we’re going to start the negotiations, and just like with everyone else, I’m telling them, bring your A-game. We’ll see what you got, and we’ll go from there,” Bessent said. Trump was asked what short-lived product exclusions he was considering but did not specify how long a potential pause or lowering of auto levies would remain in place. --With assistance from Michael Shepard, Annmarie Hordern, Hadriana Lowenkron and Derek Wallbank.

The firm points out that it has argued that this program has received almost too much attention – not because obesity isn’t important, but because this was only phase 1 data. Without danuglipron, Pfizer’s obesity pipeline now consists of a GIP receptor antagonist in phase 2 and a phase 1 oral GLP-1 in T2D with Nxera Pharma.

Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) justpulledthe plug on its daily weight-loss pill, danuglipron, after a clinical trial flagged a potential drug-related liver injury. That decision comes after earlier setbacks tied to severe nausea in its twice-daily versionand leaves Pfizer even further behind in a weight-loss market expected to hit $130 billion by 2030. With demand for Covid products fading fast, the company had pinned big hopes on obesity drugs to fill the gap. Instead, it's now heading back to the drawing board. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with PFE. The market didn't take the news lightly. Pfizer shares dropped around 1% premarket 8.59am, while rivals popped. Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) jumped 2.75%, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) rose 2.27% , and Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX) soared nearly 20% in the premarket trading at the same timeall riding momentum from stronger weight-loss offerings. Lilly's Zepbound, a once-weekly injectable, is already generating nearly $5 billion a year and has an oral version in the final stretch of trials. Structure Therapeutics and AstraZeneca aren't far behind, with their own oral contenders in the pipeline. This misstep throws more heat on Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who's under pressure to offset looming patent cliffs that could wipe out $15 billion in revenue by decade's end. So far, the pipeline hasn't delivered, and the M&A spree hasn't produced a clear winner. As competitors rack up approvals and market share, Pfizer may have to rethink its next moveand fast. Investors will be watching closely to see if another round of strategic acquisitions is in the cards. This article first appeared onGuruFocus. Pfizer (PFE) announced Monday that it is ending development of its daily weight-loss pill following a liver injury to a patient participating in a trial. Pfizer  is halting development of its experimental weight-loss pill, as the booming obesity drug market remains out of reach for the drug giant.  The company said Monday the stoppage comes after it reviewed clinical data and a study subject developed a liver injury that might have been caused by the drug, called danuglipron.  Halting the drug’s development means  Pfizer  still is unable to get a cut, for now, of the white-hot obesity market, which analysts say could reach $100 billion by the end of the decade. Signs of potential liver damage in a study participant led the company to abandon danuglipron, a drug it hoped would help it break into the highly lucrative market for obesity drugs. The drugmaker said one patient became ill after being treated with its experimental weight-loss drug, danuglipron. Pfizer said it will stop development of an oral weight-loss pill after a participant taking the drug in a clinical trial experienced a \"liver injury.\" Pfizer bows, but is not entirely out of the GLP-1 race.

We recently published a list of10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar. On Thursday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer cautioned viewers about what may lie ahead once the 90-day pause on new tariffs comes to an end. While discussing the latest Consumer Price Index report, Cramer acknowledged that the numbers looked favorable, with inflation appearing relatively tame and even some categories experiencing actual price declines. He pointed to energy prices, saying, “The best, anything it touched energy, which is plummeting.” READ ALSO:Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocksand10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently. “This is essentially an embargo. President Trump’s ecstatic that the tariffs are already taking in $2 billion a day. He’s thrilled that supposedly 75 countries are begging for something more reasonable than the 90-day pause when the 90-day pause comes to an end.” According to Cramer, President Trump is “ecstatic” that these tariffs are already generating $2 billion a day in revenue and is thrilled about 75 countries “supposedly” asking for something more workable once the 90-day grace period concludes. Despite the seemingly positive revenue flow, Cramer expressed concern over the broader consequences. He pointed out that many Americans have yet to grasp the full impact of trade policies that have allowed foreign businesses to flood U.S. markets with inexpensive products, often pricing out domestic companies. While many consumers embraced the lower costs, Cramer reminded his audience that it came at the expense of American jobs. “Now we’re going to have to pay a price. He stressed that consumers should be prepared to pay significantly more for a wide range of goods. He said that the additional cost largely will likely benefit foreign companies, which will hike prices in response to the tariffs imposed on them. He clarified his position by stating he is not a staunch advocate of free trade for its own sake. “No other country plays by the rules on trade, so we shouldn’t either,” he said but cautioned: “We just have to be more thoughtful about this or we’ll end up doing more harm than good. Again, as someone who wants fair trade, not free trade, I am rooting for the president to pull this off, but not at the expense of great American companies that have done nothing wrong and are the best in the world.” For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A medical technician wearing protective gloves and a mask mixing a biopharmaceutical solution. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92 A caller asked if Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was a buy or not and Cramer remarked: “Well, let me tell you something… right now, we have a government that is trying to figure out whether it’s going to tax the heck out of drug companies, raise tariffs outta drug companies or not. I can’t make a prediction anymore. It yields 8%. Normally I say fine, but you know what? Let’s say you decide, you know what, we need big tariffs on Pfizer. You’ll say, wow, I’m buying that stock at 18 rather than 21. So I’m going to have to say, pass.” Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) focuses on discovering, creating, manufacturing, and supplying biopharmaceutical products. Its work covers areas such as heart health, infectious illness, cancer treatment, immune system conditions, and vaccines. On March 31, Cramer said: “Is Pfizer dead money? I mean I think it’s been mummified. I don’t know. I mean it’s like, wow. Look at that thing. Close the casket… Alright, Pfizer is unfortunately dead money. Dr. Bourla’s a terrific guy… what can I say? He’s a terrific guy. He’s a terrific guy.” Overall, PFEranks 1ston our list of stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar. While we acknowledge the potential of PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

      "content": "Pfizer still has another obesity pill in development, PF-07976016, which is currently in a Phase IIa trial. Pfizer has terminated the development of its oral obesity candidate danuglipron after a patient on a clinical trial with the drug suffered a liver injury. The oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) was being investigated in chronic weight management in several Phase I andPhase II trials. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Two Phase I studies (NCT06567327 and NCT06568731) met pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints and determined a formulation and dose for danuglipron. In one of these studies, an asymptomatic patient experienced a potential drug-induced liver injury. The injury resolved after drug discontinuation; however, Pfizer has decided, based on this event, available clinical data, and recent input from regulators to discontinue the development of the drug. The therapy has been investigated in a total of 1,400 patients. Ensuring the integrity of pharmaceutical products is one of the most complex challenges in global healthcare today. From temperature-sensitive biologics to advanced cell and gene therapies (CGTs), the pharmaceutical supply chain must be carefully managed to maintain compliance, ensure efficacy,… Chief scientific officer and president of R&D at Pfizer, Dr. Chris Boshoff said: “While we are disappointed to discontinue the development of danuglipron, we remain committed to evaluating and advancing promising programs in an effort to bring innovative new medicines to patients.” Pfizer will be presenting data from the studies at an upcoming medical conference and peer-reviewed journal. Unlike some of its big pharma competitors, Pfizer has not had much luck in the obesity pill space. In December 2023, the company stopped the development of the twice-daily version of danuglipron due tohigh rates of gastrointestinal side effects. This came six months after the company hadculled another oral GLP-1-RA candidate, lotiglipron, due to associated high transaminase levels. The company still has another oral obesity candidate in trials, a once daily glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor antagonist, PF-07976016. The therapy is being investigated in a Phase IIa trial (NCT06717425), which was initiated in December 2024. Pfizer faces fierce competition in the obesity space, especially from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, both of which have cemented a reputation with their subcutaneous GLP-1RA therapies Wegovy (semaglutide) and Zepbound (tirzepatide), respectively. A new survey from GlobalData aims to gain insights into deploying new technology in clinical research. Eli Lilly is also looking to enter the oral obesity space and is running a Phase III programme of its daily pill orforglipron. GlobalData predicts sales of orforglipron to reach $11.8bn in 2030. GlobalDatais the parent company ofClinical Trials Arena. Biotechs are also making headway in the obesity arena. Viking Therapeutics is studying an oral version of the weight loss therapy VK2735 in an ongoing Phase II study (NCT06828055), and its subcutaneous formulation is set to enter a Phase III trial in Q2 2025. Pfizer’s stock, listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), remains stable despite the danuglipron announcement. Meanwhile, Viking’s stock, listed on the Nasdaq exchange, jumped by 21% at market open today (14 April). Meticulous planning is central to building an effective clinical trial, powered by well-designed Interactive Response Technology (IRT) which provides not only the expected randomization and trial supply management (RTSM) but additional study management solutions.

We recently published a list of the10 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) stands against other best value dividend stocks. Dividends, though sometimes underappreciated, have significantly contributed to long-term investor gains. Between 1960 and the end of the previous year, reinvested dividends and the effects of compounding accounted for about 85% of the S&P Index’s total return. Dividend-oriented strategies offer the advantage of steady income, improved portfolio stability, and a potential buffer during uncertain economic periods—making them a strong choice for all-weather portfolios. With ongoing tariff tensions in the US adding to market volatility, many investors have begun favoring dividend-focused approaches to strengthen their portfolios. After a stretch where growth stocks took center stage, dividend investing has started to regain traction. According to a report by Franklin Templeton, US-listed dividend ETFs recorded average monthly net inflows of nearly $3.3 billion during the six months leading up to January 31, 2025—up sharply from just $107 million during the same period a year earlier. Given the uncertain global environment, investors have increasingly leaned toward more reliable components to maintain portfolio balance. Dividend-paying stocks—particularly those backed by strong fundamentals—have emerged as a preferred option due to their ability to generate stable and predictable cash flows. Since these cash flows play a central role in equity valuation models, determining the intrinsic value of dividend stocks typically involves less uncertainty compared to valuing growth-oriented equities. As a result, such stocks are seen as a stabilizing force within a diversified investment strategy. According to analysts, the strength of dividend-paying stocks lies in their capacity to cushion portfolio losses during market downturns while still providing a meaningful upside. Historically, dividend strategies have shown defensive qualities across different regions and time periods. Data for the three-year span ending December 31, 2024, revealed that dividend stocks experienced lower volatility and smaller maximum drawdowns than the broader market in global, US, and European segments. Notably, when concerns over inflation and rising interest rates resurfaced in August, dividend stocks proved more resilient than their growth-focused counterparts. Historically, income-focused investing often leans heavily toward value stocks, as investors typically look for companies offering high dividend yields and lower valuation multiples. However, a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices points out that the Dividend Aristocrats Index strikes a balance between both value and growth characteristics. Since 1999, the index has maintained an average composition of roughly 60.5% value stocks and 39.5% growth stocks, showing no consistent bias toward either investing style. Analysts maintained that a portfolio combining strong dividend yield, consistent dividend growth, and resilience in payouts should always remain relevant. They noted that even without relying on market revaluation, the combination of income and income growth could support projected nominal gross returns exceeding 10% annually.

For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 proprietary database of billionaires’ stock holdings and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked dividend stocks with forward P/E ratios below 20, as of April 13. The stocks are ranked according to the number of billionaires having stakes in them. Where two or more stocks were tied on billionaire sentiment, we used forward P/Es as a tiebreaker between them. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Billionaire Holders: 17 Forward P/E Ratio as of April 13: 17.42 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is a Minnesota-based multinational conglomerate that operates in a wide range of industries. The stock is outperforming the broader market this year, surging by nearly 5% since the start of 2025. In the past 12 months, MMM has delivered a nearly 49% return to shareholders. The rise signals growing investor confidence in CEO Bill Brown’s strategy to steer the company back on track. Several challenges are already showing signs of progress, and where that’s not yet the case, Brown has set plans in motion. For instance, the healthcare division was spun off into a new company called Solventum last year. In addition, 3M has reached settlements related to PFAS and combat earplugs, providing both management and shareholders with greater clarity regarding future financial obligations. In the fourth quarter of 2024, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) reported revenue topping $6 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts by $157 million. The firm has recently focused on reinforcing its core business segments, with innovation continuing to play a central role. Investments in exclusive technologies and patents have helped sharpen its competitive advantage. Meanwhile, steps to boost efficiency—particularly within the supply chain—have led to a 70% improvement in suppliers meeting delivery timelines. The company’s ability to manage regulatory issues and ongoing legal matters has also contributed to its financial resilience and investor trust. With a forward P/E ratio of 17.42, MMM is one of the best value stocks to monitor. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) also maintained a healthy cash flow throughout FY24, generating $1.8 billion from operations and $4.9 billion in free cash. During the year, it returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through a mix of dividends and stock buybacks. Notably, on February 4, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 4.3% to $0.73 per share—the first increase since halving the payout in May of the previous year. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.15%, as of April 13. Overall, MMMranks 6thon our list of the best value dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of MMM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Key Points Oil prices have tumbled this year. WTI, the primary U.S. oil price benchmark, has plunged from about $80 a barrel in early January to around $60 a barrel. The culprit has been the concern that tariffs will slow the global economy, driving down demand for crude oil. Lower crude prices will impact oil company cash flows. However, someoil stocksarein a better positionto navigate the lower oil prices than others due to theirabundantlow-cost oil resources. Three oil companies that can still thrive in the current environment areDevon Energy(DVN-0.77%),ConocoPhillips(COP-0.84%), andChevron(CVX-0.59%). Devon Energy has a premier multibasin U.S. onshore resource portfolio. The company produces oil and gas from the Rockies, Delaware Basin, Anadarko Basin, and Eagle Ford. That diversification helps reduce risk and enhances its long-term growth profile. The Delaware Basin, which runs through west Texas and southeast New Mexico, is the crown jewel of Devon Energy's portfolio. The company gets 56% of its production from that world-class oil resource. That position will fuel the oil company for years to come. Devon has thousands of remaining drilling locations with an average breakeven level of $40 per barrel. Because of that, it can still make a lot of money drilling in the region at the current oil price point. The company's low-cost resources position it to produce a lot of cash even in the current environment. Devon was on track to make over $3 billion in free cash flow this year when WTI was above $70 a barrel during the first quarter. While that number will decline if crude remains around $60, Devon will still produce a lot of excess cash this year. It plans to return about 70% of that money to shareholders via its dividend and share repurchases, retaining the rest to strengthen its already rock-solid balance sheet. ConocoPhillips has a global portfolio of low-cost resources. The company held about 20 billionbarrels of oil equivalentresources with a supply cost below $40 a barrel for WTI. It added even more low-cost resources last year when it acquired Marathon Oil. That deal topped off its tank by adding more than 2 billion barrels of resources with an averagecost of supplybelow $30 per barrel for WTI. The company's low-cost resources position it to produce a lot of cash in the current environment. ConocoPhillips initially expected to generate enough excess free cash flow this year to return $10 billion to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. While lower oil prices will impact the amount of excess free cash flow it produces this year, itcould still achieve that capital return target thanks to its cash-rich balance sheet. ConocoPhillips ended last year with $6.4 billion of cash and short-term investments and another $1 billion of long-term investments. Meanwhile, it'sworking toward generating an additional $2 billion in cash via non-core asset sales. Chevron has a globally integrated energy business. That integration between upstream (oil and gas production) and downstream (refining and chemicals) helps mute some of theimpactof lower oil prices. The company also has a very low-cost global resource portfolio. The energy giant has stress-tested its business for lower oil prices. Chevron forecasts that it can produce enough cash flow from operations to cover its high-yielding dividend (currently over 5%) and capital spending program at $50 oil through 2027 with room to spare. Meanwhile, the company has the balance sheet capacity to buy back shares at the low end of its $10 billion-$20 billion annual target range during that period at that price point. Chevron is working to further enhance its low-cost resource portfolio by acquiringHess. The deal would add a world-class position in offshore Guyana and other high-quality assets to diversify and enhance Chevron's portfolio. It would further bolster the company's low-cost supplies, putting it in an even stronger position to thrive duringperiods oflower oil prices. The recent downdraft in crude prices will impact the cash flows that oil companies produce. However, Devon Energy, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron haveverylow-cost operations and strong balance sheets. Because of that, they can still thrive at lower prices by producing lots of cash that they can return to investors through dividends and share repurchases. That makes them lower-risk ways to invest in the oil patch.

Chicago, IL – April 15, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Bank of America Corporation BAC, Chevron Corporation CVX and Stryker Corporation SYK, as well as two micro-cap stocks Value Line, Inc. VALU and Sypris Solutions, Inc. SYPR. The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Bank of America Corporation, Chevron Corporation and Stryker Corporation, as well as two micro-cap stocks Value Line, Inc. and Sypris Solutions, Inc.The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You cansee all of today’s research reports here >>> Shares ofBank of Americahave gained +2.5% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry’s gain of +20.4%. The company’s volatile nature of the trading business is a major headwind. Despite an impressive performance since 2022, it is expected to normalize going forward. This is likely to hamper fee income growth. The Zacks analyst project non-interest income to rise only 3.4% in 2025. Continued investments in the franchise will keep the company’s expenses elevated. We expect total non-interest expenses to rise 3% this year. While high funding costs are still a woe, the company’s net interest income (NII) will be positively impacted by higher rates for longer. The Zacks analyst expects NII to record a CAGR of 5.3% over the next three years. Plans to open financial centers in new and existing markets and improve digital capabilities will aid the top line. We project total revenues to grow 4.8% in 2025. (You canread the full research report on Bank of America here >>>) Chevron’sshares have declined -6.2% over the past six months against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry’s decline of -11.9%. The company being a fully integrated energy firm, is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin. Further, the planned acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana. However, the company is grappling with high sensitivity to oil fluctuations and relatively expensive valuation. Another concern is the weak margins on refined products that forced its downstream segment to its first quarterly loss in 4 years. Considering these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point. (You canread the full research report on Chevron here >>>) Shares ofStrykerhave gained +4.3% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Products industry’s gain of +5.5%. The company is poised for growth, driven by rising demand for robotic-assisted procedures, hospital capital expenditures and international expansion. The Mako SmartRobotics platform fuels adoption, while acquisitions like Inari Medical and Vertos Medical enhance the portfolio. Stryker is actively integrating new technologies such as AI-driven imaging and smart surgical systems to improve patient outcomes and maintain its competitive edge. Pricing improvements and a strong hospital order book support 2025 growth. However, foreign exchange volatility and acquisition-related margin pressures may impact earnings. Supply chain disruptions and rising costs could strain profitability. Intensifying competition in robotics and MedTech demands constant innovation. Macroeconomic risks, including potential downturns in healthcare spending and regulatory shifts, add uncertainty. (You canread the full research report on Stryker here >>>) Value Line’sshares have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry over the past year (+10% vs. +6.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $370.23 million have robust cash generation, with cash balances rising to $27.1 million from $6.1 million YoY, enhances liquidity and supports dividends, buybacks, and growth investments. EAM Trust income surged 47.7% to $13.8 million, driven by AUM growth to $5 billion, providing a rising, diversified passive income stream. The company maintains disciplined capital returns, paying $0.90/share in dividends and repurchasing shares, with $0.9 million authorization remaining. Portfolio gains doubled to $3.6 million, bolstering earnings. Strong branding and diversified offerings serve both retail and institutional clients, supporting market position. However, core publishing revenue declined to $26.7 million, and customer concentration (30% from one client) heightens risk. Operating costs and taxes rose, further pressuring margins, while limited international presence (~2% of revenues) increases vulnerability to U.S. market shifts. (You canread the full research report on Value Line here >>>) Shares ofSypris Solutionshave gained +3.6% over the past year against the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry’s gain of +36.3%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $36.37 million benefits from an extended long-term supply agreement with a global OEM, securing stable revenues as a sole-source supplier of Ultra Axle Shafts. Sypris Solutions’ diversified presence across automotive, energy, and industrial markets reduces risk and positions it to capitalize on growth trends in heavy-duty vehicles and energy infrastructure. Sypris Solutions is also aligned with growth in aerospace and defense electronics, leveraging its capabilities in high-precision components to meet rising demand. Expansion into the Asia-Pacific region aligns with high-growth markets, leveraging regional investments in defense and infrastructure. However, liquidity challenges constrain financial flexibility. Rising costs and reliance on cyclical markets such as heavy vehicles and oil and gas exacerbate margin sensitivity. Competitive pressures in aerospace further heighten vulnerability.

We recently published a list of the11 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other undervalued energy stocks. On March 18, Tortoise Capital senior portfolio manager Rob Thummel appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ to discuss his outlook on the energy sector. He believes that natural gas is positioned to lead growth in the future within the energy sector. This natural gas demand is driven by electricity and energy exports. Thummel noted that the energy and tech sectors are converging due to advancements like AI and data centers. Electricity demand fuels natural gas consumption, while US energy exports help meet global needs for low-cost and low-carbon energy. He also highlighted that the US is now emerging as the largest exporter of LNG, even though it was an LNG importer just years ago. He anticipates that the US LNG exports will soon 2x in volume over time. Thummel also expects Europe and other countries to prioritize energy security and diversify their supply sources. This will ensure reliance on US energy exports. Thummel emphasized a focus on energy infrastructure companies while discussing his specific investment strategies as they tend to be stable and have high dividend yields even in uncertain market conditions. He thinks that the certainty provided by energy infrastructure investments in an otherwise volatile market should not be neglected. Such companies generate substantial annual cash flows while maintaining disciplined financial practices. Thummel thinks that the energy sector trades at a discount to historical valuations despite its fundamentals. This offers the potential for high returns. We used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top energy stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15 as of April 10. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Forward P/E Ratio as of April 10: 12.92 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81 Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) engages in integrated energy and chemicals operations and operates in the Upstream and Downstream segments. The Upstream segment explores, develops, and produces crude oil and natural gas. The Downstream segment refines crude oil into petroleum products, markets crude oil, refined products, & lubricants, and manufactures & markets renewable fuels. In 2024, the company’s Permian Basin operations exceeded expectations with production growth of about 18% compared to the year-ago period, which was another record for Permian production. Over the past 5 years, the company has delivered a CAGR of 16% in the Permian, which has been achieved through optimized pad and drilling designs, as well as completion improvements such as triple frac techniques. This allows the company to reach these production levels with 40% fewer company-operated rigs than previously planned. Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) now expects Permian production to reach one million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025. The Permian portfolio delivers superior returns due to royalty-advantaged acreage across all sub-basins, which contributes to both the top and bottom lines. Overall, CVXranks 3rdon our list of the best undervalued energy stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of CVX, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Key Points Warren Buffett is famous because of the long-term success he has achieved runningBerkshire Hathaway. But there are two interesting things about this company. First, it is run kind of like a mutual fund. Second, it doesn't pay dividends despite the fact that Buffett often invests in dividend-paying companies. Here's why that matters and why you might want to buy one of these three dividend payers he owns. One of the core tenets ofBuffett's investment approachis to buy good companies when they are attractively priced. But the next step is to hold for the long term so he can benefit from the growth of the businesses he buys. One of the nuances that gets lost in this is that he uses the cash generated from the companies he owns outright or owns in Berkshire Hathaway's common stock portfolio to reinvest in his business. That allows him to compound those cash flows over time and this enhances the returns he generates for investors. Image source: The Motley Fool. From a big-picture perspective, you can do the same thing bydividend reinvesting. All it takes is a phone call to your broker, or, more likely, a button press on your broker's website or in its app. And in one quick and easy move you'll be investing more like Warren Buffett. But what if you want to invest even more like Oracle of Omaha? Well, three dividend-paying stocks he owns today areCoca-Cola(KO-0.76%),Chevron(CVX-0.59%), andKraft Heinz(KHC-1.26%). Here's a look at these three Buffett stocks to see if they'll be a good fit for your Buffett style dividend reinvesting. Coca-Cola is a very easy company to like. It is the industry-leading beverage company with a globally diversified business. It is large enough to have economies of scale in distribution, marketing, and research and development, and it can, and does, act as an industry consolidator. The dividend has been increased annually for over five decades, making ita Dividend King. The dividend yield is 2.9%, which is well above the market's yield today. For conservative dividend investors it is a solid choice. The only problem is that the stock looks a little expensive at the moment, with both the price-to-sales andprice-to-earningsratios above their five-year averages. However, if you are willing to pay a premium for income security, Coca-Cola could be a good fit for your portfolio. Another industry leader in Buffett's portfolio isenergygiant Chevron. It is one of the largest integrated energy companies you can buy, with a business that spans from the upstream (energy production) through the midstream (pipelines) and into the downstream (chemicals and refining). This diversification helps to soften the impact of the inherent swings in the commodity-driven energy sector. On top of that, the company has a very strong balance sheet, which allows it to take on leverage during industry downturns to support its business and dividend. The dividend, notably, has been increased annually for 38 years thanks largely to Chevron's solid business model. That said, energy price volatility still has a material impact on the stock price. Right now energy prices are weakening andthe dividend yieldis a very attractive 4.7%. The yield could go higher if oil prices continue to fall. But the history here suggests that the dividend will continue to get paid even if oil prices continue to fall. You could try to time your entry into Chevron, but the truth is it is a strong energy choice at just about any point of the energy cycle. The last big dividend stock on this list is Kraft Heinz. It is a toughconsumer staples stockto love when you compare it to Coca-Cola. Yes, Kraft Heinz's dividend yield is a lofty 5.3%, but the dividend has been static since it was cut in 2019. The big story is the business overhaul that's taking place. The company was created via the merger between Kraft and Heinz. The goal at that time was to cut costs to boost profitability. But cutting costs can only take a company so far before it needs to refocus on growth. That's what Kraft Heinz has been doing, after turning to a new management team. But the results haven't been particularly impressive, which is why the dividend has been stuck in neutral for so long. If you consider this high-yield food maker you'll need to go in understanding that it is aturnaroundstory that will require extra monitoring. It's probably only appropriate for more aggressive investors. While Buffett owns Coca-Cola, Chevron, and Kraft Heinz in his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, you don't actually need to own these specific stocks to benefit from dividend reinvestment. These are just three stocks to get you thinking about the real investment tool that's important here, which is the reinvestment of dividends so you can compound your returns over time -- just like Buffett does with his investments.

The latest monthly report from OPEC shows that the cartel has revised its global oil demand growth forecast for 2025 downward for the first time since December, now projecting an increase of 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) — 150,000 bpd less than previous estimates. The revision stems largely from slower-than-expected consumption and new U.S. tariffs that have rattled trade dynamics and economic sentiment globally. As President Trump ramps up tariff measures, including a 125% levy on Chinese imports, investors are growing increasingly wary about how this might dampen energy demand, particularly in emerging markets.Despite these geopolitical headwinds, oil prices remain relatively steady, with WTI crude hovering over $60 per barrel. However, volatility is high. Crude futures are down more than 10% so far this month, largely on fears that slowing global trade and rising supply will pressure prices. Against this backdrop, it may be wise for investors to adopt a more defensive approach—one that focuses on large, resilient players likeChevronCVX,ConocoPhillipsCOP, andEOG ResourcesEOG. These companies have the scale, balance sheets, and capital discipline to navigate turbulence, making them safer bets in uncertain times. OPEC’s cautious tone isn’t just based on oil-specific fundamentals. The group’s Monthly Oil Market Report also trimmed its global economic growth outlook for 2025 to 3.0%, from 3.1%, reflecting growing uncertainty in light of the ongoing trade tensions. The U.S. economy is forecasted to expand by 2.1% in 2025, while growth in the Eurozone and China is expected to slow to 0.8% and 4.6%, respectively. These projections imply weaker industrial activity and transport fuel demand—the key drivers of global oil consumption.OECD nations are forecast to contribute a mere 40,000 bpd to demand growth in 2025, while non-OECD countries, traditionally the growth engine, are expected to add around 1.25 million bpd. However, these numbers could fall if trade tensions and inflation continue to hurt energy use by consumers and businesses. On the supply front, OPEC’s report showed that the broader OPEC+ group reduced output slightly in March, with total production falling by 37,000 bpd to 41.02 million bpd. Cuts from Nigeria and Iraq offset gains from Kazakhstan, which continues to exceed its output cap. However, OPEC+ is scheduled to increase output again in May, raising questions about how the additional barrels will be absorbed in a softer demand environment.Meanwhile, non-OPEC supply growth has also been revised down. OPEC now expects non-OPEC+ liquids production to rise by 900,000 bpd in 2025—100,000 bpd less than previously forecast. Most of this increase is still expected to come from the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. However, with U.S. shale growth slowing and cost inflation a growing concern, the global supply outlook looks slightly more balanced than a month ago. The near-term outlook for oil is shaped by two opposing forces: weak demand growth weighed down by economic uncertainty and trade friction, versus constrained supply growth and OPEC+ discipline. While the trade war has clouded investor sentiment, the fundamentals don’t suggest a collapse. Air travel demand remains solid, road mobility is recovering, and oil use is still expected to grow, albeit at a slower pace.Moreover, OPEC’s view remains more optimistic than other forecasters. While Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have cut their demand forecasts sharply, OPEC still sees long-term demand trending higher, unlike the Paris-headquartered International Energy Agency (IEA), which anticipates a peak within the decade.For investors, the takeaway is clear: volatility is here to stay. But energy is still a vital part of the global economy, and demand isn’t going away—it’s just shifting. That’s why it’s smart to stick with strong, stable companies that generate solid cash flow. With tariffs roiling markets and macro uncertainty clouding short-term outlooks, it’s prudent to hold on to proven, cash-generating energy stocks. Companies like Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and EOG Resources offer resilience and upside potential once the market regains clarity.OPEC’s latest report may signal a slower pace of demand growth, but it also confirms that oil is still very much a necessary commodity. In times like these, investors should stay patient, avoid chasing volatility, and lean on the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) names best equipped to ride out the storm.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Chevron:Chevron is well-run and historically a profitable big oil giant. Chevron’s upstream portfolio remains a key strength, with strong production growth from the Permian Basin and Kazakhstan. The company is targeting a 6% annual production increase through 2026, with high-margin projects driving long-term value. Chevron continues to be a strong dividend player, having increased its payout for 37 consecutive years. The latest dividend hike of 4.9% takes its yield to over 4%, making it a reliable income source for long-term investors.ConocoPhillips:Based on production and reserves, ConocoPhillips is among the leading upstream energy players in the United States. In 2024, COP produced a record 1,987 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day globally, thanks to its strong presence in the prolific low-cost resources in the U.S. Lower 48 and Alaska, along with Asia, Australia, Africa, Europe and Canada. ConocoPhillips, with a debt-to-capitalization of 27.3%, is also demonstrating its strong financials and is well-positioned to navigate the tariff-induced market uncertainty.EOG Resources:In the United States, EOG is among the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. As of year-end 2024, the firm reported total net proved developed reserves of 2,566 million barrels of oil equivalent. Despite the decline in oil prices, EOG’s operations in low-cost resources like the Delaware Basin, a sub-basin of the broader Permian and Eagle Ford shale play, are still profitable. EOG Resources also has a strong balance sheet that the upstream player can rely on to ride the current uncertain business environment. Notably, EOG Resources’ low debt-to-capitalization of 13.9% is considerably below the industry’s 51.4%. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Monday, April 14, 2025The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Bank of America Corporation (BAC), Chevron Corporation (CVX) and Stryker Corporation (SYK), as well as two micro-cap stocks Value Line, Inc.

The company’s volatile nature of the trading business is a major headwind. Despite an impressive performance since 2022, it is expected to normalize going forward. This is likely to hamper fee income growth.The Zacks analyst project non-interest income to rise only 3.4% in 2025. Continued investments in the franchise will keep the company’s expenses elevated. We expect total non-interest expenses to rise 3% this year. While high funding costs are still a woe, the company’s net interest income (NII) will be positively impacted by higher rates for longer.The Zacks analyst expects NII to record a CAGR of 5.3% over the next three years. Plans to open financial centers in new and existing markets and improve digital capabilities will aid the top line. We project total revenues to grow 4.8% in 2025.(You canread the full research report on Bank of America here >>>)Chevron’sshares have declined -6.2% over the past six months against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry’s decline of -11.9%. The company being a fully integrated energy firm, is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin.Further, the planned acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana. However, the company is grappling with high sensitivity to oil fluctuations and relatively expensive valuation.Another concern is the weak margins on refined products that forced its downstream segment to its first quarterly loss in 4 years. Considering these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.(You canread the full research report on Chevron here >>>)Shares ofStrykerhave gained +4.3% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Products industry’s gain of +5.5%.

Pricing improvements and a strong hospital order book support 2025 growth.However, foreign exchange volatility and acquisition-related margin pressures may impact earnings. Supply chain disruptions and rising costs could strain profitability. Intensifying competition in robotics and MedTech demands constant innovation. Macroeconomic risks, including potential downturns in healthcare spending and regulatory shifts, add uncertainty.(You canread the full research report on Stryker here >>>)Value Line’sshares have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry over the past year (+10% vs. +6.4%).

Portfolio gains doubled to $3.6 million, bolstering earnings. Strong branding and diversified offerings serve both retail and institutional clients, supporting market position.However, core publishing revenue declined to $26.7 million, and customer concentration (30% from one client) heightens risk. Operating costs and taxes rose, further pressuring margins, while limited international presence (~2% of revenues) increases vulnerability to U.S. market shifts.(You canread the full research report on Value Line here >>>)Shares ofSypris Solutionshave gained +3.6% over the past year against the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry’s gain of +36.3%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $36.37 million benefits from an extended long-term supply agreement with a global OEM, securing stable revenues as a sole-source supplier of Ultra Axle Shafts.Sypris Solutions’ diversified presence across automotive, energy, and industrial markets reduces risk and positions it to capitalize on growth trends in heavy-duty vehicles and energy infrastructure. Sypris Solutions is also aligned with growth in aerospace and defense electronics, leveraging its capabilities in high-precision components to meet rising demand. Expansion into the Asia-Pacific region aligns with high-growth markets, leveraging regional investments in defense and infrastructure.However, liquidity challenges constrain financial flexibility. Rising costs and reliance on cyclical markets such as heavy vehicles and oil and gas exacerbate margin sensitivity. Competitive pressures in aerospace further heighten vulnerability.(You canread the full research report on Sypris Solutions here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Pfizer Inc.

Key Points March 2025 might seem like ages ago in market years, as the Trump tariffs have rocked the market like few things before it. However, the trends in March are not so different from what's happening now, as consumer sentiment was rapidly weakening and fears of a recession were mounting before thetariffannouncement. Let's take a look at the two best-performingDow Jones Industrial Average(^DJI-0.38%)companies to see if they're worth buying today. Image source: Getty Images. UnitedHealth Group(UNH-0.59%)is one of the most resilient stocks on the market. Healthcare is considered a recession-proof industry, but health insurance is even more unaffected by the economy because people need coverage regardless. It's not a surprise, then, that investors have piled into the stock in March and have continued to do so through the tariff-related chaos of April. There was no major company-specific news out on UnitedHealth in March, and investors seem to be returning to the stock after it tumbled following the assassination of one of its executives in December 2024. UnitedHealth has been one of the rare winners on the stock market in April, gaining 15% thanks to a 5.06% increase in Medicare Advantage benchmarks and its reputation as a port in a storm during turbulent market times. Chevron(CVX-0.59%)might seem like a surprise on this list as the energy sector is typically highly sensitive to the economic cycle. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is800%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500. They just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now… *Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025 The source of Chevron's gains was a surprising one, as Reuters reported that the company was angling for a piece of the data center market, developing the sites and supplying the electricity for facilities. Data center demand is surging along with AI, and the energy to power it is at a premium. However, while that was a smart strategic move, it wasn't enough to keep the stock climbing in April as it fell sharply after tariffs were announced. Chevron will continue to be sensitive to the health of the global economy and oil prices.

OPEC and its allies have revised their oil demand projectionsdownward for both 2025 and 2026, citing mounting global trade tensions and tariffs as key risks to economic growth. The group now expects global crude demand to rise by 1.3 million barrels per day over the next two years roughly 150,000 barrels per day lower than previous forecasts. OPEC+ also adjusted its global GDP growth outlook, trimming expectations to 3% for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026, each down by 0.1 percentage point. The global economy showed a steady growth trend at the beginning of the year, the organization said in its monthly oil market report. However, recent trade-related dynamics have introduced higher uncertainty to the short-term global economic growth outlook. Among the factors behind the downgrade, OPEC+ pointed to U.S. President Donald Trump's newly imposed 145% tariffs on China the world's largest crude oil importer as a significant headwind for energy demand. Despite the lowered outlook, the oil-producing bloc has agreed to ramp up output starting in May. Analysts warn this move could flood the market with excess supply at a time when consumption is weakening. Since the tariff announcement on April 2, oil prices have fallen sharply. Brent crude is currently trading around $64.68 per barrel, down 13% since the start of the month and off another 1% on April 14. Major oil producers have not been spared. Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Shell (NYSE:SHEL), and BP (NYSE:BP) have all seen their shares drop over 10% in the past month. This article first appeared onGuruFocus. Initial data shows high-quality reservoirs and a potentially commercial volume of hydrocarbons, the company said. CVX's Venezuelan oil shipments halted by PDVSA amid payment uncertainty due to U.S. sanctions derails its plans to export oil. Zertus has expanded its share from 50% to full ownership of Well Plus Trade. LONDON (Reuters) -OPEC cut its 2025 global oil demand growth forecast on Monday for the first time since December, citing the impact of data received for the first quarter and trade tariffs announced by the United States.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, in a monthly report, said world oil demand would rise by 1.30 million barrels per day in 2025 and by 1.28 million bpd in 2026.  Both forecasts are down 150,000 bpd from last month's figures. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reduced its oil-demand outlook for this year and next, citing the impact of U.S. tariffs. Let's take a look at the two best-performing Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) companies to see if they're worth buying today.  UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) is one of the most resilient stocks on the market.

We recently published a list of the10 Best Oil Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other best oil stocks. After an encouraging start to the year, the energy sector is once again lagging behind the overall market. At the time of writing this piece, the broader energy sector has slid by almost 8.2% since the beginning of 2025, against declines of around 7.9% by the wider market. The principal reason behind this fall is the decline in the global prices of oil, which have plunged by almost 14.5% since the beginning of the year. READ NEXT:10 Best Clean Energy Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires The continued uncertainty surrounding the ongoing tariff war and the recent decision by OPEC+ to increase supply in May have taken a toll on the global price, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price now hovering around a 3-year low of $61.5. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecasted WTI price to average $63.88 per barrel for 2025 before dropping to an average of $57.48 next year. Such a sharp decline in prices could threaten US oil production growth this year. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the US oil industry needs prices between $61 and $70 per barrel to be profitable. The escalating trade tensions between the US and China have also raised the prospect of a global economic slowdown, potentially leading to a lower-than-forecasted consumption of oil. In its latest report, the EIA now expects global oil consumption to increase by 900,000 b/d in 2025 and 1 million b/d in 2026, down by 400,000 b/d and 100,000 b/d, respectively, from its initial forecast last month. The decrease in demand, coupled with increasing production, will continue putting pressure on crude prices, forcing many industry players to cut back activity to maintain investor payouts. The American oil and gas sector is also frustrated by the back and forth trade policies of President Trump and is questioning how they align with his ‘drill, baby, drill’ mandate to further boost production. According to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, nearly a third of oil executives have stated that their business outlook has worsened since the end of 2024. Moreover, the imposition of the 25% tariff on steel and aluminum has already led to an estimated 4% increase in costs for drilling a well. The pressing issues surrounding the global oil trade have forced the industry to shift focus to its second major source of revenue – natural gas. In contrast to oil, the benchmark US natural gas price at Henry Hub has surged by more than 123% since last year and by almost 18% since the beginning of 2025. The uptick comes as a result of slowing output in 2024, booming LNG exports, and fast-depleting inventories during the coldest winter in six years. Moreover, natural gas has emerged as a leading candidate to power the ongoing AI boom and its accompanying data centers, with many providers now even aiming to surpass utilities and supply directly to these power-hungry facilities. Also, despite the broad concerns, many billionaires continue to invest and remain bullish on the oil sector. A great example is how Warren Buffett’sBerkshire Hathawaymaintains significant holdings in multiple oil majors and even recently invested hundreds of millions of dollars in an oil and gas giant over the last few months.

Chevron Corporation’s CVX operations in Venezuela have hit a major roadblock as state-owned oil firm PDVSA abruptly canceled export authorizations for several of its vessels due to payment uncertainty amid the hardening of U.S. sanctions on the OPEC-member country. This move has left at least two tankers loaded with Venezuelan crude stranded at the port. In contrast, four others were forced to depart empty, indicating a significant intensification in the U.S.-Venezuela energy standoff. The turmoil follows the Trump administration’s recent decision to revoke Chevron’s license to operate in Venezuela. Although the license was set to expire with a wind-down period ending May 27, PDVSA has begun enforcing restrictions ahead of schedule. These actions have derailed the company’s plans to export oil, even for cargoes that were already loaded and awaiting departure. Two Chevron-chartered tankers, named Dubai Attraction and Carina Voyage, remained idle in Venezuelan waters, pending authorization to return their cargoes. These shipments had been formally declared to Venezuela’s customs authority, and now require new clearance to be unloaded or rerouted. Meanwhile, four other Chevron vessels — Pegasus Star, Ionic Anax, Calypso and Sea Jaguar — were denied loading access altogether. Carina Voyager was en route to Chevron's Pascagoula refinery in Mississippi, while Dubai Attraction was slated to transfer its cargo to the Valero Energy-chartered tanker, Cap Corpus Christi, near Aruba. However, the Cap Corpus Christi departed for the United States on Friday only partially loaded, as it was unable to complete the ship-to-ship transfer. The Venezuelan vice president placed the blame entirely on U.S. sanctions. In a Telegram post, the nation cited that Chevron, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), was not able to pay PDVSA due to the U.S.-driven economic war, thus prompting the return of crude shipments. The shipments are now being rerouted to other international markets, suggesting Venezuela’s intention to gain some alternative buyers. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Chevron’s joint ventures in Venezuela produce roughly 25% of the country’s total oil output, which reached an average of 250,000 barrels per day to the United States in early 2025. The sudden halt in its exports not only jeopardizes this flow but also threatens to deepen Venezuela’s economic and political isolation. U.S. sanctions had earlier stifled Venezuela’s crude trade with China due to the imposition of a 25% secondary tariff on any country that traded with the United States. However, Reuters reports indicate that shipments to China have resumed, although slowly and cautiously. The recent moves also affect other major energy companies. Licenses previously granted toShell plcSHEL andBP p.l.c.BP have also been revoked, disrupting planned offshore gas projects and a license for French oil firm Maurel & Prom to operate in Venezuela. European firms such asEni S.p.A.E andRepsol, S.A.REPYY are no longer allowed to receive oil from Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA in lieu of payments. The Trump administration’s broader objective appears to be pressuring president Nicolás Maduro by tightening control over Venezuela’s largest revenue source — its vast crude reserves. SHEL, a London-based oil supermajor and BP, an integrated energy company, had plans to send gas to Trinidad and Tobago through a natural gas project that operated offshore Venezuela. However, the U.S. sanctions gave a major blow to the plans of SHEL and BP. Both BP and SHEL have been hit hard by the withdrawal of the licenses for two gas fields in Venezuelan waters that they plan to develop with Trinidad and Tobago and its National Gas Company. In March 2024, REPYY and E also received a notification from the U.S. authorities regarding their revocation of oil licenses for operations in Venezuela. Repsol SA explores, develops and produces crude oil products and natural gas, and transports petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gas. Italy-based Eni SpA is among the leading integrated energy players in the world. The upstream operations include the exploitation and production of oil and natural gas resources.

Chicago, IL – April 14, 2025 – Zacks Value Trader is a podcast hosted weekly by Zacks Stock Strategist Tracey Ryniec. Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2445093/energy-stocks-take-a-dive-values-or-traps Welcome to Episode #401 of the Value Investor Podcast.  (0:15) - Can You Find Value In The Energy Industry or Are They Traps? (6:30) - Tracey Takes A Deep Dive Into 3 Stocks To Consider For Your Portfolio (32:20) - Episode Roundup: XOM, CVX, EOG Podcast@Zacks.com Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks. In April 2025, after the Liberation Day tariffs were put into place by the United States, crude oil plunged. WTI traded down to $56 a barrel and has been gyrating between $55 and $65 ever since. While lower oil prices can mean good news for consumers at the pump, it’s bad news for the energy producers who are unhedged and have certain breakeven levels. The oil and natural gas stocks have gotten hammered due to falling commodity prices and the uncertainty from the tariff turbulence of 2025. Although oil escaped direct American tariffs. Energy companies are lumped into different categories within the oil industry. In this podcast, Tracey talks about “Big Oil” which are the large, integrated oil companies and the American explorers and producers, or the “E & Ps.” The Integrated Oil stocks, as an industry, are down just 3.9% year-to-date. But the American E&Ps, as an industry, are now down 27.8% on the year. The E&Ps, which do not have refining, chemicals, or other divisions to offset their production, are much more volatile when oil sells off. Just because a stock sells-off and now has a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, doesn’t mean that it’s a true value in the classical sense of the word. Remember, a true value stock is cheap on a P/E basis, but also has rising earning estimates. Are the energy stocks cheap, or just traps? Exxon Mobil is a large American integrated oil company. Shares of Exxon are down 7.1% year-to-date but have finally started sinking in the last month, falling 10.6% in that time. Exxon appears cheap with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.1. The 2025 Zacks Consensus Estimate is looking for $7.13 but that’s 8.5% under the $7.79 Exxon made last year. One earnings estimate has been revised higher for 2025 and 2 lower in the last week. Exxon is a dividend all-star, with its dividend currently yielding 3.9%. Is Exxon Mobil a value or a trap in 2025? Chevron is also a large, American integrated oil company. Shares of Chevron are down 6.8% year-to-date but have been hit harder over the last month than Exxon. It’s down 14.3% during that time. But there have been dramatic one-day swings the last week. Chevron is cheap. It has a forward P/E of 13.3. The Zacks Consensus is looking for $10.30 in 2025, which is earnings growth of 2.5% as it made $10.05 in 2024. Chevron also pays an attractive dividend, yielding 4.8%. Is Chevron a value after the sell-off or a trap? EOG Resources is a large cap American exploration and production company. It produces in key basins including the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, and Dorado Play. EOG Resources has a strategy of returning at a minimum of 70% of annual free cash flow to shareholders. Shares of EOG Resources have fallen 14.7% year-to-date but have really taken it on the chin in the last month, declining 16.9%. It’s cheap, with a forward P/E of 9.5. A P/E under 10 is usually considered a dirt-cheap stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is looking for $11.09. EOG Resources made $11.62 last year so that is a decline of 4.6%. EOG Resources is currently paying a dividend yielding 3.5%. Is EOG Resources a value or a trap in 2025? Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.

We recently published a list ofJim Cramer’s Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. On Friday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer outlined what investors should focus on in the week, especially pointing to earnings reports from major banks. “Rumor, innuendo, intrigue these are the stuff of great novels, of fabulous miniseries, riveting plays, and now they’re the stuff of the stock market.” READ ALSO:Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocksand10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently. He noted the chaotic nature of the current environment and remarked that “this tape has it all,” and emphasized how unpredictable developments from the White House have added to the turbulence. Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes. “Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,” he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, “Except this isn’t an eight-part blockbuster, it’s our money.” Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday’s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic. Cramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a “liberation day bottom,” a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, “Not sure, I’m just not sure.” He added: “Have you ever noticed the weekends don’t provide relaxation anymore because the president’s got advisors? He’s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He’s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime…. Monday’s trading, well, let’s just say that it looks like that it’s earning season so it’s gonna be even harder than usual.” For this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a financial advisor giving advice to a customer, demonstrating the importance of consumer and wealth management. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) was mentioned during the episode, and here’s what he had to say: “Alright, well, let’s start with Goldman Sachs, right? That’s what it’s, it’s the first bank stock. It’s the first stock that reports this week and I’ve gotta tell you, usually doesn’t report on Mondays. It’s interesting. JPMorgan stole the show today with a monster good quarter. Wells Fargo was too run of the mill. That one hurt me for my Charitable Trust. I don’t know… Morgan Stanley, better. Goldman’s by far the most controversial. Why? Because as an investment bank, its business can be pretty episodic. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is a financial firm known for investment banking. It also provides wealth management services and other financial solutions. Overall, GSranks 1ston our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of GS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

As we recentlydiscussedin another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities. So, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.

As we recentlydiscussedin another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities. So, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last. Warren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’sBerkshirepicks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities. Overall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio. So, let’s take a look at the top Goldman Sachs value stocks.

(Bloomberg) — The US economy is set to lose billions of dollars in revenue in 2025 from a pullback in foreign tourism and boycotts of American products, adding to a growing list of headwinds keeping recession risk elevated. Arrivals of non-citizens to the US by plane dropped almost 10% in March from a year earlier, according to data published Monday by the International Trade Administration. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates in a worst-case scenario, the hit this year from reduced travel and boycotts could total 0.3% of gross domestic product, which would amount to almost $90 billion. Foreign tourism has been a tailwind for the US in recent years as the cessation of pandemic-era restrictions sparked a resurgence of international travel. But many potential visitors are now rethinking their vacation plans amid increased hostility at the border, rising geopolitical frictions and global economic uncertainty. One of them is Curtis Allen, a Canadian videographer who canceled an upcoming US vacation after President Donald Trump imposed punitive tariffs on his home country and suggested it should become the 51st US state. Allen and his partner have been on multiple camping trips to Oregon over the years, but this year, they will be traveling around British Columbia instead. “We’re not just staying home,” said Allen, 34. “We’re going to go spend the same money somewhere else.” Allen’s hesitance doesn’t stop there. He canceled his Netflix subscription and is actively avoiding American imports at the grocery store. “Now it takes us double the time, because we’re looking at where the products came from,” he said. International travelers spent a record $254 billion in the US last year, according to ITA figures. Coming into 2025, the outlook was positive: The ITA projected in early March that the US would welcome 77 million visitors this year, just shy of the 2019 record, before pushing to a new high in 2026. But those estimates came out just before stories of harsh detentions at US airports, ensnaring travelers from countries like France and Germany, started making headlines. Major public institutions in Canada, including a pension management firm and a leading hospital, are now advising staff against traveling to the US. Almost $20 billion in retail spending from international tourists in the US may be at risk, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis. Early signs of a sharp pullback are already showing up. Airfares, hotel rates and car rental costs fell in March, according to a monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics report on consumer prices published April 10. Economists at Goldman Sachs and HSBC Holdings Plc said lower demand, including from foreign travelers, probably played a role. Omair Sharif, president of Inflation Insights, noted the decline in hotel rates was driven by an almost 11% drop in the Northeast in particular, possibly a result of fewer Canadians traveling there. “Given what we know about how much Canadian travel has fallen off, that’s potentially a bit worrying for that region,” Sharif said. The timing is “very interesting” for Rainbow Air Helicopter Tours in Niagara Falls — which just invested $25 million in a new building, an enhanced fleet and a virtual reality attraction ahead of the busy summer season — said Patrick Keyes, the firm’s sales and marketing manager. “We are waiting to see the fallout,” he said. Canadian flight reservations to the US are down 70% through September versus the same period last year, according to a report by OAG Aviation Worldwide. Meanwhile US summer bookings are also down 25% among European tourists at Accor SA hotels — which Chief Executive Officer Sébastien Bazin said could be attributed to border detentions creating a “bad buzz” and diverting tourists to other destinations. “US tariff announcements and a more aggressive stance toward historical allies have hurt global opinions about the US,” Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Megan Peters said in a March 31 report. “This headwind provides another reason — in addition to the more direct negative impacts of tariffs and drag on exports from foreign retaliation that are already built into our US GDP forecast — why US GDP growth will likely underperform consensus expectations in 2025,” they said. Despite the worsening outlook, Oregon’s tourism commission — known as Travel Oregon — is continuing efforts to attract foreign visitors, said CEO Todd Davidson. His team just came back from a trip to pitch the state at an adventure tourism conference in Vancouver, and in the coming weeks they will be hosting sales and marketing partners from places like the UK, India and Brazil. At the same time, they’re also contemplating whether the commission will need to shift its strategy more toward domestic visitors as the situation unfolds. “Oregon is not and will not take its eye off those international markets,” Davidson said. “We will be here when our international visitors feel that they are ready to return.” (Updates to add Canada executives advising against US travel in ninth paragraph.) ©2025 Bloomberg L.P. PARIS (Reuters) -Nearly three dozen global pharmaceutical companies, in a letter to the head of the European Commission, demanded help to maintain operations in the EU despite threatened U.S. tariffs on imports, including measures to compensate them for the cost of pharmaceutical innovations, French business newspaper Les Echos reported on Tuesday.  In the letter sent to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the companies -- including Pfizer, Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca -- said they face cost disadvantages in Europe versus the United States, where drugs are sold at prices that on average are twice that of some European countries, such as France, Les Echos reported. Big Tech stocks are too important to be sacrificed in a trade war but a negotiated peace isn't yet on the table. Shares of Boeing — which considers China one of its biggest growth markets and where rival Airbus holds a dominant position — were down 0.5% in midday trading.  Confusion over changing tariffs could leave aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airline CEOs saying they would defer delivery of planes rather than pay duties.  China's top three airlines - Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines - had planned to take delivery of 45, 53 and 81 Boeing planes respectively between 2025 and 2027.

The US Commerce Department said Monday it had initiated probes into the national security impact of semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports, a precursor to imposing tariffs. The precious metal has rallied by more than a fifth this year as the worsening trade war has damped prospects for global growth, eroded trust in usually-safe US assets and roiled financial markets.

We recently published a list ofGoldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in. As we recentlydiscussedin another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities. So, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last. Warren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’sBerkshirepicks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities. Overall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio. So, let’s take a look at the top Goldman Sachs value stocks. Engineers using the latest Cisco TelePresence technology to collaborate with colleagues around the world. To compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Small-cap funds are good choices for investors seeking diversification across different sectors and companies. Investors with a high-risk appetite should pick these funds. Small-cap funds generally invest in companies with a market cap lower than $2 billion. The companies, though smaller in size, offer growth potential and their market capitalization may increase subsequently. Meanwhile, value stocks tend to trade at a price lower than their fundamentals (i.e., earnings, book value, debt-equity). It is common for some investors to consider value funds for income or yield. However, not all value funds consist solely of companies that primarily use their earnings to pay dividends. Investors interested in choosing value funds for yield should make sure to check the mutual fund yield. The mutual fund yield is dividend payments divided by the value of the mutual fund’s shares.

Goldman Sachs Groupreported strong first-quarter financial results, posting a net income rise to USD 4,738 million and announcing an aggressive share buyback program of USD 40,000 million, strengthening shareholder value. The company's stock appreciated by 8%, amid a broader market gain of 6.8%. Recent tensions between the U.S. and China may have injected some volatility, yet the company's robust earnings and share repurchase likely supported its impressive performance. While the Dow Jones saw upward momentum driven by banks and tech stocks, Goldman's financial results potentially amplified its upward trajectory, aligning with broader market trends. Be aware that Goldman Sachs Group is showing 2 risks in our investment analysis. Rare earth metals are the new gold rush. Find out which 21 stocks are leading the charge. The recent initiatives by Goldman Sachs, particularly the sizable US$40 billion share buyback program, aim to reinforce shareholder value, potentially lifting investor sentiment and supporting its ongoing share price momentum. Over the past five years, the company's total return, including share price growth and dividends, was 215.37%, showcasing its ability to produce substantial returns compared to the past year's performance against the US Capital Markets industry. Short-term volatility due to geopolitical tensions seems to have been largely mitigated by Goldman's robust earnings and strategic capital allocation. In terms of potential impact, the Capital Solutions Group's formation might capture private credit opportunities, possibly leading to revenue and earnings growth. Revenue is projected to rise 4.9% annually, underpinned by wealth management and operational efficiencies. However, analysts have varied opinions on earnings potential by 2028, which influences the fair value estimation. The current share price of US$462.22 presents a valuable perspective compared to the analyst consensus price target of US$612.0, indicating the share may be trading at a discount relative to expected future earnings.

The administration announced earlier it would conduct an investigation into drug imports. That move is widely seen as a first step toward imposing new levies.

We recently published a list ofGoldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in. As we recentlydiscussedin another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities. So, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last. Warren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’sBerkshirepicks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities. Overall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio. So, let’s take a look at the top Goldman Sachs value stocks. A group of business people discussing plans around a boardroom table adorned with a financial services company logo. To compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. sold a combined $14 billion of US investment-grade bonds Tuesday, matching the day-earlier total from peers Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Trump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space LA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs $15 Million Fund Bets Leadership Training Can Improve Chicago Policing Wells Fargo is issuing $8 billion of bonds in four parts, while Goldman sold $6 billion in three parts, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The market’s third borrower Tuesday, Japanese financial firm Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., priced $3 billion of notes. The longest portion of Wells’ offering, an 11-year security, yields 1.28 percentage point above Treasuries, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified as the details are private. Goldman’s longest portion, a six-year tranche, yields 1.25 percentage point above Treasuries, a separate person said. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Lead $16.5 Billion Bank Borrowing Spree It’s common for the biggest US banks to sell debt shortly after releasing quarterly results. But there were some questions this go-around after the primary market froze earlier this month in the wake of an evolving global trade war. Tuesday’s deals received orders 3.3 times the amount of bonds sold, according to Bloomberg’s Brian Smith, compared with 3.8 times on Monday. “Clearly there’s appetite for sizable bank issuances,” said Peter Simon, an analyst who covers the sector at research firm CreditSights. “We don’t see much evidence that the market is overly concerned with these banks, which makes sense given their results have been solid this quarter.” Goldman reported record revenue in the first quarter, while Wells Fargo’s report pointed to soft loan demand amid the ongoing tariff uncertainty. Wells’ net interest income, the difference between what it makes from lending and pays for deposits, fell short of analysts’ projections. Still, non-interest expenses were better than forecast as Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf works to cut costs. In the high-grade market, banks have underperformed in recent weeks, with TD Securities credit strategist Hans Mikkelsen writing that was likely due to expectations of new debt sales. The average bank bond spread widened 24 basis points this month through Monday, more than investment-grade notes overall while yields for the latter briefly hit 11-month highs last week. That has lured yield buyers into the market, setting things up well to digest the banks’ debt sales, said Samuel Wilson, a portfolio manager at Voya Investment Management. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. are candidates to issue debt after they released first-quarter results Tuesday. Coming into earnings season, JPMorgan strategists Kabir Caprihan and Vincent Barretta predicted the six big US banks could might issue about $32 billion of bonds. That compares with an average $23 billion this time each year from 2014 through 2024. The four deals completed so far have raised $28 billion. (Updates throughout.)

The rapid rise of ultra-fast fashion retailer Shein has been so key to the fortunes of a group of urban villages on the outskirts of China's southern metropolis of Guangzhou that they have been colloquially dubbed \"Shein villages\".  Shein was able to become a behemoth selling over $30 billion worth of goods annually on a foundation of cheap prices and advantageous trade rules, such as the U.S. \"de minimis\" exemption that allows low-cost imports to enter the country duty-free.  But the supply chain efficiencies emanating from hundreds of humming factory floors in these villages, reacting in real-time to online orders for leopard print palazzo pants or peasant blouses at unbeatable prices, were also key to its success.

We recently published a list ofGoldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in. As we recentlydiscussedin another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities. So, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last. Warren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’sBerkshirepicks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities. Overall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs.

All right, welcome. I'm Richard Stubbe, Hart Energy’s senior technology editor. I'm here with Neil Modeland, who is the senior business technology development manager forHalliburton. We've been talking about the Haynesville Shale and some of the things that Halliburton brings to it and some ofthe difficulties that the shale brings here. So Neil, do you want to talk a little bit about what Halliburton is doing in the shale and why it's difficult here? Neil Modeland, senior business technology development manager, Halliburton: Yeah, I think if you look at the Haynesville in general, we've talked about earlier going to longer laterals and more profit intensity than really any other play in North American land. Take a step back and look at what we're doing at Halliburton. We're really trying to minimize some of the costs associated with doing those huge completions in the Haynesville. So what can we do as a frac service provider to pull out some of those costs? One of those things is electrification. So we've got our ZEUS e-fleet [electric fleet] portfolio, and 40% of our fleets in North America are actually running e-fleets. RS: And you said that's going up. NM:Yes, and in 2025 we actually expect that to end the year with 50% on that. And really all of our dedicated fleets in the Haynesville currently are e-fleets. That's really helped on driving out some of the costs on a couple of different fronts. One [is] just replacing diesel with natural gas, right? You have got a lower cost commodity, and in the Haynesville we have field gas that we can actually burn to create the power generation to power the e-fleets. And that's going to be your total lowest total cost of ownership of any power generation is just burning the field gas. So we have that plentiful in the Haynesville, so that's going to lower the cost. But also the maintenance schedule and just the simplicity of the maintenance is better with our ZEUS fleet. In fact, last month our ZEUS fleets or electric fleets pumped 11% more horsepower hours on average than any of our diesel fleets. That comes because of more simplistic maintenance and just more uptime pumping these jobs and being able to do that better. RS: More uptime and less maintenance, that sounds like something I would also want for my car or something like that. But Halliburton is also doing a lot of work with automation, right? NM:Yeah. And really the e-fleets have been a good platform for that. Just the simplicity of control and then the full fleet control through our OCTIV platform has allowed us to step into automation. So last year we commercialized Auto Frac, which is really kind of push-button frac. We upload a typical frac schedule an operator would give us. We then sit down with the operator and talk through ‘what parameters, what target pressure would you like, max rate, target rate, how would you like to ramp up the stage, how would you like to bring down the stage?’ Then once all that's loaded in, it's kind of press button and here you go. So there's your automated frac. If you're riding top pressure, as your pressure breaks down, your rate will increase. That's very common in the Haynesville that we'll see that. We actually commercialized the Auto Frac in the Haynesville last year as well. To put it in perspective, the time savings we're seeing through that automation versus a manual operator, we're seeing about 10 minutes on average. In fact, the Bossier Shale versus the Haynesville Shale is a little more finicky. We actually see a closer to 15 minutes saved per stage pumping time versus a manual operator versus what we're doing with automation. RS: And we talked about 15 minutes, but it's 15 minutes plus 15 minutes plus times, times, times. NM:Yeah. 15 minutes times a hundred stages of, well, a two well pad and then several pads throughout the year, all of a sudden you have enough time to actually have that frac fleet go pump another well or two right by the end of the year. RS: Well fantastic. Thank you for being here and talking with us, and I really appreciate you just being part of the program. NM:My pleasure. Thanks for having. RS: Thank you.

Halliburton (HAL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 22, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. This provider of drilling services to oil and gas operators is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -21.1%. Revenues are expected to be $5.26 billion, down 9.4% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). For Halliburton, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.03%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Halliburton will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Halliburton would post earnings of $0.70 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.70, delivering no surprise. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once. An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Halliburton doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

Johnson & Johnson’sJNJ first-quarter 2025 earnings came in at $2.77 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57. Earnings rose 2.2% from the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings exclude intangible amortization expense and special items and reversal of special charges, which were previously reserved for the bankruptcy resolution. Including these items, reported earnings were $4.54 per share, up 238.8% year over year. Sales of this drug and medical devices giant came in at $21.89 billion, which marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.62 billion. (Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.) Sales rose 2.4% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an operational increase of 4.2% and a negative currency impact of 1.8%. Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and currency, sales rose 3.3% on an operational basis. First-quarter sales in the domestic market rose 5.9% to $12.3 billion. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures on an adjusted operational basis, domestic sales rose 4.4% in the quarter. International sales declined 1.8% on a reported basis to $9.59 billion, reflecting an operational increase of 2.1% and a negative currency impact of 3.9%. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures on an adjusted operational basis, international sales rose 1.9% in the quarter. With the complete separation of the Consumer Health segment into a newly listed company calledKenvueKVUE in 2023, J&J has now become a two-sector company focused on the Pharmaceutical and MedTech fields. KVUE will report its first-quarter results in early May. J&J’s Innovative Medicines segment sales rose 2.3% year over year to $13.87 billion, reflecting a 4.2% operational increase, offset by a 1.9% negative currency impact. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and currency on an adjusted operational basis, worldwide sales rose 4.4%. Innovative Medicines sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.46 billion as well as our model estimate of $13.57 billion. Higher sales of key products such as Darzalex, Tremfya and Erleada due to strong market growth and share gains drove the segment’s growth. Xarelto and Simponi/Simponi Aria sales also rose in the quarter. New drugs like Carvykti, Tecvayli, Talvey, Rybrevant and Spravato also contributed to growth. The sales growth was partially dampened by lower sales of key drugs, Stelara, Imbruvica, Uptravi, and generic/biosimilar competition to drugs like Zytiga and Remicade. Sales of blockbuster multiple myeloma medicine Darzalex rose 20.3% year over year to $3.24 billion in the quarter. Sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.13 billion and our model estimate of $3.15 billion. Sales of the blockbuster psoriasis drug Stelara declined 33.7% to $1.63 billion in the quarter due to the impact of current and potential biosimilar competition. While U.S. sales of Stelara declined 29.8%, international sales declined 38.9% in the quarter. Stelara sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.64 billion as well as our model estimate of $1.66 billion. A biosimilar version of Stelara was launched in certain European markets for some indications in July 2024. Several biosimilar versions of Stelara are expected to be launched in the United States in 2025.AmgenAMGN launched the first Stelara biosimilar, Wezlana, in January 2025, whileTeva Pharmaceutical IndustriesTEVA launched Selarsdi in February 2025. Both Amgen and Teva had entered into settlement agreements with J&J for their respective biosimilar launches. Stelara biosimilar competition is expected to accelerate throughout 2025 as the number of biosimilar entrants increases. Imbruvica sales declined 9.5% to $709.0 million. Rising competitive pressure in the United States due to new oral competition has been hurting Imbruvica's sales for the past few quarters. Imbruvica sales were, however, better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $678.0 million and our estimate of $703.0 Erleada generated sales of $771.0 million in the quarter, up 11.9% year over year. Erleada sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $817 million as well as our model estimate of $855.3 million. Tremfya recorded sales of $956.0 million in the quarter, up 18.2% year over year. Tremfya sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $939.0 million but missed our model estimate of $989.7 million. New drug Carvykti recorded sales of $369 million compared with $334 million in the previous quarter. Another new drug, Tecvayli, recorded sales of $151.0 million in the quarter, up 13.3% year over year, J&J began disclosing separate sales of new drugs, Talvey and Rybrevant, from the first quarter of 2025. Sales of Talvey were $86 million, up 48.4% year over year. Rybrevant sales were $141 million compared with $47 million in the year-ago quarter. Spravato recorded sales of $320.0 million, up 41.9% year over year. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) drug Uptravi recorded sales of $451.0 million, down 3.6% year over year. Another PAH drug, Opsumit, recorded sales of $522 million, down 0.5% year over year. Xarelto sales rose 33.3% in the quarter to $690.0 million. Invega Sustenna/Xeplion/Invega Trinza/Trevicta sales declined 14.5% to $903 million in the quarter. Simponi/Simponi Aria sales rose 18.9% to $659.0 million, while Prezista sales declined 3.7% to $403.0 million. Zytiga sales declined 30.9% to $129.0 million in the quarter due to generic competition. Sales of Remicade rose 7.5% in the quarter to $467.0 million. MedTech segment sales came in at $8.02 billion, up 2.5% from the year-ago period, as an operational increase of 4.1% was offset by a negative currency movement of 1.6%. MedTech segment sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as our model estimate of $8.14 billion. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, and currency, on an adjusted operational basis, worldwide sales rose 1.3%. Sales in the MedTech business are being driven by new product uptake and commercial execution, which is being partially offset by continued headwinds in Asia Pacific, specifically in China and increased competitive pressure in some MedTech businesses. Sales in China in the first quarter were hurt by the impact of the volume-based procurement (VBP) program. VBP is a government-driven cost containment effort in China. The company raised its sales expectations for 2025 to reflect the addition of schizophrenia drug Caplyta, following the $14.6 billion acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies closed earlier this month. The sales guidance was raised from a range of $89.2 billion-$90.0 billion to $91.0 billion-$91.8 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $90.22 billion. The sales range indicates growth in the range of 2.6%-3.6% versus the prior expectation of 0.5%-1.5%. Operational sales growth is expected in the range of 3.3%-4.3% (previously 2.5%-3.5%). The adjusted operational sales (excluding currency impact, acquisitions/divestitures) growth guidance was maintained in the range of 2.0%-3.0%. The adjusted earnings per share guidance was maintained in the range of $10.50-$10.70. J&J said that the guidance range includes tariff costs and dilution from the Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $10.54 per share. The earnings range implies growth in the range of 5.2% to 7.2%. J&J beat first-quarter estimates for both earnings and sales. Despite the loss of exclusivity (“LOE”) of Stelara, its Innovative Medicines unit once again outperformed expectations, with sales of key drugs Darzalex and Tremfya beating estimates. However, Erleada and Uptravi’s sales slightly missed expectations. The Stelara LOE hurt revenue growth by 810 basis points in the quarter. MedTech unit’s sales also missed estimates. J&J slightly raised its sales guidance while keeping the EPS range intact. J&J also announced a 4.8% increase in its quarterly dividend from $1.24 per share to $1.30 per share J&J’s shares were down around 1% in pre-market trading on Tuesday. So far this year, J&J’s stock has risen 7.6% against a decrease of 6.0% for the industry. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research J&J’s Innovative Medicine unit is showing a growth trend. In 2025, J&J expects growth in the Innovative Medicine segment to be driven by its key products, such as Darzalex, Tremfya, Spravato and Erleada, as well as new drugs like Carvykti, Tecvayli and Talvey, and new indications for Tremfya and Rybrevant. J&J is also making rapid progress with its pipeline and has been on an acquisition spree lately, which has strengthened its pipeline. However, the softness in the MedTech unit, the Stelara patent cliff and the potential impact of Part D redesign will be significant headwinds in 2025. It remains to be seen how the company navigates them. The legal battle surrounding its talc lawsuits has created a bearish sentiment around the stock. The lawsuits allege that its talc products contain asbestos, which caused many women to develop ovarian and some other cancers. Earlier this month, a bankruptcy court in Texas rejected J&J’s proposed bankruptcy plan to settle its talc lawsuits. J&J will go back to the traditional tort system to fight lawsuits individually, using its bankruptcy strategy to settle lawsuits that fail for the third time.

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported stronger-than-expected earnings. Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research head of the healthcare business unit Asad Haider joins Catalysts withMadison Millsand StoneX senior adviser Jon Hilsenrath to take a closer look at the earnings print and Johnson & Johnson's position as US President Trump pushes for tariffs on pharmaceutical imports. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere. Johnson & Johnson topped the street's expectations in its latest quarter, thanks to strong cancer drug sales during the 3-month period. The company boosted its full-year sales outlook, but tempered expectations for its adjusted operational profit, citing the impact of a recent acquisition and, of course, tariffs. President Trump has warned that levies will be placed on the sector very soon. Joining us now to discuss is Saad Hater, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research Head of the Healthcare Business Unit. Saad, great to speak with you. Let's start on Johnson & Johnson maintaining the EPS outlook. How were they able to do that in your view and what are your other big takeaways? Yeah, thanks for having me. Um so, there there were some questions. I mean, overall, we thought that the quarter was actually very encouraging and very much in line with the thesis uh that we have on Johnson & Johnson. And just to zoom out for a second, we upgraded the stock to buy last week, uh based on our view that the innovative medicine business is going to continue to surprise on the upside and show encouraging trends. And that's really what you saw. Now, there was some gross margin related pressure, um which they cited, uh they attributed to Part D dynamics. This is the first quarter that the pharma industry is going to see uh some headwinds from the inflation reduction act, uh particularly related to Part D. Uh and there were also some tariff related costs that they that they talked about, um about $400 million that they attributed to the MedTech business. But beneath the hood, uh the pharma business did really well and their operating margins actually beat because they flex the P&L by cutting costs and cutting R&D. And to us, that was actually a very encouraging sign. And I think the combination of those things, along with a little bit of an FX tailwind, had them maintain uh the earnings for the year. And how are you thinking about the impact of tariffs, both on on Johnson & Johnson, and then just moving forward? Because they are the first pharma name to report, what does the what what did their results tell you about how the rest of the industry might be impacted by tariffs as well? Well, the short answer is not much. And I think uh it's still all very uncertain. I think uh we all have been waiting to see what the announcement for tariffs is. I think what's known, of course, is that uh the the pharmaceutical industry is going to have be tariffed, the way semiconductors and autos and several other industries are. Uh we've been waiting for this for a while. What we also know is that there has already been a section 232 investigation that has begun. Uh and uh depending on how that goes, uh what we're all going to be waiting for is to see what level of tariffs are going to be applied to the industry. And uh at this point, I just don't think we have a lot of clarity on any of that. And so, what that's been doing is creating a lot of uncertainty across the entire pharmaceutical sector. It's making people question the traditional orthodoxy around the margin structure and the profitability of this sector. But we just don't know a lot right now, and I think it would be too early for me to speculate on where this all lands. Uh but this is a cloud that the sector that it's an overhang on the sector. And until we get a real off-ramp, uh it's going to be hard to see how that uh um you know, how that overhang goes away. And Saad, my guest host, John Hilsenrath, is still with me. John, you got a question for Saad? Saad, you you talk about J&J flexing their earnings muscle by cutting costs and cutting R&D. Uh I'm listening to hear how all of this affects the economy, and that sounds like bad news to me. Well, I don't think it's I don't think it's bad news necessarily. I mean, I think we don't we don't really know uh line items on what exactly they did on the SG&A and the R&D side. I think it just speaks a little bit to the leverage that they have across the P&L to uh you know, make these types of investments. I think what's more interesting is just the way that Johnson & Johnson is has been responding, as I expect others to to to these tariff threats, which is uh building uh infrastructure, manufacturing facilities in the US. I think everyone saw that uh about 3 weeks ago, they announced a $55 billion manufacturing commitment to the US that is higher, that's about 25% higher than what they had initially said they'd do. Uh they opened a new facility in North Carolina, which they are going to use to manufacture in the US. And there's three other facilities that they're going to bring on the manufacturing side that are yet to come. So, I think those types of measures are probably more important for, as far as the overall economy goes, than them, these pharma companies, really flexing the the the the P&L in there with with things like SG&A and and R&D. Yeah, Saad, I'm also curious how you're thinking about the impact of China and any China demand on this. John, I wonder if you have a question to that end as well. Well, I I mean, I'm I'm interested in in China, and I'm also interested in, you know, the risk that that they cut off supply chains and that that affects the supply chain of the pharma industry. I mean, John, I just don't think we know. I just think it's just too early to speculate how this all plays out. Um like I said, uh there are we are right now navigating navigating a period in the pharmaceutical sector where there are just a lot more questions than there are answers. I think it would be too premature for me to speculate uh on, you know, where uh what gets tariffed, what happens with China, what happens with demand. Um but our focus is just on fundamentals, and our call on J&J really has to do with the fact that their pharma business and some of the new product cycles within their pharma business are actually underappreciated, based on some of the diligence that we've done. And once this blows through, I mean, that's really where we'd be guiding investors. Johnson & Johnson is holding its earnings outlook steady despite President Donald Trump signaling he could put tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry. The administration announced earlier it would conduct an investigation into drug imports. That move is widely seen as a first step toward imposing new levies. Earnings and revenue both beat estimates for the quarter. Johnson & Johnson CFO Joe Wolk joined Bloomberg Open Interest to talk about how tariffs could hit the industry and the drug maker's bottom line. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of 7.78% and 1.26%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 2025. Do the numbers hold clues to what lies ahead for the stock? J&J faces several headwinds at the start of the year, including patent expiry, talc litigation, and, now, tariffs. Johnson & Johnson plans to seek a U.S. indication for multiple general surgery procedures, including gastric bypass, which was performed in the clinical trial. Futures edged down Tuesday morning, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow trading just below break-even, as investors braced for a flurry of corporate earnings. The muted open followed Monday’s tech-led rally, which briefly masked deeper market jitters tied to tariffs and macro uncertainty. New tariffs, primarily on medical technology products, are projected to add $400 million in costs this year, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said.

We recently published a list ofJim Cramer’s Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. On Friday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer outlined what investors should focus on in the week, especially pointing to earnings reports from major banks. “Rumor, innuendo, intrigue these are the stuff of great novels, of fabulous miniseries, riveting plays, and now they’re the stuff of the stock market.” READ ALSO:Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocksand10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently. He noted the chaotic nature of the current environment and remarked that “this tape has it all,” and emphasized how unpredictable developments from the White House have added to the turbulence. Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes. “Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,” he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, “Except this isn’t an eight-part blockbuster, it’s our money.” Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday’s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic. Cramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a “liberation day bottom,” a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, “Not sure, I’m just not sure.” He added: “Have you ever noticed the weekends don’t provide relaxation anymore because the president’s got advisors? He’s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He’s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime…. Monday’s trading, well, let’s just say that it looks like that it’s earning season so it’s gonna be even harder than usual.” For this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11.

J&J isn't doing anything differently yet in response to tariffs, Wolk added. Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday reported better-than-expected first-quarter results and lifted its sales forecast for the full year. While J&J expects tariffs will cost it $400 million this year, the company maintained its earnings estimate and upped its sales guidance for 2025. J&J is projecting a $400m hit due to US tariffs in 2025, but reaffirmed its profit outlook while raising its sales forecast. Johnson & Johnson is holding its earnings outlook steady despite President Donald Trump signaling he could put tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry. The administration announced earlier it would conduct an investigation into drug imports. That move is widely seen as a first step toward imposing new levies. Earnings and revenue both beat estimates for the quarter. Johnson & Johnson CFO Joe Wolk joined Bloomberg Open Interest to talk about how tariffs could hit the industry and the drug maker's bottom line. Citigroup (C) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of 6.52% and 1.95%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 2025. Do the numbers hold clues to what lies ahead for the stock? New tariffs, primarily on medical technology products, are projected to add $400 million in costs this year, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said. While the top- and bottom-line numbers for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) give a sense of how the business performed in the quarter ended March 2025, it could be worth looking at how some of its key metrics compare to Wall Street estimates and year-ago values. Johnson & Johnson stock fell alongside the broader market, despite beating first-quarter calls and hiking its 2025 sales guidance. J&J beats first-quarter earnings and sales estimates. It raises sales guidance for 2025 to reflect the addition of Caplyta from the Intra-Cellular acquisition.

Stocks closed lower Tuesday, snapping a two-day rally as investor jitters returned to the fore. The S&P 500 slipped 0.22%, the Dow fell 0.36%, and the Nasdaq edged down 0.05%. Despite recent gains, all three major indices remain well below their pre-April 2 levels, when President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements first rattled markets. Read more:Wall Street banks are cashing in on trade war chaos. Auto stocks fell despite fresh rumors of a possible reprieve on tariffs. Ford, GM, and Rivian each ended the day lower, following a new forecast from S&P Global Ratings (SPGI) projecting a 700,000-unit drop in annual U.S. car sales if tariffs move ahead. “Affordability challenges and elevated interest rates are already pressuring demand,” analysts wrote. “Tariffs would only exacerbate those headwinds.” Tech and financial names led the upside among individual stocks. Palantir surged more than 6% following news that NATO finalized its purchase of the company’s AI-powered Maven Smart System. Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 5% amid ongoing activist investor pressure, and Netflix (NFLX) added nearly 5%. Bank of America and Citigroup also posted solid gains after beating first-quarter earnings expectations, fueled by strong trading revenue and consumer banking results. Investors are now looking ahead to fresh earnings from United Airlines (UAL) and The Trade Desk (TTD), both due after the bell, and to a Wednesday slate that includes Abbott Labs (ABT) and U.S. Bancorp (USB)—reports that should offer further insight into consumer health and the state of regional lending. Stocks opened higher Tuesday, with tech and bank names leading the charge as investors welcomed a morning packed with strong earnings and fresh deal buzz. Big banks were in rally mode: Citigroup, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs all ticked higher after posting better-than-expected results,fueled by strong trading revenues. Palantir Technologies jumped 4% after NATO finalized its purchase of the company’s AI-powered Maven Smart System — another boost for the defense-tech darling after Monday’s rally. Apple also edged higher, extending its 2% gain from Monday, which followed a surprise tariff exemption from the Trump administration. Meanwhile, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) caught a wave of investor enthusiasm after activist firm Elliott Investment Management revealed a $1.5 billion stake and backed the company’s newly announced strategic review. The broader market got a lift as chipmakers, software stocks, and AI plays rode the wave, with early signs pointing to a tech-led session and plenty of earnings drama still to come. Auto stocks gave back some of Monday’s gains, with Rivian (RIVN), Ford, and GM trading lower despite President Trump floating a potential delay in auto tariffs. “A US car with all US parts made in the US is a fictional tale,” analysts at Wedbush wrote, warning that the proposed tariffs — if not paused — could send the industry into “upside down mode” and trigger widespread supply-chain disruption. U.S. stock futures edged down Tuesday morning, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average trading just below the break-even line as investors braced fora flurry of corporate earnings. The subdued start followeda tech-driven rally on Monday, a temporary lift amid lingering concerns around tariffs andbroader economic uncertainty. Goldman Sachs (GS) kicked off the week’s earnings slate with a profit jump, even asCEO David Solomon warned of a “markedly different” environmentin the current quarter. Echoing Solomon’s sentiments, in March, hedge fundsunloadedglobal stocks at the fastest pace in over a decade — a sign that institutional investors may be growing more cautious as economic uncertainty deepens. Tuesday’s earnings lineup includes Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and Rent the Runway (RENT) before the bell, offering a pulse check across finance, healthcare, and consumer spending. Bank of America beat expectations in the first quarter, with EPS of $0.90 on $27.37 billion in revenue, lifted by a strong showing in its trading division. Like Goldman Sachs, the bank benefited from market volatility, which juiced results even as the broader economic outlook remains uncertain. Looking to Bank of America’s consumer banking division, revenue rose 3% to $10.5 billion, with combined credit and debit card spend hitting $228 billion — up 4% from a year ago. The bank added about 250,000 new consumer checking accounts, marking its 25th straight quarter of growth, and saw 4 billion digital logins, with 65% of sales now digitally enabled. Still, CEO Brian Moynihan struck a cautious tone, noting that “we potentially face a changing economy in the future.” Citigroup posted first-quarter 2025 net income of $4.1 billion, or $1.96 per share, on $21.6 billion in revenue — a 3% increase from a year ago. Growth was broad-based across all five core businesses, with standout performances in the markets and wealth divisions. U.S. personal banking revenue rose 2% to $5.2 billion, powered by gains in branded cards and retail banking, though partially offset by a drop in retail services. Net interest income climbed 6%, fueled by loan growth in branded cards and wider deposit spreads in its retail banking. Johnson & Johnson beat Wall Street expectations in the first quarter, reporting adjusted earnings per share of $2.77 on revenue of $21.89 billion. Sales of cancer drug Darzalex jumped 20% year over year to $3.24 billion, helping drive 4.2% growth in the company’s “innovative medicine” segment. The healthcare giant raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $91.6 billion and $92.4 billion, reflecting the impact of its Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition and the addition of Caplyta, a treatment for bipolar depression. However, adjusted EPS guidance held steady at $10.50 to $10.70 as the company factors in tariffs, deal-related costs, and currency headwinds. J&J also moved to reverse $7 billion previously set aside for talc-related legal settlements, after courts rejected its bankruptcy-based strategy for resolving lawsuits over its discontinued baby powder. The company maintains the claims are without merit and says it will defend them in state courts. During a television appearance on Monday, former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that Trump’s economic strategy is eroding global trust in U.S. financial assets, with volatility in Treasury yields reflecting broad investor unease. Treasury yields continued to climb on Tuesday, with the 10-year yield reaching 4.43%, as investors reacted to ongoing trade tensions and concerns over inflation. The bond market’s volatility has raised questions about the long-term stability of U.S. financial assets. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 added about 0.8% on Monday, while the Nasdaq climbed about 0.6%. All three indexes briefly slipped into the red before rebounding, buoyed by tech stocks after the Trump administrationissued a surprise tariff exemption. Apple (AAPL) stockgained more than 2%on Monday, while Palantir Technologies (PLTR) surged almost 5% following news that NATO had finalized itsMaven Smart Systempurchase.

Johnson & Johnsonrecently announced a 4.8% increase in its quarterly dividend and released positive Phase 3 clinical data for icotrokinra, an oral treatment for plaque psoriasis. These events occurred alongside solid earnings reports, with a significant rise in net income and earnings per share compared to the previous year. While the company's stock price increased by 6.64% over the last quarter, the broader market also trended upward, climbing 5.9% in the past year. These company developments likely complemented the overall market movements and investor sentiment, rather than diverging from broader trends. You should learn about the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Johnson & Johnson. Outshine the giants: these 25 early-stage AI stocks could fund your retirement. Johnson & Johnson's recent dividend increase and positive Phase 3 clinical data for icotrokinra could significantly bolster investor confidence by enhancing perceptions of future earnings potential and revenue growth. The company's total return, including dividends, was 17.11% over the past five years, indicating steady but moderate financial performance. This is set against the backdrop of a one-year underperformance relative to the US Pharmaceuticals industry's 7% decline. Looking forward, these announcements could positively influence earnings forecasts, especially with expected boosts from TREMFYA and RYBREVANT within the Innovative Medicine segment. This aligns with strategic acquisitions and product launches that have been projected to grow revenue and expand market footprint. Despite these gains, competition and economic pressures remain considerations, particularly in international markets like China. Currently trading at US$150, the share price reflects a modest discount to the analyst consensus price target of US$171.11. This implies potential upside and suggests market expectations are still reconciling with Johnson & Johnson's future growth prospects. Revenue and earnings forecasts will likely incorporate these developments, while still being mindful of existing risks such as biosimilar competition and macroeconomic pressures.

Health care giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) expects about $400 million in tariff-related costs this year. The costs will be felt primarily within the company's medical technology unit, which makes a range of medical devices and surgical products. The most substantial impact comes from tariffs against China and retaliatory tariffs from China, said Joseph Wolk, Johnson & Johnson's chief financial officer, in a conference call with analysts following the company's latest earnings results. The company's estimate also includes the impact from tariffs on aluminum and steel, along with tariffs against key U.S. trading partners Canada and Mexico. Johnson & Johnson said that contractual agreements already in place limit its leverage on price increases that could potentially soften the impact. The cost estimate does not include possible tariffs on imports of pharmaceuticals. The Trump administration has launched an investigation into imports of pharmaceuticals, which is a step towards imposing tariffs. Tariffs, especially on pharmaceutical products, could lead to supply chain issues and shortages, said CEO Joaquin Duato. He said the best way to build up manufacturing in the U.S. is through tax policy, not tariffs.

(Operator Instructions) I now turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Jessica Moore Hello, everyone. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the first quarter of 2025, and our updated financial outlook.A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding among other things the company's future operating and financial performance, market position, and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on the current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.A description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2024 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.Moving to today's agenda. Joaquin Duato, our Chairman and CEO, will open with a few comments on our performance and key catalysts for the company. John Reed, our Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine, R&D, will highlight recent data from select assets.I will then review the first quarter sales and P&L results. Joe Wolk, our CFO, will then close by sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and guidance for 2025. Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine; and Tim Schmid, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, MedTech, will be joining us for Q&A.To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last slightly over 60 minutes. With that, I will now turn the call over to Joaquin. Joaquin Duato Thank you, Jess and hello everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered strong operational sales growth of 4.2% across our business. Our Q1 performance reinforces my confidence in our 2025 guidance and reflects the strength of Johnson & Johnson's uniquely diversified business, with year-over-year sales increases in both our Innovative Medicine and MedTech sectors.No other healthcare company has delivered growth through the first year of losing exclusivity for a multi-billion dollar product, in our case, STELARA, and yet that is exactly what we are doing. Our resiliency is a testament to what makes us unique. We are not just a pharmaceutical company or a MedTech company, we are a healthcare company, innovating across the full spectrum of disease.Our consistent strong performance is a testament to our capabilities across commercial, R&D, and supply chain. It is also a reflection of our strength in execution, which you can see in our quarterly results. We have described 2025 as a catalyst year. It is a year that will set us up for accelerated growth through the second half of the decade and beyond.In Q1, the power of our portfolio and pipeline was on full display. In Innovative Medicine, we delivered 4.2% operational sales growth despite an approximate 810 basis points headwind from STELARA, with 11 key brands growing double digits.With our third consecutive quarter of sales above $3 billion, DARZALEX continues to set the standard in multiple myeloma with another quarter of over 20% growth. In fact, just last week, we expanded our DARZALEX indication in Europe with the approval of DARZALEX based quadruplet regimen for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, regardless of transplant eligibility.It is further proof of the impact of this medicine, which together with CARVYKTI, TALVEY and TECVAYLI is changing the conversation from treating to progression to treating to cure. Other significant oncology portfolio advancements in Q1 included Phase 3 data presented at ELCC last month, showing RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE extended overall survival by more than one year versus the current standard of care in first-line EGFR mutated lung cancer.Our last week, the European Commission approved subcutaneous RYBREVANT in combination with LAZCLUZE for the treatment of EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer. This was an important milestone for patients as subcutaneous RYBREVANT reduces administration time from hours to minutes.Our aspiration is for RYBREVANT to LAZCLUZE to become the new standard of care for these patients, and you can see our progress in Q1. In immunology, we are seeing the impact of TREMFYA's entry into inflammatory bowel disease, with our launch in ulcerative colitis, helping accelerate operational sales growth to 20%. And with our recent FDA approval in colon disease, I'm more confident than ever that this blockbuster drug will become the gold standard for IBD patients and a $10 billion plus product.Turning to MedTech. In Q1, we delivered 4.1% operational sales growth with strong performance in our recently acquired cardiovascular businesses Abiomed and Shomed as well as in surgical vision and wound closure.In addition to their contribution to MedTech growth, Abiomed and Shomed continue to meet deal model expectations and both announced important portfolio milestones this quarter. These included updates to the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines for our Impella heart pump, which based on evidence from the DanGer Shock trial was upgraded from Class 2b to Class 2a.And in Shomed, the team launched the first of its kind, Javelin Peripheral IVL catheter for the treatment of difficult to cross lesions in peripheral artery disease. In electrophysiology, we resumed US VARIPULSE cases. And to date, we have completed more than 5,500 cases globally.Turning to surgery. We recently announced we have started OTTAVA clinical trials with a procedure that supports submission for US FDA de novo in general surgery with an indication for multiple upper abdomen procedures.This is an important milestone as we continue to strengthen our presence in robotic surgery. Beyond our existing portfolio and pipeline, we also fortified our leadership as an innovation powerhouse with two major announcements.In March, we announced our commitment to invest more than $55 billion in the US over the next four years in manufacturing, R&D, and technology. This represents a 25% increase in investment compared to the previous four years.It builds upon the company's already elevated commitment to the US economy while expanding our capacity to manufacture next generation medicine and devices for patients in America and around the world.The investment includes four planned new manufacturing facilities, the first of which broke ground last month in North Carolina. And at the beginning of April, we announced the completion of our acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies, which extends Johnson & Johnson's industry leading portfolio in central nervous system disorders.With the addition of CAPLYTA, we have expanded our lineup of therapies with at least $5 billion plus potential in peak year sales, further solidifying sales growth above analyst expectations now through the rest of the decade.Turning to the Talc bankruptcy ruling. As we shared a few weeks ago, we will return to the tort system where we expect continual success in litigating these meritless claims. In terms of next steps, we will immediately pursue our merchant spending in the [multi-dislitigation] to exclude plaintiffs experts known as the downward challenge.And finally, as announced this morning, we increased our dividend for the 63rd consecutive year, which we know is important to our shareholders. We had a strong start to 2025, and I'm looking forward to sharing many more successes throughout the year.Recognizing that there have been many important milestones and data readouts in the quarter, I will now pass the call to John Reed for an Innovative Medicine R&D update. John Reed Thank you, Joaquin. I'm excited to share a few highlights from our industry leading Innovative Medicine pipeline that occurred throughout the quarter. With the successful acquisition of Intra-Cellular, I want to focus on CAPLYTA, a remarkable medicine with balanced pharmacology that delivers robust efficacy, combined with a favorable tolerability profile for neuropsychiatric disorders.CAPLYTA is already approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and is the only medicine approved for the treatment of depression in both bipolar 1 and 2 as either monotherapy or adjunctive therapy.On this slide, we're sharing data for major depressive disorder, showing very impressive and consistent improvements in the standard depression scoring metric MADRS in both Phase 3 studies that served as the basis for submission of the supplemental new drug application to the FDA. We anticipate approval of CAPLYTA later this year as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder, representing the largest of the indications for novel antidepressant drugs today.Turning to oncology. We are so excited about our recent overall survival data for RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE in first-line non-small cell lung cancer, harboring EGF receptor gene mutations. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most prevalent type of lung cancer, making up about 85% of lung cancer diagnosis.Sadly, less than 20% of people diagnosed with this form of the disease are alive after five years and only a fraction live long enough to try a second treatment. That's why it is so important to use the best treatment first.In a head-to-head study against today's standard of care, our RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE regimen improved overall survival by more than a year with the Kaplan-Meier survival curves continuing to separate at 37.8 months median follow-up.With RYBREVANT's triple mechanism of action, we're looking to reset the standard five year survival expectations in a never before same way. In simplest terms, we are giving patients more hope that they may live to celebrate another birthday, anniversary, or other important family event, a truly practice-changing achievement.Now moving on to immunology. I draw your attention to the recent FDA approval of TREMFYA in Crohn's disease, our fourth indication for TREMFYA. TREMFYA is currently the only IL-23 inhibitor, with the flexibility of subcutaneous administration for both induction and maintenance dosing for the treatment of Crohn's disease, which means patients can start their treatment by self-administering with results as rapid and robust as receiving the IV in a clinic or doctor's office.Additionally, in a recent head-to-head study in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, TREMFYA demonstrated superiority versus STELARA in all pooled endoscopic endpoints. As the only dual-acting IL-23 inhibitor, TREMFYA neutralizes IL-23, while also binding to CD64 and immune cells that produce IL-23, thus localizing TREMFYA right at the source of inflammation. TREMFYA continues to offer an exceptional solution for patients struggling with inflammatory bowel disease.Lastly, highlighting some of our latest data for our investigational oral IL-23 pathway inhibitor, icotrokinra, we are aiming to redefine the standard of care for people living with plaque psoriasis. Icotrokinra is the first and only targeted oral peptide that selectively blocks the IL-23 receptor.In two placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies, icotrokinra demonstrated impressive complete skin clearance and a favorable safety profile in a once daily pill. Our Phase 3 data demonstrated that nearly half of adult patients and three quarters of adolescents with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis treated with icotrokinra achieved completely clear skin by week 24.We also reported that icotrokinra achieved the prespecified endpoints in additional Phase 3 psoriasis studies, comparing our molecule head-to-head with the most commonly prescribed TYK2 inhibitor. Those data will be shared in an upcoming medical Congress.Looking forward, we are initiating the first ever head-to-head study seeking to demonstrate the superiority of a pill, icotrokinra, compared to an injectable biologic, STELARA, in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, representing an important step forward in psoriasis research. As a reminder, we intend to file icotrokinra for approval later this year.Finally, beyond psoriasis, we recently announced positive top line results from ANTHEM-UC, our Phase 2b study of icotrokinra in adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. That study showed that icotrokinra achieved impressive clinical remission rates, combined with a favorable safety profile, again, dosed as a once-daily pill.With all this progress, you can understand why we continue to be excited about the potential of icotrokinra to transform the treatment paradigm for patients battling with autoimmune diseases. Overall, across all our therapeutic areas, we are absolutely thrilled with the progress that our pipeline has made in the first quarter of this year, and we are eager to report on other significant milestones scheduled for the remainder of 2025.And now I will turn the call over to Jess. Jessica Moore Thank you, John. Moving to our financial results. Unless otherwise stated, the percentages quoted represent operational results, and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Starting with Q1 2025 sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.9 billion for the quarter.Sales increased 4.2% despite an approximate 470 basis point headwind from STELARA. Growth in the US was 5.9% and 2.1% outside of the US. Worldwide growth was positively impacted by 90 basis points due to acquisitions and divestitures.Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $11 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $4.54, versus diluted earnings per share of $1.34 a year ago, primarily driven by the reversal of $7 billion related to the Talc settlement proposal.Excluding after tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.7 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.77, representing increases of 1.9% and 2.2%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2024.We are proud to deliver bottom line growth despite the loss of exclusivity of STELARA and the impact of Part D redesign. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide sales of $13.9 billion increased 4.2%, despite an approximate 810 basis point headwind from STELARA. Growth in the US was 6.3% and 1.5% outside of the US.Starting with oncology. DARZALEX growth was 22.5%, primarily driven by continued share gains of approximately 3 points across all lines of therapy and approximately 5 points in the frontline setting as well as market growth.CARVYKTI achieved sales of $369 million and growth of over 100%, driven by share gains and capacity expansion. This reflects sequential growth of 10.5% as we continue to expand outside of the US. TECVAYLI and TALVEY growth was 15% and 50.2%, respectively, reflecting strong launches in the relapsed refractory setting.Patient demand remained strong despite continued adoption of longer dosing intervals. ERLEADA continued to deliver strong growth of 14.6% despite the impact of Part D redesign, primarily driven by share gains and market growth. RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE continued its strong launch trajectory with sales of $141 million and growth over 100%.Within immunology, TREMFYA delivered growth of 20.1% despite the impact of Part D redesign, driven by share gains and market growth across all indications, including our newly launched indication in ulcerative colitis.STELARA declined 32.3% driven by the impact of biosimilar competition and Part D redesign. As a reminder, REMICADE and SIMPONI distribution rights in Europe were returned in Q4. This positively impacted results in the quarter and is anticipated to continue for the remainder of the year. REMICADE sales also include a one-time patient mix benefit in the US.In neuroscience, SPRAVATO growth of 42.9% was driven by increased physician and patient demand. Finally, other assets that were impacted by Part D redesign include INVEGA long-acting injectables, which declined 13.5%. Pulmonary hypertension, which declined 1.2% and was partially offset by market growth and share gains. And XARELTO, which increased by 33% and also included a one-time patient mix benefit.I'll now turn your attention to Medtech. Worldwide sales of $8 billion increased 4.1%, with growth of 5.1% in the US and 3% outside of the US. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 280 basis points on worldwide growth, 420 basis points in the US and 120 basis points outside of the US.Underlying Medtech performance was driven by commercial execution and strength of new products, partially offset by several one-time events, disproportionately impacting orthopedics, in addition to continued competitive PFA pressures in electrophysiology and headwinds in China. Results were negatively impacted by approximately 210 basis points worldwide, 240 in the US and 180 outside of the US due to these one-time events.In cardiovascular, electrophysiology growth was roughly flat versus prior year, driven by lapping of prior year inventory dynamics in Asia, impacting worldwide results by roughly 310 basis points and competitive PFA ablation catheter pressure.This was mostly offset by global procedure growth, new product uptake, and commercial execution. Abiomed delivered growth of 14%, driven by strong growth in all regions and continued adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella CP technology.Cardiovascular results also included $258 million associated with the acquisition of Shockwave. As a reminder, we will lap the acquisition benefit at the end of May. Envision, contact lenses and other grew 2.7%, driven by continued strategic price actions and strong performance in the ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products.Surgical vision growth of 6.2% was driven by our recent innovations, TECNIS Odyssey, PureSee, and Eyhance, as well as commercial execution, partially offset by competitive pressures in the US. Surgery grew 1.1%, with divestitures negatively impacting results by approximately 180 basis points.Performance was driven primarily by commercial execution and the continued strength and adoption of new products across wound closure and biosurgery. Growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in energy and endocutters as well as the negative impact of China VBP.Given the disproportionate impact of the one-time events to orthopedics, I'd like to draw your attention to this additional slide. Orthopedics declined 3.1%, primarily driven by the lapping of a one-time revenue recognition timing change related to certain products across all platforms in the US, fewer selling days and revenue disruption from the previously announced orthopedics transformation.These one-time events negatively impacted worldwide orthopedics growth by approximately 480 basis points, 650 basis points in the US and 210 basis points outside of the US. This was partially offset by success of new product launches and commercial execution.Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2025. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 320 basis points, driven by unfavorable transactional currency and product mix, primarily due to the decline of STELARA in Innovative Medicine as well as the fair value step-up and amortization associated with the Shockwave acquisition in MedTech.Selling, marketing and administrative expenses improved 130 basis points, driven by operating spend management and phasing of investments, primarily in Innovative Medicine. Research and development expenses leveraged by 190 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio progression towards commercialization and phasing of investments in Innovative Medicine, partially offset by investments associated with the recent acquisitions of Shockwave and V-Wave in MedTech.Interest income and expense was a net income of $128 million as compared to $209 million in the first quarter of 2024, primarily driven by higher interest rates paid on higher average debt balances. Other income and expense was a net income of $7.3 billion compared to an expense of $2.4 billion in the prior year, driven by the $7 billion Talc reserve reversal in the first quarter of 2025 and the $2.7 billion Talc settlement proposal recorded during the first quarter of 2024.Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 19.3% versus 12.4% in the same period last year, primarily driven by the tax effect of the reversal of the Talc settlement accrual. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.3% versus 16.5% in the same period last year.I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided the company's income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items.Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment for the quarter. New this quarter and to continue our efforts of increased financial transparency, you will find GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations by segment in the supplemental schedules of our press release.Innovative Medicine margin declined from 42.9% to 42.5%, primarily driven by unfavorable transactional currency and product mix and cost of products sold and Part D redesign, partially offset by operating leverage.MedTech margin declined from 26.4% to 25.9%, primarily driven by R&D and selling, marketing and administrative investments associated with the recent acquisition of Shockwave and V-Wave. As a result, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 36.8% to 36.6%. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call, and I will now turn the call over to Joe. Joseph Wolk Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Thanks, Jessica. Not just for the transition now but also for how well you have led the Investor Relations function in the past few years. The investment community will miss you, but we look forward to seeing you in the lead finance role for Innovative Medicine. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strength and reliability of Johnson & Johnson's diversified business model.Innovative Medicine achieved robust growth in the face of STELARA biosimilar entrants and we advanced our pipeline, attaining significant clinical and regulatory milestones. In MedTech, as indicated in January, we anticipate pockets of challenge early on and are planning for higher second half growth in those areas of our business.The team is focused on commercial execution and accelerating the recently launched products to deliver MedTech's commitments that are included in the company's full year guidance. The recent acquisitions of Abiomed and Shockwave continue to expand our presence in higher growth markets.In addition, we continue to take steps to improve MedTech's future margin profile, implementing a restructuring program designed to simplify and focus the operations of our surgery business, similar to what we launched in orthopedics in 2023.Focusing on portfolio renewal, we plan to exit certain non-strategic product lines globally and optimize select sites across the network. We anticipate some modest short term revenue disruption in surgery of approximately $250 million in total over the next two years, but these actions will improve our ability to accelerate growth and enhance profitability. The program is expected to be completed in 2027, with cost estimated at approximately $900 million.Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We are pleased with free cash flow generation in the quarter of approximately $3.4 billion. We ended the first quarter with $38.8 billion of cash in marketable securities and $52.3 billion of debt for a net debt position of $13.5 billion.It is important to note that cash and net debt were favorably impacted by approximately $14 billion of cash held in anticipation of the Intra-Cellular acquisition, which closed on April 2. Taking this into consideration, net debt would have been approximately $27.5 billion.Investment in innovation remains the highest priority in our capital deployment. And during the first quarter, we invested more than $3 billion in research and development, approximately 15% of sales. We also remain committed to returning capital directly to shareholders.We recognize the value investors place on our dividend, and we were pleased to announce today that our Board of Directors authorized a 4.8% increase, marking our 63rd consecutive year of dividend increases. The Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition bolsters our neuroscience portfolio and we maintain a disciplined approach to inorganic growth, focusing on acquisitions and partnerships that align strategically and offer value creation.As noted in our Talc investor call and following up on some of Joaquin's earlier comments, we reversed $7 billion of the reserve previously held for the bankruptcy plan. This litigation has not, and we foresee will not impact our ability to execute upon our capital allocation priorities to appropriately manage our business.Let's now discuss our full year guidance for 2025. We are increasing our operational sales guidance for the full year by $700 million to reflect the addition of CAPLYTA following the completion of the Intra-Cellular acquisition. Therefore, we now expect operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 3.3% to 4.3%, with a midpoint of $92 billion or 3.8%.Excluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, we are maintaining our adjusted operational sales growth to the range of 2% to 3% compared to 2024. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. And last quarter, we utilized the euro spot rate relative to the US dollar of $1.04. Last week, the euro spot rate relative to the US dollar was $1.11.We estimate an incremental positive foreign currency impact of $1.1 billion versus previous guidance, resulting in a full year headwind of $600 million. As such, we now expect reported sales growth between 2.6% to 3.6%, with a midpoint of $91.4 billion or 3.1%.Turning to other notable items on the P&L. We are maintaining our guide of operating margin improvement by 300 basis points versus 2024. This improvement takes into consideration the dilution from the Intra-Cellular transaction as well as what we know today about the impact of tariffs on our business.We now project net interest expense between $100 million and $200 million, primarily driven by financing costs associated with the Intra-Cellular acquisition. Other income is anticipated to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, a slight increase versus previous guidance.Despite $0.25 dilution from the Intra-Cellular acquisition and including the impact of tariffs based on what is in place today, we are pleased to be able to maintain our adjusted reported earnings per share guidance of 6.2% at the midpoint for a range of $10.50 to $10.70, partially aided by the reduced FX impact.I'll now provide some qualitative considerations on phasing for your models. We continue to expect both Innovative Medicine and MedTech operational sales growth to be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half.Regarding Innovative Medicine, we maintain the assumption that the impact of STELARA biosimilar competition will accelerate throughout the year, similar to HUMIRA's erosion curve, which is still our proxy with the additive impact of Part D redesign.The impact of Part D redesign on affected products as a percent of sales will be consistently applied throughout the year, aligned with how we traditionally account for similar discount and rebate programs. Naturally, we expect a greater benefit from our newly launched products as the year progresses.Regarding MedTech, we expect normalized procedure volume and seasonality. And of course, we anniversary the Shockwave acquisition at the end of May. We anticipate our newly launched products to build throughout the year with the relaunch of VARIPULSE in the US, the introductions of dual energy STSF in the EU, Dellas Unity, VELYS Spine and TECHNIS Odyssey.Lastly, this slide highlights the one-time prior year P&L items that should be taken into quarterly consideration for your models. Beyond our financial commitments and what Joaquin and John mentioned, we are excited for the pipeline progress planned for the remainder of 2025.In Innovative Medicine, this includes expected approvals in nipocalimab for generalized myasthenia gravis, subcutaneous RYBREVANT for non-small cell lung cancer in the US, TREMFYA subcutaneous induction for ulcerative colitis, and CAPLYTA for adjunctive major depressive disorder.We continue our rolling submission of TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and anticipate filing icotrokinra in psoriasis, and planned data readouts for RYBREVANT in head and neck cancer and icotrokinra in ulcerative colitis as well as head to head data versus the TYK2 in psoriasis.In MedTech, we continue to make progress with clinical trials for our OTTAVA robotic surgical system and across our cardiovascular portfolio, including heart recovery with Impella ECP submission and circulatory restoration with Javelin and Shockwave E8 launches.This progress will bode well for financial performance for the balance of this decade. In fact, building on John's earlier discussion on our Innovative Medicine pipeline and what I just outlined I'd like to revisit and update a slide that we shared at our enterprise business review in late 2023.In that slide, you may recall we highlighted key assets in our portfolio that we expected to drive long term growth and projected higher revenue than Street estimates. We've been pleased to see that some estimates have been raised since the 2023 enterprise business review. And now I'd like to walk you through some of our current thinking on our pipeline potential to show where we see even more upside.Based on current 2027 Street estimates, our projections are at least 2 times higher for RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE, and at least 50% higher for SPRAVATO. One asset that we didn't highlight in this look back in 2023 was TREMFYA.However, given recent regulatory approvals for inflammatory bowel disease, we now see sales for TREMFYA at least 25% higher than current Street estimates. When looking ahead to 2028, we anticipate sales for our intravascular drug releasing system previously referred to as [TARIS] to be at least 3 times higher than current Street estimates, and new to the chart, icotrokinra, our targeted oral peptide to be at least 2 times higher.To be balanced, analyst estimates are still a bit more optimistic than our own estimates on nipocalimab in 2027. However, we do anticipate closing that gap after launch. We have even stronger conviction today in our growth opportunities than at the enterprise business review as we've reached new milestones with each of these medicines.And importantly, we expect all of these assets to achieve peak year sales beyond 2028 with further potential upside to Street estimates in the outer years. Even after considering risk adjustments for unapproved products that you may apply, hopefully, you'll also conclude there is additional value to your outlooks.In summary, it was a solid start to the year. Johnson & Johnson's diversified business model uniquely positions us to tackle the headwinds in 2025, deliver on our financial commitments, and advance our pipeline to create long term sustainable value for shareholders.Thank you. And with that, we are happy to take your questions. Kevin, will you please provide instructions for those seeking to participate in the Q&A. Operator (Operator Instructions) Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a nice quarter. Joe, you talked about $400 million in tariffs in the 2025 guidance or about $0.14 by our math. What is that on an annualized basis? And how are you thinking about being able to mitigate that over time? Can you pass along pass it along to customers? Or can you offset it by moving production? Thanks for taking the question. Joseph Wolk Yeah, thanks, Larry. Good to hear from you. So what's included in the $400 million, and again, that is primarily MedTech tariffs at this point. It's based on the programs that have been announced and the timing that correlates those programs.So that would be inclusive of Mexico and Canadian import tariffs that are not excluded out of USMCA. It will include to a very small degree, some of the steel and aluminum tariffs that impact some more products. It includes the China tariffs as well as the China retaliatory tariff. And that is probably the most substantial out of all the tariffs in terms of that $400 million.And so just maybe clarify for everybody that, that is products of US origin being shipped into China, and that's probably the most penalizing factor. That $400 million, I don't want to be cavalier about that. It's obviously -- the program has been phased in as a partial year. And then you have mostly this being captured as cost of goods.So it's going to sit on the balance sheet in inventory and be relieved through the P&L in future periods. So that's how we're thinking of it. In terms of mitigation strategies. I think you know across our entire business, we're very limited in terms of price leverage, whether it be on the MedTech side.There's contractual agreements already in place and certainly very much completed on the pharmaceutical side on current products that exist in terms of taking price increase. And I know Joaquin has a few thoughts regarding tariffs and maybe other mitigation factors and the supply nature of healthcare. Joaquin Duato Thank you, Joe, and thank you, Larry, for the question. Thinking about tariffs, I'm thinking specifically about pharmaceutical tariffs, there's a reason Larry why pharmaceutical tariffs are zero. It's because tariffs can create disruptions in the supply chain, leading to shortages.If what you want is to build manufacturing capacity in the US, both in MedTech and in pharmaceuticals, the most effective answer is not tariffs but tax policy. As a matter of fact, since President Trump 2017 tax reform, the investment in manufacturing, both in MedTech and in pharmaceuticals has significantly increased.And when you think about our recent announcement of investing $55 billion over the next four years at the completion of this investment plan, essentially all our advanced medicines that are used in the US will be manufactured in the US. So tax policy is a very effective tool to be able to build manufacturing capacity here in the US, both for MedTech and pharmaceuticals. Joseph Wolk Larry, I just want to follow up too. You did ask about a full year impact. And I would say like purposely ignored the question only because it would be way too speculative at this point. As we know, these tariffs are very fluid, and the responsible action for us now is to quantify what we see the impact in 2026, and then see what happens with respect to does it lend itself to negotiations with other countries and what's actually in place as we get into the later part of 2025. Operator Chris Schott, JPMorgan Chase & Company. Chris Schott Great, thanks so much. Just had a question on gross margins in the quarter. It seems like these came in well below recent trends. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of the drivers there. And just the outlook going forward as we consider mix, tariffs, et cetera, on the gross margin line? Thank you. Joseph Wolk Hey Chris, this is Joe. Thanks for the question. So I'd say it's -- there's a two part answer to this one. So specifically in the quarter, when looking at first quarter of 2024, we obviously had the impact of STELARA which was a much higher gross margin product than our average product in our portfolio. You had Part D, which is exclusively priced, which is eroding margin.And then you had some, I would say, transactional currency headwinds, one, a favorable impact last year or in 2023 funneling into 2024, and then some unfavorability from last year's currency action. I would expect moving forward based on some of the plans that we have, you could expect that 300 basis points to probably improve by a third to 50%, and that would be inclusive of the tariffs that I just mentioned in Larry's question.The other thing I would say is, I know you guys do a great job, but I think analysts were maybe a little bit optimistic with respect to their outlook for gross profit. Given that we had STELARA and Part D certainly communicated in the past, I believe the consensus was taking gross margins up year-over-year. And that one was probably a little bit of a miss. So we probably could have done a better job explaining it. Operator Asad Haider, Goldman Sachs. Asad Haider Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to the STELARA biosimilar version and the acceleration of the trajectory that we're going to see over the course of the year. Are you able to provide any quantitative framing on your views as it relates to the extent to which you think this erosion gets smoothed out by the transition to other brands like TREMFYA and other products? Thank you. Jennifer Taubert Well, good morning. Thanks so much for the question. It's Jennifer. So what we saw with STELARA in the first quarter was definitely in line with our expectations for the product for the year. And we continue to guide to the HUMIRA two year erosion curve once there were multiple biosimilars as really the best model there and make sure you are also including the additional impact of Part D redesign.If I could one additional point around STELARA, if we take a look at the business overall, it was highlighted that we had 4.2% growth across innovative medicine. That included a negative 810 basis point impact from STELARA.If you exclude that from our business, the remaining business, the bulk 90% of our business was actually growing over 12%, really demonstrating the strength of our overall business and with 11 key brands that were growing double digits. So yes, got the STELARA LOE, but the strength of the business is really coming through across all of our growth drivers. Joaquin Duato Yeah, and I would add to that. It is remarkable that in a year in which we are facing the headwind of the STELARA biosimilars, Part D redesign. We are able to grow even in the first quarter. and that we are able to do it like any other company to my knowledge in the healthcare industry has done it. Is a testament to the strength of our business, to the diversification of our growth platforms. And it gives me a strong belief that we are going to continue to deliver throughout the year. John Reed Joaquin and Jeff just building on the focus on STELARA, of course, STELARA begins to sunset TREMFYA continues to rise. You've seen the recent approvals in inflammatory viral disease where TREMFYA now is available as the only IL-23 class medicine for subcu delivery in both induction and maintenance.We have generated additional strong data going head-to-head against STELARA in a rigorous double-blind study, and showing the superiority across all mucosal endpoints. So that's really disease modifying healing. And then finally, I would say you'll see later this year, data in psoriatic arthritis, where we've done a rigorous study looking at preservation of joint avoiding the joint erosion that leads to long term disability.And what you'll see in those data when they're presented as a best in disease profile for TREMFYA in psoriatic arthritis. So really excited about the progress with TREMFYA, the world's first selective IL-23 inhibitor. Operator Danielle Antalffy, UBS. Danielle Antalffy Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Thanks so much to for all the color on tariffs and the ortho impact, that was super helpful. And Jeff, we're really going to miss you. But congrats and good luck in your next role. Just a quick question on -- and maybe this isn't really a question, I don't know, but I think it's still on the table and that do we or don't we go into a recession?And I'd love some color as much as you can provide on how you guys think about your business and how recession proof it is reason and what areas might be most at risk of underperforming relative to where we are today in a recession? Thanks so much. Joseph Wolk Hey Danielle, good to hear from you. Yeah, it's a good question. I think when we think about our business, the one thing we look to is certainly jobs reports in the US. And as of the most recent reports, it seemed to be pretty healthy. The reason we look at that is because it's a precursor as to who may have benefits and coverage prescription medications as well as procedures inclusive of elective procedures.We have seen in times past when there's been a little bit of a recession at some of those elective procedures maybe get delayed, but they don't get abandoned, and I'm thinking primarily within orthopedics. Healthcare overall has proven to be, while nothing is immune to a recession, it's been a little bit more recession proof than most other industries.And so we'll continue to monitor that. But right now, we feel good about the standards of care that we're elevating on both the innovative medicine and MedTech side of the house. Joaquin Duato Overall health care demand remains solid, and we feel good about the rest of the year regarding procedures and use of pharmaceuticals. I don't know any comments on that. Tim? Tim Schmid Sure. Further to Joe's point, Daniel, the category such as advanced IOLs is a good precursor to assessing the health of the economy. And so far, we haven't seen any impact on the performance of our IOL portfolio. In fact, we've seen the opposite.When you look at the performance of our IOL business on the back of the launch of both TECHNIS Odyssey here in the US and PureSee globally, we're seeing benchmark performances, and frankly, a turnaround of our performance here in the US with truly differentiated innovation. And so far, no major headwinds. Operator Terence Flynn, Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn Hi, good morning. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the question. Joe, we heard your comments this morning on the Section 232 potential pharma tariffs being focused more towards generics API versus the complex branded biologics. So just wondering if that's based on your impression of the most likely outcome here or that's more just your speculation or hope for the outcome. Thank you. Joaquin Duato Let me take that question, Terence, myself. So we are analyzing the Section 232. It was already announced previously. So it's something that we consider normal that is going to happen. And overall, adding to my comments on tariffs before, I think it's also important that companies in healthcare partner with the administration to look to mitigate some of the vulnerabilities that exist today in our healthcare supply chain so as to avoid any continuity of supply effect.So it's important for us to partner with the administration and with the government, and we plan to do it in this process to make sure that we have enough manufacturing capacity here in the US to be able to address multiple scenarios. Joseph Wolk And Terence, just to be clear, though, we want to be differential to the administration and their process, that is speculative just looking at the pharmaceutical landscape and where national security interest may reside and what products that those are delivered from. So that was really kind of our take on it, but we are working and engaging with the administration and being differential to their process. Operator Joanne Wuensch, Citibank. Joanne Wuensch Good morning, and thank you for taking the question and providing all of this information, very helpful. I do want to sort of just pause for a second on the orthopedic sales and try to unpack how much of that is which variable is there a way to quantify it? And how do we think about the recovery in the back half of the year and then into next year. Thank you. Tim Schmid Joanne, thank you for the question. And as we mentioned, we've tried to provide as much as possible to the significant impact of one timers in the quarter, which, to your point, have disproportionately impacted the Ortho business to the tune (inaudible) 480 basis points.There are three key drivers to that. Number one, the lapping of prior year change in walking implants revenue recognition, fewer selling days, and finally, revenue disruption from the recent ortho transformation, which we announced in 2023.So when you actually look at our operational growth when accounting for those, it would be closer to 2%. Now at the same time, I will say, Joanne, we're not satisfied. Our underlying performance was impacted by competitive pressures primarily in spine and sports, which is partially offset by strong NPIs and commercial execution in categories like trauma, shoulder and foot and ankle.What gives us confidence in continued acceleration to the back half of the year is the incredible impact of truly differentiated innovation across ortho portfolio. In fact, in 2024, we had 18 510(k) approvals here in the US and 45 outside of the US across our portfolio.And what gives us confidence is this combination of having best-in-class implants with truly differentiated enabled technology such as VELYS. In our hips portfolio, we believe we're going to see continued performance on the back of our focus on anterior approach, both with ACTIS, VELYS, KINCISE 2.0.In knees, we have seen a slowdown in revisions where I think you know we are historically number one, but feel very confident about continued momentum in primary with the combination of ATTUNE and VELYS, which is now available in 30 markets. We have 110,000 procedures.And as you probably know, we're now launching the VELYS (inaudible) in the coming quarters. In trauma, this was a standout quarter for us, close to 7.3% operational growth when you account for the one-timers, and this was driven by a tremendous uptake of our VOLT Plating System and the feedback we've got from surgeons, especially for our small frag menu frag, our distal radius has been exceptional. I think you also know that spine has been a bit of a laggard for us in the ortho portfolio.We are now effectively launching the trial to spine system, which is a thoracolumbar system, coupled with VELYS Spine also launching in the coming quarters. And so not the best start but strong confidence in improved performance for the remainder of the year in ortho. Operator Vamil Divan, Guggenheim Partners. Vamil Divan Great, thanks for taking the questions and for all the information. So I just wanted to maybe focus on that slide 29, Joe, that you touched about on this for you, Joe, or for Jennifer. I appreciate you sharing your perspectives on those products and how they differ your expectations are for consensus.There's three products that are not on there anymore that were there at the end of 2023, and that's CARVYKTI, TALVEY, and TECVAYLI. And I don't think the consensus expectations have changed for those very much since then.So maybe you can just talk about what has changed there why those aren't listed? Has there anything changed from your internal perspective or again externally that just had those come off of that list. Thank you. Jessica Moore Hi Vamil, this is Jess. Yes, you're absolutely correct. The multiple myeloma portfolio was on the slide during the EBR in 2023, and they are not on the slide today. Not saying that there is not still a disconnect, but it's just not to the extent of the other products on the list. At that time, we had estimated if you did the math on the slide, it would have been about $4 billion that would have been added to 2027.Around $2 billion was added. So those estimates did go up at that time. Again, not that there's not still a disconnect. It's just not to the extent of the others on the slide because those estimates were increased. Joseph Wolk So just to be super clear on that one, Vamil, we are still extremely bullish based on the clinical progression, R&D as well as the performance that we're seeing in the marketplace. I mean, look at CARVYKTI, I think, doubled sales year-on-year. So it's just a matter of that you guys took your numbers up. And so we agree, I guess, is maybe the best way to say that. Jennifer Taubert Maybe just to add in a little bit more on CARVYKTI. So yeah, over 100% operational growth in the first quarter, and we continue to make very strong share gains in that second line plus indication, we continue to add sites. We continue to add countries and capacity expansion globally.And so we have very firm conviction in CARVYKTI as a $5 billion plus asset and really are rolling that out globally very effectively at this point in time. So we don't see capacity as a constraint going forward based on the strength of the efforts that have taken place. And so we're full speed ahead for CARVYKTI going forward. John Reed And with the TEC and TAL, John here, we're really just getting started. You've probably seen some of the recent data where we've even combined those two molecules to achieve really unprecedented levels of complete responses.At the hematology meetings last year, we also showed combining either TEC or TAL with DARZALEX and demonstrating really impressive 100% minimal residual disease negativity in earlier lines of therapy and the opportunity, therefore, to really start bringing these first-in-class bispecific T cell redirecting molecules into earlier lines, even frontline in combination with our DARZALEX. So really enormous opportunity lies ahead of us with TEC and TAL. Jennifer Taubert And a couple of other things on TEC and TAL. So we continue to expand. We've got very good penetration in the academic settings right now, and we continue to expand out into the community. We've got very strong new patient starts. I know that the products have been plagued a little bit because the product is so effective with less frequent dosing.As we move forward, we should be lapping that soon. And really, you'll see the strength of those new patient starts and the continued expansion into the community we're starting to show through, combined then with what John talked about in terms of additional combinations and such, we've got very strong convictions, and we remain convinced on the opportunities for TEC and TAL. Operator Matt Miksic, Barclays. Matt Miksic Great, thanks so much for taking the questions, and I appreciate all the color. I had a clarification and a question if I could. So the question first. Would be great if you could maybe flush out the way that the opportunities in TREMFYA, which is now kind of leaning into (inaudible) and the emerging opportunities for icotrokinra in oral kind of -- and you see them coming together this year, next year, the year after as kind of a portfolio in immuno.And then clarification, if I could, just for Tim, it sounded like when you were describing the ortho impacts, you've got something like 2%. But if you look at the hip and knee math, I'm right, let's think about 2% US, I just want to make sure I understand.It sounded like your view was that's share, that's on else, and we're going to remedy that with the innovations and new products this year. Maybe just put to spine of a point on it, but like that's not market growth, like 2%, like you would say we're below market, and we should be doing better. Or do you think that that's kind of where the market's at is in, that like low single-digit range for US SMEs. Thanks so much. Apology for a long clarification, that will be super helpful. Thanks. Tim Schmid Matt, let me start with your question on ortho. And to be perfectly frank, while we have seen an improvement in our performance both in hips and knees through 2024, Q1 clearly wasn't our strongest quarter. And so we have seen competitive pressures. As you know, these are highly attractive categories within ortho, it's where the primarily fight is. And frankly we need to do better.And so we believe that our performance so far in the quarter was slightly below market. These are attractive markets. We've seen a strong robust procedures across ortho and we expect that to continue, as I mentioned, with the addition of our portfolio of both implants as well as enabling technology across hips and knees, we're confident that we will see an improvement through the remaining quarters. Thank you. Jennifer Taubert Right. So let's switch over to TREMFYA in immunology, and TREMFYA really had a great quarter in the first quarter with sales nearly $1 billion and over 20% operational growth. And this was really driven by market share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis as well as what we're seeing as it relates to the launch in ulcerative colitis and also in Crohn's disease.So we are really encouraged by the launch in both of these IBD indications. TREMFYA is now if we start with ulcerative colitis and how we're doing and then I'll go to Crohn's disease. So an ulcerative colitis TREMFYA is the fastest-growing product in the ulcerative colitis market.IL-23s are the fastest-growing class, and TREMFYA has already achieved nearly a 50% share of the IL-23 new patient starts in UC. So this is really based on the strength of the profile of the product and the strong differentiation that we have as a dual-acting IL-23, both impacting both IL-23 as well as CD64.The robust data that we have as it relates to efficacy and remission. And then as we get in to Crohn's disease and then later in ulcerative colitis as well, what we see is unrivaled simplicity with the opportunity for subcu induction as well as maintenance dosing.And when we take a look at market research data and intent to prescribe, the data comes through really strong that gastroenterologists really prefer TREMFYA over the IL-23 competitors based on those aspects that I just discussed. So efficacy, sustained remission, and mucosal healing right now for UC.On Crohn's, there is very significant enthusiasm around our launch there and it's really quickly getting traction. In the first few weeks since approval in Crohn's disease, patient initiation volumes are outpacing the other IL-23 launches in the market.And the polling (inaudible), our recent market research, 82% of gastroenterologists consider TREMFYA's induction dosing and flexibility to be a very positive differentiation in their treatment decisions, and they're seeing the efficacy profile to be quite compelling compared to the other therapies that are in the market. So we believe that in IBD, both in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's, we're off to a strong start.And as a reminder, tracking back to STELARA, STELARA 75% of sales were in IBD indications. We see no reason why TREMFYA wouldn't be the same or even better based on what we're seeing with the strength and competitiveness of the profile. John Reed Maybe just a comment on icotrokinra since you asked about that. The most proximal opportunity there is our psoriasis campaign where we will have altogether five Phase 3 studies, data for that this year, we expect to submit this year for psoriasis.We're so excited to be able to offer patients more choice with even a market like psoriasis, which should be well penetrated by now because it is a place where some of the biologics first got their start. More than half of patients who are eligible for an advanced therapy are still not on advanced therapy.And for many of these patients, it's really an aversion to the injections and going the biologics route. So to be able to offer patients a choice of a once-a-day pill to provide a solution for their disease, which has efficacy in the same ballpark as the biologics and with that well proven safety profile of IL-23 class is really exciting for us. Jennifer Taubert Yeah, we really believe that icotrokinra is a big market expansion opportunity to get in those earlier lines of therapy and to bring patients into therapies that have that strong biologic like efficacy. We think that there is a lot of room for both icotrokinra and TREMFYA in the market, and based on different patient needs, different physician needs as well. And so we think both of these are very important growth drivers for us going forward. Jessica Moore Thank you, Matt. Kevin, we have time for one last question. Operator Tim Anderson, Bank of America. Tim Anderson Thank you so much. Going back to tariffs, a big concern by investors is how that might ultimately wrap in transfer pricing structures? And every company I know is usually hesitant to talk about that. I'm wondering what J&J can offer up on that front that could include things like major products where you have transfer price structures in place as well as which geographies you have those in place as well. Joseph Wolk Yeah, I appreciate the question, Tim. It's just not something that for competitive reasons we're going to comment on. Joaquin Duato I would reiterate what I said before. With our $55 billion investment plan and the completion of that plan, which we spoke about four years, all our advanced medicines that are used in the US will be manufactured here in the US.So that's our plan, and that's why we believe it's important to provide this continuity. As I said before, after 2017 President Trump's tax reform, the level of investments the US have increased, and we plan to continue to increase it given the current tax regime or improvements that may come into the future. Jessica Moore Thank you, Tim, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions that you may have.As many of you have seen, Darren Snellgrove will be transitioning into the Investor Relations role starting May 1, as I transition into the Innovative Medicine CFO role. The last 3.5 years have been an absolute pleasure getting to engage with you all. I will now turn the call over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks. Joaquin Duato Thank you, Jess, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. As you heard, 2025, it's going to be a catalyst year for Johnson & Johnson.

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)beat first quarter earningsexpectations, but concerns over a $400 million tariff impact, mainly from China, are keeping shares flat. Yahoo Finance Senior ReporterAnjalee Khemlanijoins Market Domination to show how the company's medical device business is feeling the pressure. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. Johnson & Johnson tops first quarter earnings estimates, but the pharma company expecting a tariff impact on business. And Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani joins us now with the very latest, Anj. That's right, Josh. And we know that of course, tariffs are top of mind for the entire pharma sector as, we know, we heard the announcement from the administration yesterday about the specific pharmaceutical tariffs. Uh, Johnson & Johnson sort of bridges two gaps. It's it also sells medical devices and that includes to China. So that is where a lot of the impact comes from for the business. Just taking a quick look at the earnings, they did beat on both the revenue as well as earnings per share, but that doesn't seem to really have helped their stock. It's been trading largely flat, but, you know, slightly negative all day long. And that's because Wall Street is still waiting to hear about the final impacts. We took a look at what they said during the earnings call and they said they were expecting about $400 million in terms of impact and that's largely coming from those medical devices. I had a chance to catch up with CFO Joe Wolk earlier today and here's what he had to say specifically about where that $400 million is coming from. Take a listen. The tariffs that we've included in that 400 million relate to products that are not exempt under USMCA, some of the aluminum and steel tariffs that currently exist and apply to our MedTech products, and then the China tariffs, both, uh, uh, from China as well as the retaliatory, uh, tariffs that China had levied upon us. That last piece makes up probably about 70% of the total $400 million. So those are products of origin here in the US being shipped to China, and that's the impact that we we actually have. So we'll have to see with respect to pharmaceutical tariffs. So they're still waiting like the rest of the industry for the rest of the, you know, the other shoe to drop, essentially. And that's where things stand right now for, uh, for the medical devices. Uh, we've seen analyst notes all day talking about how they have less protection, uh, from China in particular, but also the Mexico, Canada, as you as they mentioned, or as he mentioned earlier, about the steel and aluminum there. Uh, looking at what's ahead and how to sort of, you know, wait for everything else to fall out for the year, I asked him how he's thinking about this, in particular how to, you know, run the company knowing that the the situation is still kind of fluid. And here's what Joe had to say. My only role, I guess, as CFO at this point would be to look at the profitability of business. If these tariffs continue to escalate, then you just have to make decisions like we would in any other part of our business. And we're currently doing within our orthopedics and surgery portfolio, rationalizing skews that are on the less profitable and perhaps even unprofitable side, in either certain markets or certain product portfolios. And that would be no different. So, as you can see, just looking at, uh, you know, rationalizing the business, and this is already impacting the company, the first of the major pharmaceuticals to report in this quarter. So we'll just have to wait and see how the rest stack up by comparison. All right, thank you, Anj. Appreciate it. J&J is projecting a $400m hit due to US tariffs in 2025, but reaffirmed its profit outlook while raising its sales forecast. Why investors should use the Zacks Earnings ESP tool to help find stocks that are poised to top quarterly earnings estimates. Stocks closed lower Tuesday, snapping a two-day rally as investor jitters returned to the fore. J&J faces several headwinds at the start of the year, including patent expiry, talc litigation, and, now, tariffs. Johnson & Johnson is holding its earnings outlook steady despite President Donald Trump signaling he could put tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry.

      "content": "J&J is projecting a $400m hit due to US tariffs in 2025, but reaffirmed its profit outlook while raising its sales forecast. Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine (J&J) addressed the potential impact of pharmaceutical tariffs during its Q1 2025 earnings call, as the US government intensifies its scrutiny of foreign drug supply chains. The company’s chief financial officer Joseph Wolk said the company expects a $400m cost tied to newly proposed and existing tariffs, with the largest burden stemming from China’s retaliatory duties on US-origin goods. With the possibility of pharma-specific tariffs looming and the Department of Commerce announcing the launch of a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceutical imports on 14 April, investors were watching closely for commentary from J&J on US trade policy. The investigation gives President Donald Trump 90 days to determine whether tariffs should be imposed on national security grounds. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more CEO Joaquin Duato said the company is analysing the Section 232 process, noting it had been anticipated and would be treated as a normal regulatory development. “It’s important that companies in healthcare partner with the administration to look to mitigate some of the vulnerabilities that exist today in our healthcare supply chain,” Duato said. “We plan to do it in this process to make sure that we have enough manufacturing capacity here in the US to be able to address multiple scenarios. We want to be deferential to the administration and their process,” he added. Many large pharma companies like MSD and Novartis have announced plans to increase manufacturing activity in the US against the backdrop of these tariff announcements, and J&Jannounced its own $55m US investmentin March 2025. “Since President Trump’s 2017 tax reform, the investment in manufacturing – both in medtech and in pharmaceuticals – has significantly increased. When you think about our recent announcement of investing $55bn over the next four years at the completion of this investment plan, essentially all our advanced medicines that are used in the US will be manufactured in the US,” said Duato. J&J indicated that most of the projected $400m tariff impact will affect itsMedtech division. The total includes duties from China, as well as import tariffs from Mexico and Canada not excluded under the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). Wolk noted that mitigation strategies are limited due to existing price controls and contractual agreements, particularly in the pharmaceutical segment. Tariff-related costs will primarily be recorded as inventory before impacting future profit and loss statements. Despite the headwinds, J&J posted Q1 results above analyst expectations. Revenue for the quarter rose by 2.4% to $21.9bn, with operational growth of 4.2% and adjusted operational growth of 3.3%. Oncology products, including multiple myeloma drug Darzalex (daratumumab), remained key contributors. The company raised its 2025 sales forecast by $700m to $92bn at the midpoint, reflecting the addition of Caplyta (lumateperone) following its$14.6bn acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies. However, J&J lowered its adjusted operational EPS growth projection to 6.2%, down from 8.7%, citing dilution from the acquisition. Adjusted reported EPS growth remains unchanged at 6.2%, consistent with guidance first issued in January 2025. J&J also reported regulatory approvals for two key therapies in 1Q: the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)cleared Tremfya (guselkumab)for Crohn’s disease, and theEuropean Commission (EC) approvedRybrevant (amivantamab-vmjw) for specific lung cancer indications. Medtech operational sales rose 4.1%, with growth driven by cardiovascular and general surgery segments. Orthopaedics showed weakness, particularly in spine and sports medicine. Legal challenges remain ongoing. In April 2025, a Texas court blocked J&J’s attempt to resolve talc-related liabilities via a bankruptcy filing by its subsidiary Red River Talc. J&J previouslyexpressed its intention to defend itselfagainst the claims, which it insists are “meritless” and “premised on junk science”. J&J intends to recover up to $7bn from legal reserves.

J&J faces several headwinds at the start of the year, including patent expiry, talc litigation, and, now, tariffs.

Futures edged down Tuesday morning, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow trading just below break-even, as investors braced for a flurry of corporate earnings. The muted open followed Monday’s tech-led rally, which briefly masked deeper market jitters tied to tariffs and macro uncertainty. Health care giant Johnson & Johnson expects about $400 million in tariff-related costs this year.  The costs will be felt primarily within the company's medical technology unit, which makes a range of medical devices and surgical products.

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported a beat on first quarter earnings Tuesday, even as concerns linger about how President Trump's tariffs will impact its medical device business, as well as how a probe into pharmaceutical tariffs will impact its business. J&J reported first quarter revenue of $21.9 billion, beating Wall Street estimates by 1.4%. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.69, beating Wall Street by 6.7%. Despite the beat, J&J's stock traded down less than 1% Tuesday. The company raised its 2025 sales guidance Tuesday by $700 million, putting the new target at 3.3% to 4.3% growth, or a midpoint of $92 billion. That is despite a decline in sales after the patent expiry of Stelara, the company's blockbuster inflammatory condition treatment, this year. On an earnings call Tuesday, executives said that China, Canada, and Mexico are where the company has the most exposure on tariffs. CFO Joe Wolk estimated about $400 million in tariff impact, saying it would primarily hit the medical devices business. \"It would include, to some small degree, some of the steel and aluminum tariffs that impact some of our products. It includes the China tariffs, as well as the China retaliatory tariffs — and that is probably the most substantial out of all the tariffs,\" Wolk said. He told Yahoo Finance that up to 70% of the tariff impact is from the products exported to China from the U.S. The hit from tariffs is being taken on as cost of goods and will \"sit on the balance sheet ... in future periods,\" Wolk said. Asad Haider, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research head of the healthcare business unit, told Yahoo Finance that the company reduced its research costs and also has a lot more leverage, due to its size, to whether the current tariff confusion. \"We don't really know line items...it speaks a little bit to the leverage they have across the P&L to make these types of investments,\" Haider said. The industry is also bracing for the impact of the investigation into pharmaceutical tariffs, which the Trump administration announced Monday. However, CEO Joaquin Duato said, \"It is also important that companies in healthcare partner with the administration to look to mitigate some of the vulnerabilities that exist today in our healthcare supply chain so as to avoid any continuity of supply effect.\" J&J has also faced some of the same industry pressures as its peers in recent years, including the Inflation Reduction Act's Medicare price negotiations. But it is also pressured by the ongoing talc litigation andrecently faced a major setback in the courts, with a judge rejecting a potential $10 billion settlement. J&J has since returned about $7 billion from the intended settlement amount back to the company's coffers and is pursuing a different legal avenue that should play out in the second half of the year, according to analysts. \"Although JNJ’s effort to resolve talc litigation through Red River Talc bankruptcy failed, the company will return to the tort system to challenge plaintiffs’ experts via Daubert motions. JNJ expects important Daubert hearings and rulings within 6 months (by the end of Oct 2025),\" wrote Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger in a note to clients Tuesday.

Release Date: April 15, 2025 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to thefull earnings call transcript. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) delivered strong operational sales growth of 4.2% in Q1 2025, despite headwinds from STELARA's loss of exclusivity. The company's Innovative Medicine sector achieved 4.2% operational sales growth, with 11 key brands growing double digits. MedTech sector showed 4.1% operational sales growth, driven by strong performance in cardiovascular businesses and surgical vision. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) announced a commitment to invest over $55 billion in the US over the next four years, enhancing manufacturing and R&D capabilities. The company increased its dividend for the 63rd consecutive year, reflecting its commitment to returning capital to shareholders. STELARA faced an approximate 810 basis points headwind due to biosimilar competition, impacting overall sales growth. Gross margins were below recent trends, affected by the loss of exclusivity for STELARA and Part D redesign. The orthopedic segment experienced a decline of 3.1%, impacted by competitive pressures and one-time events. Tariffs, particularly those related to China, are expected to have a significant impact on costs, with a $400 million impact anticipated in 2025. The company faces ongoing litigation challenges related to the Talc bankruptcy ruling, which could impact future financial performance. Q: Joe, you mentioned $400 million in tariffs in the 2025 guidance. What is that on an annualized basis, and how do you plan to mitigate it?A: Joseph Wolk, CFO, explained that the $400 million primarily involves MedTech tariffs, including those from Mexico, Canada, and China. The most significant impact comes from US-origin products shipped to China. Mitigation strategies are limited due to existing contractual agreements, but tax policy is seen as a more effective tool than tariffs for building US manufacturing capacity. Q: Can you explain the drivers behind the lower gross margins this quarter and the outlook going forward?A: Joseph Wolk, CFO, noted that the decline was due to the impact of STELARA's loss of exclusivity, Part D redesign, and unfavorable currency effects. He expects margins to improve by 100 to 150 basis points moving forward, despite the tariff impacts. Q: How do you see the erosion of STELARA being offset by other brands like TREMFYA?A: Jennifer Taubert, EVP, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine, stated that the impact of STELARA's loss was in line with expectations, and the business excluding STELARA grew over 12%. TREMFYA is gaining traction, especially with recent approvals in inflammatory bowel disease, and is expected to offset some of the erosion. Q: How recession-proof is Johnson & Johnson's business, and which areas might be most at risk?A: Joseph Wolk, CFO, mentioned that healthcare is generally more recession-proof than other industries. While elective procedures might be delayed, they are not abandoned. The company monitors job reports as an indicator of healthcare coverage and demand. Q: Can you provide more details on the orthopedic sales decline and the recovery outlook?A: Tim Schmid, EVP, Worldwide Chairman of MedTech, explained that the decline was due to one-time events like revenue recognition changes and fewer selling days. Despite competitive pressures, the company expects improved performance due to new product launches and commercial execution.

New economic data is out this morning, some of it reflecting conditions prior to our current tariff realities. We also see Q1 earnings results continue to ramp up, but we won’t have the spigots open completely til next week. Pre-markets are down somewhat, following a +3/4-percent gain on the Dow and the S&P 500, +2/3-percent gain for the Nasdaq. HeadlineImport Pricesfor last month have arrived, marking the first monthly negative since September of last year: -0.1%. This is down from the +0.1% estimate and the prior two months up +0.4%. Subtracting volatile fuel prices, an “unched” headline, 0.0%, is down -30 basis points (bps) from estimates and the previous month’s headline. Year over year, Import Prices reached +0.9%, 60 bps lower than the +1.5% anticipated by analysts and 110 bps lower month over month, from February. Keep in mind, this pricing was all conducted under the specter of a new tariff regime conditioning markets. It’s tough to know exactly how these numbers reflect this directly, but we expect to look back a few months and see clearly where tariff policy took hold. Exportsfor March were also “unched” month over month, but still +2.4% year over year. This is now the third straight month with Exports at or above +2% — the strongest such trend since the end of 2022, and again likely reflecting methods of exporters getting ahead of April tariffs. We do not expect such benign levels when these metrics report a month from now. The latestEmpire Statesurvey, tracking New York state manufacturing for the month of April, posted a negative headline number, -8.1, which was an improvement from the -10.0 estimate and -20.0 reported for March, which was the lowest performance rate since a year-ago January. The last positive Empire State headline was January of this year: +5.7. Bank of AmericaBAC is the latest of the big Wall Street commercial banks to report Q1 earnings, and the company posted its 11th-straight earnings beat: earnings of 90 cents per share outpaced the Zacks consensus of 81 cents by +11%. Revenues of $27.37 billion in the quarter surpassed expectations by +1.89%. Shares are up +2% in early trading, working down some of the -16% loss year to date. Pharmaceutical and household products makerJohnson & JohnsonJNJ outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines for its Q1 this morning, with earnings of $2.77 per share beating the Zacks consensus by 20 cents (and swinging to a profit year over year by 6 cents per share) on revenues of $21.89 billion — surpassing expectations by +1.26%. However, an unchanged earnings per share (EPS) guide for the full year is pulling shares down -1.5% in the news, after having grown +6% year to date Back to the banks,CitigroupC also posted solid beats in its Q1 report this morning, with earnings of $1.96 per share bettering estimates by 12 cents per share and +21% from year-ago numbers. Revenues of $21.6 billion was a step ahead of the $21.18 billion in the Zacks consensus. Expenses for the quarter fell by -5% to $13.4 billion. Shares are up +1% in the pre-market, cutting into the -10% loss year to date. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Zacks Investment Research While the top- and bottom-line numbers for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) give a sense of how the business performed in the quarter ended March 2025, it could be worth looking at how some of its key metrics compare to Wall Street estimates and year-ago values. Johnson & Johnson is holding its earnings outlook steady despite President Donald Trump signaling he could put tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry. The administration announced earlier it would conduct an investigation into drug imports. That move is widely seen as a first step toward imposing new levies. Earnings and revenue both beat estimates for the quarter. Johnson & Johnson CFO Joe Wolk joined Bloomberg Open Interest to talk about how tariffs could hit the industry and the drug maker's bottom line. J&J beats first-quarter earnings and sales estimates.

Johnson & Johnson forecasts about $400 million in costs this year related to tariffs on medical devices, said Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk in an interview.  Wolk said the estimated costs represent a \"worst-case scenario\" and take into account President Trump’s 90-day pause, China's retaliatory tariffs and the resumption of the U.S. tariffs.  J&J isn't doing anything differently yet in response to tariffs, Wolk added. ConocoPhillips (COP) closed at $86.45 in the latest trading session, marking a +0.07% move from the prior day.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s stock traders posted their highest quarterly revenue haul on record, riding a wave of volatility triggered by an emerging global trade war that's roiled financial markets. KBW Analyst of Large Cap Banks David Konrad has more on the story. Decent inflows and a decent rise in profits from deal exits are expected to have supported Blackstone's Q1 earnings. J&J is projecting a $400m hit due to US tariffs in 2025, but reaffirmed its profit outlook while raising its sales forecast. While J&J expects tariffs will cost it $400 million this year, the company maintained its earnings estimate and upped its sales guidance for 2025.

We recently published a list ofJim Cramer’s Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. On Friday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer outlined what investors should focus on in the week, especially pointing to earnings reports from major banks. “Rumor, innuendo, intrigue these are the stuff of great novels, of fabulous miniseries, riveting plays, and now they’re the stuff of the stock market.” READ ALSO:Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocksand10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently. He noted the chaotic nature of the current environment and remarked that “this tape has it all,” and emphasized how unpredictable developments from the White House have added to the turbulence. Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes. “Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,” he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, “Except this isn’t an eight-part blockbuster, it’s our money.” Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday’s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic. Cramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a “liberation day bottom,” a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, “Not sure, I’m just not sure.” He added: “Have you ever noticed the weekends don’t provide relaxation anymore because the president’s got advisors? He’s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He’s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime…. Monday’s trading, well, let’s just say that it looks like that it’s earning season so it’s gonna be even harder than usual.” For this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 113 Commenting on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) during the episode, Cramer said: “Tuesday, we hear from two more big banks and by this time, I gotta tell you, when we see the numbers from Bank of America and Citigroup, our eyes are going to glaze over. They shouldn’t but they will. I think that Bank of America will be the usual fine self and Citigroup’s gotten so loved that it’s probably going to roar no matter what is said, such is the admiration for CEO Jane Fraser and she certainly earned it.” Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is a long-standing financial institution. It offers services such as savings accounts, checking accounts, loans, investment management, and wealth planning. Hardman Johnston Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in itsQ4 2024 investor letter: “Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is the second largest bank in the developed world and operates the third largest branch network in the US. With 86% of revenues coming from the US, the bank is a clear beneficiary of the lower regulatory environment expected from the incoming administration. The company’s business is highly diversified across retail, commercial, wealth management, and investment banking, with significant scale across all verticals. Management believes there is a big opportunity going forward in growing and monetizing its mass retail client base. Wealth is another huge opportunity, with the Merrill Lynch platform enabling customers to make more transactions and purchase additional products. Lastly, Bank of America has an opportunity to increase efficiency through cost reduction and online banking. Our expectation is for the bank’s ROE to move significantly higher, driving EPS growth and higher multiples.” Overall, BACranks 3rdon our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of BAC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

John Lamparski / Getty Images Risks are mounting, but the economy is still in a good place, according to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan. Moynihan on the company's first-quarter earnings call Tuesday morning said the bank's research team \"does not currently believe we’ll see a recession in 2025,” though it has lowered its growth rate estimates for US gross domestic product. The bank doesn't expect the Fed to cut rates this year, he said. Bank of America (BAC)topped first-quarter earnings estimateson Tuesday. Other big banks have also reported better-than-expected results for the quarter when market volatility fueled big gains in trading revenue for many. Moynihan joined other big bank executives inexpressing some concernabout economic uncertainty. He noted that the odds of a recession had increased recently, but added it would be “a very slight recession, and we should fare well on that.” Moynihan pointed to healthy consumer spending and business data as reasons for optimism. Consumer spending, he said, continued to grow at a strong clip in the first quarterdespite concernsthat tariffs will force Americans to rein in their spending. Certain retailers may be seeing slower sales, he said, “but in the aggregate, the consumer keeps pushing money into the economy.” BofA’s business clients also ended the quarter on stable footing, according to Moynihan. “As we look at our business side and what our business clients are telling [us], in the current setting they remain profitable, liquid and have strong results,” he said."

Bank of America said its provision for credit loss was up by about $200 million from a year ago, but flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, an indication that the bank is not in panic mode.

Compare the return on your investments versus your student loan interest rate. BAC's Q1 earnings gain from solid equity trading income, higher NII and decent advisory and debt underwriting performance amid higher provisions and expenses. Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Alistair Borthwick said on a call with reporters Tuesday that the bank wasn't forecasting a recession.  Borthwick said clients are “looking for clarification” on the U.S. tax proposals, regulatory changes, and trade policy.  Views across Wall Street and in Washington diverge on whether the U.S. will slide into an economic recession. Merrill Lynch and Bank of America’s Private Bank posted a flat profit for the first quarter of 2025 amid a strong earnings beat for their parent company.  BofA’s  wealth unit reported net income of $1 billion in the first quarter, down 0.1% from the fourth quarter and nearly identical to the first quarter in 2024.  The wealth division reported total revenue of $6.02 billion for the first quarter, up nearly 8% from $5.59 billion a year ago as clients and assets under management both increased during the period. Citi plans to spend more in 2025 than it did last year on fixing long-running risk, data, and compliance deficiencies, as it carries out a yearslong turnaround plan that it refers to as its “transformation.”  Citi CFO Mark Mason said on a call with reporters that the firm is working to move away from manual activity and automate parts of its risk management processes and compliance programs.  Citi is prioritizing its efforts to try and change that. Citigroup (C) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of 6.52% and 1.95%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 2025. Do the numbers hold clues to what lies ahead for the stock? The headline numbers for Bank of America (BAC) give insight into how the company performed in the quarter ended March 2025, but it may be worthwhile to compare some of its key metrics to Wall Street estimates and the year-ago actuals. While the top- and bottom-line numbers for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) give a sense of how the business performed in the quarter ended March 2025, it could be worth looking at how some of its key metrics compare to Wall Street estimates and year-ago values. Johnson & Johnson stock fell alongside the broader market, despite beating first-quarter calls and hiking its 2025 sales guidance.

CEO Jane Fraser said the firm has \"real horsepower and firepower in our investment capabilities.\" Citi plans to spend more in 2025 than it did last year on fixing long-running risk, data, and compliance deficiencies, as it carries out a yearslong turnaround plan that it refers to as its “transformation.”  Citi CFO Mark Mason said on a call with reporters that the firm is working to move away from manual activity and automate parts of its risk management processes and compliance programs.  Citi is prioritizing its efforts to try and change that. Citi and Bank of America posted first-quarter net interest income of $14 billion and $14.4 billion, respectively.  Wall Street expected $14.49 billion of NII for the quarter at BofA, according to data compiled by FactSet, and $13.56 billion at Citi.

Stocks closed lower Tuesday, snapping a two-day rally as investor jitters returned to the fore. The S&P 500 slipped 0.22%, the Dow fell 0.36%, and the Nasdaq edged down 0.05%. Despite recent gains, all three major indices remain well below their pre-April 2 levels, when President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements first rattled markets. Read more:Wall Street banks are cashing in on trade war chaos. Auto stocks fell despite fresh rumors of a possible reprieve on tariffs. Ford, GM, and Rivian each ended the day lower, following a new forecast from S&P Global Ratings (SPGI) projecting a 700,000-unit drop in annual U.S. car sales if tariffs move ahead. “Affordability challenges and elevated interest rates are already pressuring demand,” analysts wrote. “Tariffs would only exacerbate those headwinds.” Tech and financial names led the upside among individual stocks. Palantir surged more than 6% following news that NATO finalized its purchase of the company’s AI-powered Maven Smart System. Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 5% amid ongoing activist investor pressure, and Netflix (NFLX) added nearly 5%. Bank of America and Citigroup also posted solid gains after beating first-quarter earnings expectations, fueled by strong trading revenue and consumer banking results. Investors are now looking ahead to fresh earnings from United Airlines (UAL) and The Trade Desk (TTD), both due after the bell, and to a Wednesday slate that includes Abbott Labs (ABT) and U.S. Bancorp (USB)—reports that should offer further insight into consumer health and the state of regional lending. Stocks opened higher Tuesday, with tech and bank names leading the charge as investors welcomed a morning packed with strong earnings and fresh deal buzz. Big banks were in rally mode: Citigroup, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs all ticked higher after posting better-than-expected results,fueled by strong trading revenues. Palantir Technologies jumped 4% after NATO finalized its purchase of the company’s AI-powered Maven Smart System — another boost for the defense-tech darling after Monday’s rally. Apple also edged higher, extending its 2% gain from Monday, which followed a surprise tariff exemption from the Trump administration. Meanwhile, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) caught a wave of investor enthusiasm after activist firm Elliott Investment Management revealed a $1.5 billion stake and backed the company’s newly announced strategic review. The broader market got a lift as chipmakers, software stocks, and AI plays rode the wave, with early signs pointing to a tech-led session and plenty of earnings drama still to come. Auto stocks gave back some of Monday’s gains, with Rivian (RIVN), Ford, and GM trading lower despite President Trump floating a potential delay in auto tariffs. “A US car with all US parts made in the US is a fictional tale,” analysts at Wedbush wrote, warning that the proposed tariffs — if not paused — could send the industry into “upside down mode” and trigger widespread supply-chain disruption. U.S. stock futures edged down Tuesday morning, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average trading just below the break-even line as investors braced fora flurry of corporate earnings. The subdued start followeda tech-driven rally on Monday, a temporary lift amid lingering concerns around tariffs andbroader economic uncertainty. Goldman Sachs (GS) kicked off the week’s earnings slate with a profit jump, even asCEO David Solomon warned of a “markedly different” environmentin the current quarter. Echoing Solomon’s sentiments, in March, hedge fundsunloadedglobal stocks at the fastest pace in over a decade — a sign that institutional investors may be growing more cautious as economic uncertainty deepens. Tuesday’s earnings lineup includes Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and Rent the Runway (RENT) before the bell, offering a pulse check across finance, healthcare, and consumer spending. Bank of America beat expectations in the first quarter, with EPS of $0.90 on $27.37 billion in revenue, lifted by a strong showing in its trading division. Like Goldman Sachs, the bank benefited from market volatility, which juiced results even as the broader economic outlook remains uncertain. Looking to Bank of America’s consumer banking division, revenue rose 3% to $10.5 billion, with combined credit and debit card spend hitting $228 billion — up 4% from a year ago. The bank added about 250,000 new consumer checking accounts, marking its 25th straight quarter of growth, and saw 4 billion digital logins, with 65% of sales now digitally enabled. Still, CEO Brian Moynihan struck a cautious tone, noting that “we potentially face a changing economy in the future.” Citigroup posted first-quarter 2025 net income of $4.1 billion, or $1.96 per share, on $21.6 billion in revenue — a 3% increase from a year ago. Growth was broad-based across all five core businesses, with standout performances in the markets and wealth divisions. U.S. personal banking revenue rose 2% to $5.2 billion, powered by gains in branded cards and retail banking, though partially offset by a drop in retail services. Net interest income climbed 6%, fueled by loan growth in branded cards and wider deposit spreads in its retail banking. Johnson & Johnson beat Wall Street expectations in the first quarter, reporting adjusted earnings per share of $2.77 on revenue of $21.89 billion. Sales of cancer drug Darzalex jumped 20% year over year to $3.24 billion, helping drive 4.2% growth in the company’s “innovative medicine” segment. The healthcare giant raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $91.6 billion and $92.4 billion, reflecting the impact of its Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition and the addition of Caplyta, a treatment for bipolar depression. However, adjusted EPS guidance held steady at $10.50 to $10.70 as the company factors in tariffs, deal-related costs, and currency headwinds. J&J also moved to reverse $7 billion previously set aside for talc-related legal settlements, after courts rejected its bankruptcy-based strategy for resolving lawsuits over its discontinued baby powder. The company maintains the claims are without merit and says it will defend them in state courts. During a television appearance on Monday, former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that Trump’s economic strategy is eroding global trust in U.S. financial assets, with volatility in Treasury yields reflecting broad investor unease. Treasury yields continued to climb on Tuesday, with the 10-year yield reaching 4.43%, as investors reacted to ongoing trade tensions and concerns over inflation. The bond market’s volatility has raised questions about the long-term stability of U.S. financial assets. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 added about 0.8% on Monday, while the Nasdaq climbed about 0.6%. All three indexes briefly slipped into the red before rebounding, buoyed by tech stocks after the Trump administrationissued a surprise tariff exemption. Apple (AAPL) stockgained more than 2%on Monday, while Palantir Technologies (PLTR) surged almost 5% following news that NATO had finalized itsMaven Smart Systempurchase. Auto stocks also ralliedMonday after President Donald Trump suggested his administration may offer tariff relief for automakers moving parts production. General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) each rose more than 3%, though no specifics were provided. For the latest news,Facebook,TwitterandInstagram.

Advertising giant hasn’t seen any specific instances of marketer clients pulling back thus far, executives say. Omnicom (OMC) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of 4.29% and 0.15%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 2025. Do the numbers hold clues to what lies ahead for the stock? While the top- and bottom-line numbers for Omnicom (OMC) give a sense of how the business performed in the quarter ended March 2025, it could be worth looking at how some of its key metrics compare to Wall Street estimates and year-ago values. Bank of America, Chevron, Stryker, Value Line and Sypris are included in this Analyst Blog. Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock has struggled since the technology company posted disappointing fiscal first-quarter earnings. Merrill Lynch and Bank of America’s Private Bank posted a flat profit for the first quarter of 2025 amid a strong earnings beat for their parent company.  BofA’s  wealth unit reported net income of $1 billion in the first quarter, down 0.1% from the fourth quarter and nearly identical to the first quarter in 2024.

Stock futures were falling Tuesday, with investors still trying to make sense of President Donald Trump’s ever-changing trade policies.  Stock futures were struggling for direction Tuesday, with investors fretting that tensions between the U.S. and China could escalate into a full-blown trade war after Beijing reportedly ordered airlines not to accept any more deliveries of Boeing jets.

Bank of America’s BAC first-quarter 2025 earnings of 90 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. The bottom line compared favorably with adjusted earnings of 83 cents in the prior-year quarter.BAC shares are up more than 3.5% in early trading in response to better-than-expected quarterly performance. Bank of America recorded an improvement in trading numbers for the 12th straight quarter. Sales and trading revenues (excluding net DVA) grew 9% to $5.65 billion, representing the highest number in a decade. Fixed-income trading fees increased 4.7%, while equity trading income jumped 16.7%. We had projected sales and trading revenues (excluding net DVA) of $4.85 billion.This, along with higher net interest income (NII), was the major revenue growth driver for Bank of America. NII grew on a year-over-year basis, driven by relatively lower deposit costs and fixed-rate asset repricing. Management projects NII to grow sequentially to almost $15.5-$15.7 billion by the fourth quarter end.On the other hand, total investment banking (IB) performance was subdued. The IB fees (in the Global Banking division) of $847 million were relatively stable as the plunge in equity underwriting income was almost offset by the improvement in advisory revenues and higher debt underwriting income.Further, provisions and non-interest expenses increased during the quarter.The company’s net income applicable to common shareholders grew 13.8% from the prior-year quarter to $7 billion. Our estimate for the same was $6.19 billion. (See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.) Net revenues were $27.37 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.86 billion. The top line also increased 6% from the prior-year quarter.NII (fully taxable-equivalent basis) grew 2.8% to $14.59 billion. Our estimate for NII was $14.55 billion. Net interest yield remained stable at 1.99%. We expected the metric to be 1.97%.Non-interest income increased 9.6% to $12.92 billion. This was driven by higher total fees and commissions. We had projected a non-interest income of $12 billion.Non-interest expenses were $17.77 billion, up 3.1%. The rise was due to higher revenue-related expenses and investments in people, technology, operations and brand. Our estimate for non-interest expenses was $17.63 billion.The efficiency ratio was 64.59%, down from 66.36% in the year-ago quarter. A fall in the efficiency ratio indicates an improvement in profitability. Provision for credit losses was $1.48 billion, up 12.2% from the prior-year quarter. We estimated the metric to be $1.18 billion.Net charge-offs declined 3.1% to $1.45 billion. As of March 31, 2025, non-performing loans and leases as a percentage of total loans were 0.55%, down 1 basis point. Book value per share as of March 31, 2025, was $36.39 compared with $33.71 a year ago. Tangible book value per share end was $27.12, up from $24.79.At the end of March 2025, the common equity tier 1 capital ratio (advanced approach) was 13.3%, compared with 13.4% as of March 31, 2024. In the reported quarter, the company repurchased shares worth $4.5 billion. Bank of America’s focus on digitizing and expanding operations, decent loan growth and relatively lower interest rates are likely to keep supporting growth. However, elevated expenses and funding costs and a challenging operating backdrop pose major headwinds.

Wells FargoWFC reported its first-quarter 2025 adjusted earnings per share of $1.27, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3%. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $1.26.Wells Fargo’s results benefited from a slight improvement in non-interest income and declines in provisions and non-interest expenses. However, the decrease in NII was an undermining factor.Solid trading performance, impressive growth in credit card and wholesale loans and decent IB performance droveJPMorgan’s JPM first-quarter 2025 earnings of $5.07 per share. The bottom line handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.62.Robust markets revenues, decent mortgage banking income performance and a rise in NII majorly supported JPMorgan’s quarterly numbers.

The recent robust earnings report from Bank of America, with net income reaching US$7.4 billion and EPS at US$0.90, not only contributed to a 3% rise in the share price last week but also aligns with the company's narrative surrounding organic loan and deposit growth, as well as digital strategy advancements.

With earnings expected to grow to US$31.7 billion by 2028, analysts have set a consensus price target of US$50.02, suggesting approximately 30% upside from the current share price of US$35.03. Despite the current price trailing behind the target, the emphasis on digital capabilities and client solutions, alongside measured strategies in wealth management and investment banking, fortifies the analysts' positive outlook, providing context for future growth potential.

Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) reported a strong net income of $7.4 billion and $0.90 in EPS for Q1 2025, marking an 11% increase in net income year-over-year. The company achieved a 6% revenue growth year-over-year, with net interest income growing by 3%. Deposits grew for the 7th consecutive quarter, reaching nearly $2 trillion, an 8% increase from mid-2023. The wealth management division added 7,200 net new households and saw net AUM flows of $24 billion in the quarter. The company maintained a strong balance sheet with over $200 billion in regulatory capital and nearly $1 trillion in liquidity, supporting client solutions effectively. Non-interest expenses increased to $17.8 billion, driven by seasonally elevated payroll taxes, litigation costs, and market-related expenses. Provision expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion, indicating ongoing caution in asset quality management. The company faces potential headwinds from expected interest rate cuts, which could impact net interest income growth in the future. There is uncertainty in the economic outlook due to market volatility and potential changes in tariffs and policies, which could affect loan demand and growth. The commercial loan growth, while strong, is subject to concerns over potential weakening in loan demand due to economic uncertainties and policy changes. Q: Given the uncertainty in the environment, what level of CET1 are you comfortable running with, and can the $4.5 billion buyback level be sustained?A: Alastair Borthwick, CFO: We ended the quarter with $7 billion in earnings, allowing us to increase the share buyback from $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion. We are growing into our capital by investing in the business, and we still have flexibility to increase the buyback. We don't have a specific CET1 target yet, as we await full clarity on capital requirements. Q: What drove the strength in loan and deposit growth in Q1, and what is the outlook for commercial loan growth given policy uncertainties?A: Brian Moynihan, CEO: We've been investing in building more commercial bankers globally, which is now paying off. Despite potential economic changes, our increased capacity and use of AI for efficiency are driving growth. We expect this to continue across the board. Q: What were the dynamics of setting the loan loss reserve this quarter, and how did you account for potential economic changes?A: Alastair Borthwick, CFO: We set reserves using data as of 3/31, with the ability to add judgmental layers. We use blue-chip economic indicators for baseline assumptions, which have moved down in terms of economic growth. Our reserve is set closer to an unemployment rate of around 6% for 2025-2026. Q: How are you managing expenses, and is the full-year expense growth expectation of 2% to 3% still valid?A: Alastair Borthwick, CFO: Yes, we still expect full-year expenses to grow 2% to 3%. It might be towards the higher end, but it depends on fee developments throughout the year. Q: How do you view the impact of potential rate cuts on your net interest income (NII) targets?A: Alastair Borthwick, CFO: We expect to maintain our Q4 NII target despite four anticipated rate cuts. The cuts are expected later in the year, so they won't significantly impact 2025 but may pose a headwind in 2026. Our long-term target remains a 2.3% NIM.

NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge has ordered Bank of America (BAC) to pay more than $540 million to resolve long-running litigation from a U.S. regulator that alleged the company underpaid mandatory assessments for deposit insurance. The order, reached March 31 and published publicly on Monday, arrives over eight years after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation sued Bank of America in 2017. “We are pleased the judge has ruled and have reserves reflecting the decision,” Bank of America said in a statement to The Associated Press. The FDIC declined to comment when reached Tuesday. Back in 2017, the FDIC accused Bank of America of refusing to pay over $500 million in assessments — a figure it later expanded to $1.12 billion — alleging that the banking giant failed to honor a 2011 regulatory rule and “unjustly enriched itself” at the FDIC’s expense. The Bank of America later filed a motion to dismiss in part, strongly denying it acted with an intent to evade such payments. It also argued that some of quarters the FDIC targeted for assessments fell outside the statue of limitations. After a yearslong legal battle, U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan in Washington, D.C. partially granted and denied motions for both Bank of America and the FDIC. She said that the nearly $540.3 million payment from Bank of America would cover its underpaid assessments spanning from the second quarter of 2013 through the end of 2014's fiscal year, plus interest — but ruled that the FDIC waited too long to sue over earlier claims. Formed in 1933 during the Great Depression, the FDIC is one of several banking system regulators today. The agency isbest known forrunning the nation’s deposit insurance program, which insures Americans’ deposits up to $250,000 in case their bank fails. Bank of America, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, is the second-largest bank by assets in the U.S. On Tuesday, the company reported a first-quarter profit of $7.4 billion and $27.37 billion in revenue net of interest expense, topping Wall Street expectations.

Bank of America (BAC) and Citi (C) beat expectations with strong first quarter results, boosting investor confidence and lifting both stocks. RBC Capital Markets bank analyst Gerard Cassidy joins Market Domination to break down what's driving bank earnings. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. Bank of America and Citi reporting first quarter earnings this morning, beating on the top and bottom lines and following a trend of strong Q1 bank earnings. For more, we're bringing in now Gerard Cassidy, analyst at RBC Capital markets, covering the banking sector. Gerard, it's great to see you as always. So, listen, the bank earnings they continue to roll in, Gerard. We heard from Bank of America and Citi this morning. Investors clearly like what they heard there. Both those stocks are higher in today's trade. Broadly, how would you characterize what we've heard, Gerard, from the sector you know so well? I mean, it has seemed generally positive, Gerard. Josh, you're absolutely right. The results have been good. Um, the banks have generally beaten all of our estimates on the street consensus EPS estimates as well as my own. And I think part of the reason is of course, the capital markets businesses for the large money center banks and for Goldman and Morgan Stanley were really strong in trading, particularly equity trading. So that was a large reason for the beats from most of these companies. Also credit. Credit remains very resilient even though they're building up reserves as they're required to do under the new accounting standard called CECL, current expected credit losses. When I say new, it's January of 2020 when it was introduced. So I think what we're seeing is that you know, the first quarter of course had two months of no commentary about tariffs. It was only in March that the commentary started to be elevated. And April of course has been very volatile. So I think what we're seeing is first quarter results overall are better than expected. Credits strong. Capital levels are very healthy. Liquidity is high. It's really the future and the unknown of the future that has everybody on edge. How long do you think the elevated volatility, that the trading volume that comes from that, can make up for muted deal activity? Can that continue for a couple of quarters or is there a limit to how far that could take you? It's a really good question because it was outstanding in the first quarter and it did more than offset, you know, the lower, the lower numbers in some of the selected investment banking categories, particularly ECM, equity capital markets. The IPO market has really kind of fizzled out here due to this volatility. So you really need volatility and volumes to go with it to enable these larger firms to offset any slowdown in activity and advisory, which is M&A activity of course, and then the ECM business. Um, the DCM, debt capital markets had a very strong first couple of months of the year. It has slowed down a little bit. So you're right, we will need to see elevated volumes and volatility if the investment banking markets don't come back. Ideally, if we could have some resiliency in the markets and less volatility, you might get a combination of lower revenues and trading, but more than offset by incremental pickup in the advisory and the ECM business. So we'll have to see how that plays out, but right now the uncertainty is really weighing on the ECM and advisory business at this time. The purchases are a sign of confidence despite growing concern about an economic slowdown this year. Wall Street is raking in even more money from trading than it did during the market’s Covid-19 era swings.  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley all said a surge in trading revenue helped lift their profits last quarter and beat expectations. Goldman's Chief China Equity Strategist Kinger Lau explains how to navigate market volatility and the delisting risks for Chinese companies. He also says Goldman is betting on sectors that stand to benefit from Beijing's stimulus measures. Lau was speaking on Bloomberg's The China Show. Citi plans to spend more in 2025 than it did last year on fixing long-running risk, data, and compliance deficiencies, as it carries out a yearslong turnaround plan that it refers to as its “transformation.”  Citi CFO Mark Mason said on a call with reporters that the firm is working to move away from manual activity and automate parts of its risk management processes and compliance programs.  Citi is prioritizing its efforts to try and change that. Barclays Bank offers high-yield online savings accounts and CDs.

Big banks are offering the latest view of how their customers are faring amid President Trump's tariff turmoil, andit's not all bad— at least for now. \"The message has really been that the sky is not falling,\" Saul Martinez, a bank analyst for HSBC, told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. Five of the country's largest banks over the past week posted first quarter rises in profits and revenue, driven in part by trading operations that benefited from the market volatility triggered by the initial rollout of Trump's first tariffs in February and March. Read more:The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Collectively, net profits at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Goldman Sachs (GS) amounted to $35 billion, a 13% increase from the year-ago quarter. Revenue also rose at all of these banks. Trading revenue alone jumped 17% to more than $36 billion. Many banks said their consumer customers were still spending, defaults were still manageable, and businesses were not experiencing distress despite the uncertainty about the months ahead. None of the institutions with big Wall Street footprints updated their earnings outlooks for the rest of the year, either. What these results didn't include, however, was the volatile period that followed Trump's April 2 \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement, which took place two days after the quarter ended. Stocks and bonds plunged and have yet to fully recover, ushering in new uncertainty about the economy and the safety of US assets. \"We're surprised about the degree of ongoing firmwide strength at all 5 big banks ... and the more than expected upbeat views,\" said Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo in a Tuesday note. \"To us, it all says that events since Apr 2 can still be little more than a speed bump, so long as policy moves faster to help ease most of the uncertainty,\" he added, in reference to promised deregulation of the banking industry expected from the Trump administration. Not that banks and their top executives were entirely upbeat. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said that the prospect of a recession \"has increased.\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the economy faces \"considerable turbulence,\" with a recession as a \"likely outcome.\" In such a scenario, he added, \"earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down.\" But many bankers were noticeably more optimistic. The word \"recession\" did not come up once on Citigroup's Tuesday earnings calls with analysts. Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, also offered an optimistic vision of the current turmoil. \"When all is said and done, and longstanding trade imbalances and other structural shifts are behind us, the U.S. will still be the world's leading economy,\" she said in a statement with the bank's Tuesday earnings release. Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America,went out of his way on Tuesdayto note that his bank's research team doesn't see a recession happening in 2025. Read more:What is a recession, and how does it impact you? US consumers, he added, keep \"pushing money into the economy,\" and the lender's business clients \"remain profitable, liquid and have strong results.\" But \"nobody has a perfect crystal ball,\" Moynihan acknowledged, noting that \"we potentially face a changing economy in the future.\" Some banks even showed a rise in investment banking income during the first quarter, defying predictions of a slowdown. Executives acknowledged some deals were now on hold due to uncertainties, but many described the pullbacks as temporary rather than long-lasting. \"I'm saying pause versus delete,\" Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick told analysts of the current investment banking environment. \"We don't know whether the economy is going to contract.\" Even amid the optimism, there were signs that banks are preparing for harder times. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo (WFC) added $8.4 billion in provisions to account for future loan losses. The figure was 29% higher than the year-ago period and 9% higher than the previous quarter. \"We're still in a cloudy period. It's going to be choppy from here, and it's exhausting,” Ken Leon, an analyst for CFRA Research, told Yahoo Finance.

A Texas judge on Tuesday threw out a federal rule that would have capped credit card late fees after officials with President Donald Trump's administration and a coalition of major banking groups agreed that the rule was illegal.  The ruling by U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman in Fort Worth came a day after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a collection of major industry groups that had filed a lawsuit last year to stop the rule announced they had come to an agreement to throw out the rule.

The Asian nation ordered airlines not to take further deliveries of Boeing Co. jets, according to people familiar with the matter. Meantime, the European Union and US made scant progress bridging trade differences. “We would advise investors to avoid making hard and fast assumptions about how tariff developments will ultimately play out in the economy and on corporate profits,” said Anthony Saglimbene at Ameriprise. “Instead, we suggest investors prepare for a range of possible intermediate-term outcomes that include slow-to-positive economic and profit growth, and scenarios of slow-to-negative growth.” High uncertainty surrounding US trade policy and a spike in financial-market volatility has unsettled global investors over the past few weeks.

The market’s third borrower Tuesday, Japanese financial firm Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., priced $3 billion of notes. The longest portion of Wells’ offering, an 11-year security, yields 1.28 percentage point above Treasuries, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified as the details are private. Goldman’s longest portion, a six-year tranche, yields 1.25 percentage point above Treasuries, a separate person said. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Lead $16.5 Billion Bank Borrowing Spree It’s common for the biggest US banks to sell debt shortly after releasing quarterly results. But there were some questions this go-around after the primary market froze earlier this month in the wake of an evolving global trade war. Tuesday’s deals received orders 3.3 times the amount of bonds sold, according to Bloomberg’s Brian Smith, compared with 3.8 times on Monday. “Clearly there’s appetite for sizable bank issuances,” said Peter Simon, an analyst who covers the sector at research firm CreditSights. “We don’t see much evidence that the market is overly concerned with these banks, which makes sense given their results have been solid this quarter.” Goldman reported record revenue in the first quarter, while Wells Fargo’s report pointed to soft loan demand amid the ongoing tariff uncertainty. Wells’ net interest income, the difference between what it makes from lending and pays for deposits, fell short of analysts’ projections. Still, non-interest expenses were better than forecast as Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf works to cut costs. In the high-grade market, banks have underperformed in recent weeks, with TD Securities credit strategist Hans Mikkelsen writing that was likely due to expectations of new debt sales. The average bank bond spread widened 24 basis points this month through Monday, more than investment-grade notes overall while yields for the latter briefly hit 11-month highs last week. That has lured yield buyers into the market, setting things up well to digest the banks’ debt sales, said Samuel Wilson, a portfolio manager at Voya Investment Management. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. are candidates to issue debt after they released first-quarter results Tuesday. Coming into earnings season, JPMorgan strategists Kabir Caprihan and Vincent Barretta predicted the six big US banks could might issue about $32 billion of bonds. That compares with an average $23 billion this time each year from 2014 through 2024. The four deals completed so far have raised $28 billion. (Updates throughout.)

Rio Tinto on Wednesday reported its lowest first-quarter iron ore shipments since 2019 and warned that more weather disruptions could lead to a 2025 forecast miss, after cyclones impacted the miner's Pilbara operations.  The company now expects Pilbara iron ore shipments for 2025 to hit the lower end of its forecast range of 323 million to 338 million metric tons.  A series of tropical cyclones in the first quarter snarled activities at the Dampier port in the Pilbara region, with the company previously warning of total losses of 13 million tons of iron ore due to bad weather.

The rapid rise of ultra-fast fashion retailer Shein has been so key to the fortunes of a group of urban villages on the outskirts of China's southern metropolis of Guangzhou that they have been colloquially dubbed \"Shein villages\".  Shein was able to become a behemoth selling over $30 billion worth of goods annually on a foundation of cheap prices and advantageous trade rules, such as the U.S. \"de minimis\" exemption that allows low-cost imports to enter the country duty-free.  But the supply chain efficiencies emanating from hundreds of humming factory floors in these villages, reacting in real-time to online orders for leopard print palazzo pants or peasant blouses at unbeatable prices, were also key to its success.

President Donald Trump's trade war has increased the odds of an economic recession, hitting business and consumer confidence and rattling global markets.  United said its financial forecast is dependent on the macro environment, which, it added, is \"impossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence.\" Speaking on the company’s earnings call, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon said in part: “I would I would say the level of uncertainty is up significantly and it’s partially up because growth was slowing down before we got to the implementation of trade policy” and the implementation of trade policy reset the prospect of forward growth “pretty significantly all over the world.” Solomon added: “I would say that when you get outside of the U.S. and I listened to CEOs, I hear a greater sense of Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results Sign in to access your portfolio Try again."

      "content": "Let Social Media Today’s free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox.  TikTok’s taking another step towards expanding its in-stream business listings, with the addition ofbusiness reviewson selected, location-tagged videos in the app. As you can see inthis example, posted by app researcherJonah Manzano, some TikTok comment sections now also have a separate “Reviews” tab, which showcases user reviews for businesses at the tagged location. Some of these are for general locations and tourist attractions, while others are for specific businesses, with viewers able to upvote each review direct in-stream. You can also tap through on any review to be taken to the reviewers’ TikTok profile. As reported byTechCrunch, the addition seemingly builds on TikTok’s effort to compete with Google on Search. Over time, TikTok has become a much bigger source of discovery, with young users turning to the app to research all sorts of products and experiences via direct creator insight. Indeed,back in 2022, a Google executive noted that“almost 40% of young people, when they’re looking for a place for lunch, they don’t go to Google Maps or Search, they go to TikTok or Instagram.” Google still remains the key destination for discovery, but TikTok is undeniably gaining more traction in this respect, which Google had seemingly been looking to tap intovia a similar integration at one stage. As you can see in this example, TikTok has also tested similar review and business info displays powered by Google Maps, though this latest variation no longer has the Google branding, which suggests that TikTok is now going it alone on this element. Maybe Google decided to nix that project, or maybe TikTok felt that it was better to build its own database. Which could also better align the app with another development in its broader in-stream shopping push. In-app shopping is where the Chinese version of TikTok nowgenerates the vast majority of its income, and it’s been trying to implement the same in Western markets, and it is steadily gaining traction on in-app sales. But then again, in the U.S. market, it’s about to take a significant hit. Many of TikTok’s current item listings are for products sourced from China, and as such, Trump’s tariffs are about to boost the prices of these items by a lot. Which means that TikTok will probably need to look elsewhere to maintain its momentum for in-stream purchases. And services listings, including food delivery, could be the next element it integrates. It already offers services in the Chinese version of the app, expanding the range of ways in which users can spend. More money flowing through the app means more opportunity for expanded sales, and it could be that these new review listings will help to drive more interest in its eventual in-app services listings. Either way, it’s an interesting addition, which could help to improve the utility of the app. TikTok’s review listings are available for videos tagged in a limited number of locations at this stage.

      "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Anthropic announced on Tuesday that its AI chatbot, Claude, now integrates with Google Workspace, allowing it to search and reference your emails in Gmail, scheduled events in Google Calendar, and documents in Google Docs. The integration is rolling out in beta first to subscribers to Anthropic’s Max, Team, Enterprise, and Pro plans. Administrators managing multi-user accounts must enable the integration on their end before users can connect their Google Workspace and Claude accounts, according to Anthropic. Google DeepMind’sGemini chatbot also integrates with Workspace, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT integrates with Google Drive. However, Anthropic is one of the first third-party AI companies to offer a way to closely connect to Google’s productivity suite. Anthropic’s team-up with Google aims to give Claude more personally tailored responses without requiring users to repeatedly upload files or craft detailed prompts. OpenAI and Google have tried achieving the same effect via different approaches, such as addingmemory featuresthat allow chatbots to reference past conversations in their replies. In a press release, Anthropic says Claude’s new integration can help users organize their professional and personal lives. For example, Anthropic claims the feature can assist parents by scanning “emails and calendar events to highlight important commitments, while searching the web for updated school calendars, local community events, and weather forecasts that might affect family plans.” Claude will provide in-line citations when it references Workspace content, showing users exactly where specific information originated, says Anthropic. While the integration doesn’t give Claude the ability to schedule calendar events or send emails, it may raise security concerns among some users. It’s unclear how extensively Claude will search through a person’s Google Workspace, or whether users have to direct Claude to look at a particular email or calendar event depending on the nature of their request. It’s also not clear whether users can ask Claude not to search across certain sensitive emails or files. Responding to the above, an Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company doesn’t train models on user data by default and has implemented “strict authentication and access control mechanisms” for external services like Workspace. “Each user or organization’s connections to external services (like Google Drive, Gmail, etc.) are properly authenticated and authorized for only that specific user or organization,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “Claude doesn’t have the ability to access or transfer data between different users’ connected services, as each connection is bound to the specific authentication credentials of that individual user or organization.” Anthropic also announced on Tuesday the launch of Claude Research, a new feature that conducts multiple web searches to generate detailed answers. Positioned as a competitor to OpenAI and Google’s “deep research” agents, Claude Research offers an “optimal tradeoff” between speed and comprehensiveness, Anthropic says. Claude Research typically runs for less than a minute to compile info, according to an Anthropic spokesperson — faster than some rival deep research agents. However, Claude Research doesn’t use a custom model, instead leveraging Claude’s recently launched web search capabilities. The company is rolling out Claude Research to subscribers to its Max, Team, and Enterprise plans in the United States, Japan, and Brazil. It’ll come to Pro customers soon, Anthropic says. These updates are part of Anthropic’s broader effort to attract users to its AI subscription plans with features that make Claude more capable and useful. WhileClaude is growing in popularity, reaching 3.3 million web users in March, according to data compiled by SimilarWeb, Anthropic’s user base is still dwarfed by ChatGPT’s.

      "content": "Let Social Media Today’s free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox.  Creating passable video content via AI is becoming more viable, which, given the popularity of video across all social apps, could be a massive help for digital marketers. Though it does come with some risks. Today, Google has announcedexpanded access to its Veo 2 AI video generation model, which can generate 8 second clips from text prompts. As you can see in these examples, Veo 2 outputs short video clips from simple descriptions, which you can then download in720p resolution, as an MP4 file in 16:9 landscape format. As explained byGoogle: “Starting today, Gemini Advanced users can generate and share videos using our state-of-the-art video model,Veo 2. In Gemini, you can now translate text-based prompts into dynamic videos. Google Labs is also making Veo 2 available throughWhisk, a generative AI experiment that allows you to create new images using both text and image prompts, and now animate them into videos.” Veo 2’s outputs look impressive, with (Google says) improved systematic understanding of real-world physics and human motion. The risk, however, is that they don’t all look so great, with some AI generated video still standing out with its overly polished, contorted, unrealistic depictions. Google’s obviously working to rectify this, but that is another consideration in using AI generated content, that you need to be aware of systematic confusion in display. In addition to Veo 2, Google’s also adding video animation to your visual creations inWhisk, which creates graphic depictions of described scenes. The same as Veo 2, these animations are only short (8 seconds long), but it adds another element to these visual explorations, which could provide an additional avenue to creating new, copyright-free, video clips. This is the next stage of AI visual generation, with video creation being the next big barrier that all the major AI projects are working to perfect. Many see this as a means to (eventually) enable full movie production via AI, which will democratize creative outputs. Though the story, of course, remains the central hook. That’s the same in any narrative-aligned content that you create, whether it’s 8 seconds or longer, that the concept itself also has to resonate in order to generate a truly resonant video piece. Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the Social Media Today free daily newsletter But at the same time, if you’re just looking to animate your ads to tap into the broader popularity of video content, tools like Veo could also be a powerful complement within your digital marketing toolset. Either way, Veo represents the latest advances on this front, and it could be worth checking out to get a better handle on what’s possible. Google says that video generation is now rolling out to Gemini Advanced subscribers globally on web and mobile, starting today and continuing over the next few weeks.

Japan's Fair Trade Commission has ordered Google, a unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), to cease certain business practices deemed anticompetitive under the nation's Antimonopoly Act. The watchdog announced the order on Tuesday, stating that Google breached regulations tied to unfair trade behavior. The agency initially opened its investigation on October 23, 2023, and noted it coordinated with foreign regulators conducting similar probes into the company. At the core of the inquiry was Google's arrangement with Android smartphone manufacturers. The company allegedly mandated that its search engine be given priority placement on mobile devices. This included requirements to preinstall Google Search and Chrome, along with placing their icons on the default home screen. Manufacturers were reportedly also restricted from altering Chrome's default search settings. Additionally, the commission alleged Google provided financial incentives to manufacturers, offering ad revenue shares in return for not preloading competing search services. These agreements were said to ensure Google maintained dominance across general search functionalities. Google has not yet commented publicly on the matter. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.

The new feature, which appears to be a test, eliminates the need to conduct a new search or open Google when you come across a place on TikTok and want to learn more about it. TikTok users who have access to this new feature will see a new “Reviews” tab on the right after they click to view the video’s comments. For instance, if you come across a video of Central Park in New York City where the creator has tagged the location, you’ll be able to see users’ star ratings for the location, their written reviews, and their uploaded photos, if any. You can also click on a reviewer’s username to visit their TikTok profile from this section, which differentiates this feature froman earlier Google Maps integration,which was designated witha Google Maps icon. Although the new feature may be a welcome addition for some, others may think it crowds the user experience when viewing content. The move is the latest way that TikTok is looking to expand its search ambitions to take on Google. In 2022, a Googleexecutive suggested that TikTokwas eating into its core services, Search and Maps, particularly for younger users. Fast-forward to today, and TikTok has challenged Google’s dominance in several areas. In addition to becoming a top stop forplace searches among Gen Z, TikTokadded image search capabilitieslast year that allow users to take or upload a photo to find similar products in TikTok Shop. In September 2024, TikTok also began allowing advertisers to target its search results page through“TikTok Search Ads Campaigns,”a keyword-based search solution designed to display brands’ ads in search results. It’s unclear if TikTok plans to roll out its reviews tab more broadly, as the company declined to provide comment ahead of publication. However, in TechCrunch’s tests, we found that only some videos with a tagged location would showcase the feature. Topics Consumer News Reporter Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

The expansion comes as Google looks to deliver an answer to OpenAI’s Sora video generation platform, and as competition in the space grows fiercer. Two weeks ago, one of the more formidable synthetic media companies, Runway, released thefourth generation of its video generatorandraised more than $300 millionin new capital.

Veo 2-generated videos can also be downloaded as MP4 files, watermarked with Google’s SynthID tech. There’s a limit to how many videos users can create each month, and the Google Workspace business and education plans aren’t supported at the moment, the company says. Google is also integrating Veo 2 with Whisk, an experimental feature in Google Labs that lets you use images as prompts with Gemini to create new images. A new feature, Whisk Animate, lets users take images they’ve generated and turn them into eight-second, Veo 2-generated videos. (Google Labs is Google’s platform for early-stage AI products, gated behind the company’s $20-per-month Google One AI Premium subscription.)

GOOGL dominates the digital advertising and search domains that generate significant advertising revenues, hitting $264.59 billion in 2024. Google Cloud revenues surged 30% year over year to $12 billion in 2024, driven by core cloud products, AI infrastructure, and Generative AI (GenAI) tools like Vertex AI and Gemini. GOOGL’s plan to buy Wiz for a whopping $32 billion will enhance Google Cloud’s security offerings, driving further growth.Meanwhile, Alphabet’s autonomous driving platform, Waymo, is now expanding to Japan in collaboration with GO, a leading Japanese taxi platform, and Nihon Kotsu, Tokyo's largest taxi company. The Waymo service is already available in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, with more than four million fully autonomous rides in 2024 alone. GOOGL is expanding Waymo services to Austin and Atlanta on the Uber app this year. In partnership with Moove, Waymo will be available to Miami in 2026. Waymo One app will be available to Washington D.C. riders in 2026.Will these factors drive Alphabet’s prospects this year? Alphabet shares have declined 16% year to date due to challenging macroeconomic conditions post U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to levy tariffs on trade partners, including China, Mexico and Canada. Sluggish cloud growth and higher investments on developing cloud infrastructure is a headwind for Alphabet stock.  Image Source: Zacks Investment Research  GOOGL is suffering from a lack of capacity, and until new capacity comes online in 2025, cloud revenues are expected to see increased variability. The company expects to invest roughly $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, which is aimed at building up technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking.So, what should investors do with GOOGL stock? Let’s find out. At its Cloud Next 2025 conference in Las Vegas, GOOGL unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), expected to be available later this year. Google Cloud unveiled its Cloud Wide Area Network (Cloud WAN), giving enterprises access to its private global fiber network. Alphabet showcased Willow, its new quantum chip while on the AI model front, Alphabet launched Gemini 2.5, its most advanced reasoning model, alongside Gemini 2.5 Flash, a low-latency, cost-efficient version tailored for developers.Alphabet’s initiatives to deploy AI and infuse AI in Search are expected to drive top-line growth. Circle to Search is driving additional Search and is gaining popularity among younger users. Vertex usage increased 20 times in 2024, with strong developer adoption of Gemini Flash, Gemini 2.0, Imagen 3 and Veo. GOOGL recently launched Gemma 3, a collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models that can run on a single GPU or TPU.Meanwhile, the Google-Wiz combination will offer security offerings that are supported on multi-cloud and are expected to tackle threats emerging from the advancement of AI, prevent breaches and help enterprises respond to breaches more efficiently. Wiz has a stellar clientele with its cloud security platform currently used byAmazonAMZN,MicrosoftMSFT andOracleORCL. The Wiz buyout reflects the growing importance of Google Cloud in the company’s growth plans. The segment accounted for 12.4% of total revenues in 2024, growing 30.6% over 2023, better than the 26% growth it registered in 2023 over 2022. The addition of Wiz to Google Cloud will boost competitive prowess against the likes of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in the cloud computing space.  Per Statista, which cited Synergy Research Group data, Amazon’s share in the worldwide cloud infrastructure market amounted to 30% in the fourth quarter of 2024, ahead of Microsoft’s Azure platform at 21% and Google Cloud at 12%.

Key Points Alphabet(GOOGL-1.63%)(GOOG-1.67%)stock reached an all-time high price of $207.05 on Feb. 4, riding a wave of strong growth and earnings momentum from 2024. For shareholders, the last few months have been challenging with concerns over the strength of the global economy rattling the broader stock market. At the time of writing on April 11, shares of Alphabet are down 24% from that record high. Despite this turbulence, what hasn't changed is the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Innovations in areas like machine learning, automation, andgenerative AIare rapidly transforming the global economy. Alphabet is at the forefront of this wave, poised to capitalize on significant long-term growth opportunities. Here are four reasons I believe Alphabet is the best AI stock to buy right now. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet's AI strategy stands out, integrating machine learning, generative AI, and automation across its ecosystem. The company's diverse user base in market-leading platforms such as Google Search, YouTube, Android, and Chrome is an edge within the tech sector, leveraging vast amounts of unique user data to support its cutting-edge AI models. This AI prowess is evident in Google Cloud, which has been a major growth driver capturing exceptional demand. That includes the unique Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) -- a custom chip designed by Google to power its specific AI workloads. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai commented on the company's unique positioning and the benefits of its vertically integrated AI strategy. In the fourth-quarter earnings conference call, Pichai said: \"We have a unique advantage because we develop every component of our technology stack, including hardware, compilers, models and products. This approach allows us to drive efficiencies at every level, from training and serving, to developer productivity.\" Several growth tailwinds support Alphabet's long-term outlook and AI leadership consolidation, including: The best part is the sense that Alphabet is just getting started. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is800%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500. They just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now… *Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025 I appreciate Alphabet's high-quality fundamentals, scale, and diversification, which are crucial amid the uncertainty surrounding trade tariffs under the Trump administration. Unlike its tech peers, such as Amazon andApple, Alphabet's core digital advertising business, which accounted for 78% of its revenue last year, is largely shielded from tariffs on imported goods. With over half of its business outside the U.S., Alphabet appears resilient, with indications suggesting it's business as usual into the second quarter. After a record-breaking 2024 with 14% revenue growth and earnings per share (EPS) of $8.04, Alphabet is expected to continue delivering stellar earnings growth and strong free cash flow. Wall Street analysts project further upside, including double-digit revenue growth in 2025 and an EPS estimate of $8.90, representing an 11% year-over-year increase. Recent cost-saving measures, such as reported headcount reductions, could support profitability margins to exceed earnings forecasts. With a solid balance sheet and $96 billion in cash, Alphabet is well-equipped to navigate any macroeconomic environment. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. YOY = year over year. Alphabet stands out as a top AI stock because of its bargain valuation. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17, Alphabet trades at a discount to its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, including AI titans Apple, Amazon,Meta Platforms, Microsoft, andNvidia, which average around 26. Given Alphabet's double-digit earnings growth, there's a case to be made that shares are undervalued.  GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts I'm bullish on Alphabet, viewing the recent stock price weakness asa buy-the-dip opportunity. While risks persist, including regulatory scrutiny and a delicate macroeconomic environment, the company's AI leadership positions it to emerge stronger. As long as Alphabet continues delivering profitable growth, it may just be a matter of time before the stock makes a new all-time high.

Key Points It's not an easy matter to make predictions about the stock market, since no one really knows what it will do from day to day or even year to year. (Over long periods, though, it has always gone up.) Still, I'm here to make a prediction, and I'm predicting that three stocks in particular will be worth more thanCostco Wholesale(COST-0.23%)a decade from now. Here's a look at those companies -- and at Costco too. Image source: Getty Images. First off, why am Ifocusing on Costco? Don't I like it? Well, I do, and I'm a longtime shareholder. But arguably, the stock price has gottenahead of itselfat recent levels. Costco's forward-lookingprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, for example, was recently 50, well above its five-year average of 39. Its recentprice-to-sales ratiowas 1.53, above the five-year average of 1.08. With 903 locations worldwide (623 in the U.S. and Puerto Rico) and a recent market value of $428 billion, it may be hard for Costco to grow at a rapid clip. Also, if a widely feared recession happens, maybe Costco will see some customers let their$65-per-year membershipslapse, as they fear spending too much at visits to Costco. (Costco does have lots of great prices, but it can be hard to not spend a lot there.) Costco has averaged annual gains of around 20% over the past 10 and 15 years. Let's be a little conservative and estimate a 12% growth rate for the coming decade. That would put its market value at $1.3 trillion in a decade. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM1.03%)is a giant amongsemiconductor companies.  While most only design chips, Taiwan Semiconductor actually manufactures them. It's the biggest chip maker by far -- with a recent market share of 67%. There's a lot to like about the company, such as itsapparent joint venturewith U.S.-basedIntel. As there's pressure to make more chips in the U.S., this could benefit both companies. Taiwan Semiconductor has always planned to invest more than $100 billion in U.S.-based plants.Appleislikely to be a major customerof Taiwan Semi's U.S.-built chips. Meanwhile, the company is getting a tailwind from the proliferation ofartificial intelligence(AI), as it requires more and better chips. The company's stock seemsreasonably pricedat recent levels. Shares have grown in value at an average annual rate of around 20% over the past 10 and 15 years. If they grow by just 10%, that will take the market value from a recent $823 billion to $2.1 trillion. Google parentAlphabet(GOOG-1.67%)(GOOGL-1.63%)is another likely company to be worth more than Costco in a decade. That may not be a surprise, because it'salreadyworth more, with a recent market value of $1.9 trillion. Thus, even if there is a big recession, Alphabet is likely to remain bigger. Better still,it's undervalued, with a recent forward P/E of 16.3 -- well below the five-year average of 22.5. (That's partly due to a recent disappointing earnings report coupled withambitious spending plans.) But generous spending plans, if executed well, can lead to further growth, and many still havegreat expectations for Alphabet-- whichowns little enterprises such as YouTube, Nest, and more.There are worriesabout the government breaking up the company, but there's also its growing AI technology, its forays into healthcare, its robust YouTube business, and perhaps even self-driving taxis. Tencent Holdings(TCEHY-0.44%)isn't a household name, but it's a major enterprise in China, with a recent market value of $513 billion. To out-value Costco in a decade, it will only need to increase in value by a factor of around 2.5 -- or an average annual gain of around 10%. Its performance has been volatile over the past decade, but it has averaged annual gains of 11%. Better still, its stock appears quite undervalued now, with a recent forward P/E of 2.1, well below the five-year average of 7.5. My colleague Billy Duberstein has dubbed Tencent \"arguablyChina's best technology company,\" adding: Itowns WeChat, China's dominant 1.39 billion-user social media network; is China's leading mobile game publisher; ownsfintechleader TenPay; and is the country's leading video and music streaming platforms. In addition, Tencent is one of China's leadingcloud software companies, and is building its own artificial intelligence (AI) large language model, called HunYuan. The current trade war with China introduces uncertainty into the picture, but Tencent is a powerful conglomerate with many tentacles, and it's been growing. For example, video game revenue rose 23% year over year in the last quarter, and the company's dividend payout was hiked by 32%. I may well end up being wrong about these predictions, but these three companies seem poised to overtake Costco's value in a decade. (That doesn't mean I plan to sell out of Costco, though, as I plan to remain a long-term shareholder of it.) If any of these businesses intrigue you, dig deeper into them.

By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS (Reuters) -A German media company has complained to EU antitrust regulators following Alphabet unit Google's crackdown against companies gaming its search algorithm to push up rankings for other sites. In its complaint to the European Commission, Hamburg-based ActMeraki, until recently called Meraki Group GmbH, urged immediate action against the policy, saying it penalises websites. Launched in March last year, Google's site reputation abuse policy targets the practice of publishing third-party pages on a site in an attempt to abuse search rankings by taking advantage of the host site's ranking signals, commonly referred to as parasite SEO. ActMeraki's complaint echoed a joint grievance by the European Publishers Council, the European Newspaper Publishers Association and the European Magazine Media Association which issued a letter on Tuesday calling for regulatory action. \"Google continues to unilaterally set the rules of doing business online in its own favour, preferencing its own commercial offerings and depriving competing service providers of any visibility. It is time to put an effective end to this,\" ActMeraki's lawyer Thomas Hoppner said. Google said its spam policy was in response to user feedback. \"We've heard very clearly from users that site reputation abuse - commonly referred to as 'parasite SEO' - leads to a bad search experience for users, and this policy update helps to crack down on this behaviour,\" a Google spokesperson said. \"We enforce our spam policies through a careful review process, which includes a well-defined reconsideration process for affected site owners.\" The Commission, which acts as the competition enforcer in the 27-country European Union, did not respond to repeated emailed requests for comment. The publishers said Google's allegedly non-transparent manual penalty adjustments and inconsistent policy enforcement against websites for cooperating with third-party content providers have hurt their traffic and revenues. They said media outlets in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and other European countries have reported sharp drops in search rankings since Google enforced its policy in January.

Japan's competition regulator has told Google (GOOGL,Financials) tostop pressuring smartphone makersinto prioritizing its own apps and services, a move that could reshape how major tech firms operate in the country. The Japan Fair Trade Commission on Tuesday issued a cease and desist order against the U.S. tech giant the first time Japan has taken formal action against one of Silicon Valley's biggest names over antitrust concerns. Regulators say Google struck deals with phone manufacturers that effectively sidelined rival services, requiring Android phones to give Google's search engine and apps top billing. Those contracts, the watchdog said, likely gave Google an unfair advantage while making it harder for competitors to get a foothold. As part of the order, Google must bring in a third-party monitor to review and report on its business practices. In response, the company said it was disappointed with the decision but added that it would work with the commission to ensure Android remains a competitive and open platform. The case is part of a growing global push to rein in the power of tech platforms, especially when it comes to how they bundle services and dominate user access points. Regulators in the European Union and the United States have brought similar cases against Google and other major players over how their software ecosystems are structured. Japan's move adds pressure on Big Tech to rethink how they do business in international markets, especially where local regulators are becoming more assertive about leveling the playing field.

Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter. Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises. The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.

The uncertain macroeconomic environment is diminishing investors’ readiness to pay high prices for stocks related to artificial intelligence. Despite the continued buzz around the technology, no one seems interested in buying the falling stocks.

The narrative around AI stocks has also begun to change because investors are critiquing that prices have become too expensive, and because there is intensifying competition from Chinese companies developing their own AI offerings. In the latest news, seven Republican U.S. senators have also sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The letter urges him to get rid of a Biden administration rule that restricts global access to AI chips before it kicks in next month. The letter claims that the AI diffusion rule will deter U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, which is why it demands an “immediate action” to halt it. The rule is set to take effect on May 15. “Every day this rule remains in place, American companies face mounting uncertainty, stalled investments, and the risk of losing critical global partnerships that cannot be easily regained. We urge you to withdraw this rule and propose an alternative that is effective in preventing Communist China from capturing the world market in leading technology without compromising American advantages.” It also noted how the rule puts countries into three tiers, with only 18 nations in the Tier 1 group with the easiest access to American technology. Those in tier 2 have to face “arbitrary purchase limits and a cumbersome licensing process.” Meanwhile, it asserted that Tier 3 countries are already “rightly restricted.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

The move is the latest from an AI firm in the ongoing tech arms race in the sector to make their own AI-powered assistant stand out, and comes on the same day Google announced it was launching a new AI video generation tool within its Gemini Advanced AI assistant tool. Anthropic, which is backed by investment from both Google and Amazon, is seeking to offer an alternative to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. The firm said its update to Claude would make it a “more informed and capable collaborator”. As well as the Google integration, Anthropic announced a new research capability which would enable Claude to search across both a user’s existing work and the web to help find information and provide more thorough answers. Offering tools more capable of helping with research work in this fashion, and chatbots more able to “reason” and show the logic behind how it reaches an answer, have become the latest trend in commercial AI apps in recent months. On its own update, Google said it would now allow users to create eight-second videos using text prompts created by its latest video model, Veo 2, and within Gemini for the first time. Until now, users have only been able to generate AI images from within Gemini. Many experts have raised concerns about AI-powered video generation, and how they could be used to spread disinformation. Google said it had taken “important steps” to make video generation a “safe experience”, including watermarking every frame of videos created so it is clear they are AI-generated, and said it was continuing to work to ensure videos would not be generated that violated its policies.

      "content": "Let CFO Dive’s free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox.  A significant “endeavor at this size and scale requires agility and refinement as we learn and grow with our customers,” Microsoft’s Noelle Walsh said. Microsoft has halted talks for, or delayed development of,data center projects across the world, Bloomberg reported earlier this month, citing anonymous sources. “In recent years, demand for our cloud and AI services grew more than we could have ever anticipated and to meet this opportunity, we began executing the largest and most ambitious infrastructure scaling project in our history,” Walsh said in her blog post. “By nature, any significant new endeavor at this size and scale requires agility and refinement as we learn and grow with our customers. What this means is that we are slowing or pausing some early-stage projects.” In January, Microsoft President Brad Smith said the company was planning to spend roughly$80 billion during the current fiscal yearon AI-enabled data centers to train large language models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications. The software provider remains on track to achieve this spending goal despiteWalsh’s comments,a spokesperson told CFO Dive, adding the company had nothing further to share on the matter. The pullback comes as Microsoft and other big tech companies face growing investorscrutiny over their heavy AI spending. It also comes as President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-againtariff measures are creating added pressureand uncertainty for tech executives. Wedbush analysts have called the current tariff situation an “economic Twilight Zone” that has created “real damage to the corporate spending mentality.” “We estimate that 10%-15% (could be conservative) of many cloud and AI initiatives in the US we are tracking in the field could be pushed/slowed down during this period of uncertainty and Microsoft will be front and center in this economic period of uncertainty,” the analysts said in a research note last week. The administration imposed sweeping new levies on imported goods on April 2, but has since walked some of them back. On April 9, Trump announced a 90-day pause on some tariffs on goods from most U.S. trade partners while imposing 125% tariffs on China, triggering a full-scale trade war with the country. China has retaliated by hiking its tariffs on goods imported from the U.S. to 125%. Other tariffs that remain in place in the U.S. include a baseline tariff of 10% for trading partners targeted in Trump’s sweeping April 2 announcement as well as levies imposed on steel and aluminum imports. Meanwhile, on Sunday,Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnicksaid a Friday decision by the administration to exempt electronic devices such as smartphones, iPhones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs — including the 125% levies imposed on Chinese imports — was only a temporary reprieve, with those products expected to face separate levies in the near future. Prior to the Friday announcement, analysts predicted the reciprocal tariffs would be devastating to IT hardware companies that have substantial China production exposure. Morgan Stanley analysts had estimated that Apple alone faced an annual sales impact of as much as $33 billion. Tariffs can also potentially hurt the tech sector by causing enterprise customers to tighten their IT spending and raising the cost of raw materials such as steel needed for building data centers, according to Hank Galligan, BDO’s national technology industry leader. “Clearly, the cost will have an impact on the amount of capacity that will be able to be built,” he said in an interview.

Key Points TheS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)is made up of 500 companies from 11 different economic sectors. The information technology sector is the largest by a wide margin, representing 29.9% of the entire value of the index. The S&P 500 recently suffered a peak-to-trough decline of 19%, falling just shy of the bear-market threshold of 20%. However, theS&P 500 Information Technologyindex plunged by as much as 26%, placing it firmly in bear territory.Apple,Microsoft, andNvidiaare just some of the heavyweights in the information technology sector, so it's a good proxy for the performance of some of America's most valuable companies. TheVanguard Information Technology ETF(VGT0.44%)exclusively invests in stocks from the information technology sector (including those inside and outside the S&P 500), and it has outperformed the S&P 500 every year, on average since it was established in 2004. Therefore, investors with a spare $550 might want to take the opportunity to buy one share in this fund while it's trading at a discount during the tech bear market. Image source: Getty Images. On April 2, President Trump announced plans to impose a sweeping 10%tariffon all physical products imported into America, in addition to a series of much higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on goods from specific countries. The reciprocal tariffs have since been paused for 90 days pending negotiations between the U.S. and its trading partners, except for those placed on China, which remain active. Sweeping tariffs have immediately increased the cost of living for consumers, which could dent America's economic growth. Plus, some countries have imposed their own tariffs in retaliation, which will also hurt U.S. exporters. This is a cocktail for weaker corporate earnings, which is whythe S&P 500 suffered such a sharp declineover the last few weeks. However, many of the products and services produced by companies in the information technology sector aren't directly affected by the tariffs, which is why I believe the sector's underperformance relative to theS&P 500represents a big opportunity for investors. For example, semiconductors have been excluded from President Trump's tariffs from the beginning, which means the industry-leadingartificial intelligence(AI) chips produced by companies like Nvidia andBroadcomwon't be affected. Moreover,Microsoftprimarily sells digital products like the Windows operating system and 365 productivity suite (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), in addition tocloud servicesthrough its Azure platform. None of those are subject to the tariffs (for now). Further, last weekend, President Trump announced that smartphones and computers will be removed from the reciprocal tariffs that are still in place on imports from China. This significantly benefits Apple, which manufactures around 90% of its iPhones in that country. Below is a list of other holdings in the Vanguard Information TechnologyETFthat primarily sell software, cloud services, digital products, or exempted products like semiconductors: Stock Vanguard ETF Portfolio Weighting Salesforce 1.78% Oracle 1.72% Accenture 1.38% Adobe 1.22% Palantir Technologies 1.13% Qualcomm 1.12% Advanced Micro Devices 1.02% Palo Alto Networks 0.81% Micron Technology 0.68% CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) 0.63% Data source: Vanguard. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Feb. 28, 2025, and are subject to change. The Vanguard ETF holds 314 different stocks. However, the above 10 stocks, combined with Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Broadcom, account for a whopping 61.7% of the entire value of its portfolio. With all of that said, even though the above companies aren't directly impacted by tariffs, they are likely to suffer indirect consequences from President Trump's trade policies. If the U.S. economy does slow down, they will experience weaker demand for their products and services. This effect could be especially pronounced for the likes of Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD, which are relying on hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data center infrastructure spending from just a handful of customers each year to fuel their growth. Some of that potential risk is already priced in.Nvidia stock, for instance, is down by 25% from its record high, wiping a staggering $900 billion off the company'smarket capitalization. That reduces the potential downside risk for investors who swoop in and buy the Vanguard ETF today. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF was recently down by as much as 27% from its record high, so it's heavily underperforming the S&P 500 at the moment. However, the picture looks very different when we zoom out and examine its long-term performance. The Vanguard ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 12.8% since it was established in 2004, comfortably beating the average annual gain of 9.6% in the S&P 500 over the same period. That 3.2 percentage point difference doesn't sound like much at face value, but it would have made a world of difference in dollar terms thanks to the magic of compounding: Starting Balance In 2004 Compound Annual Return Balance In 2025 $50,000 12.8% $627,279 $50,000 9.6% $342,761 Calculations by author. In my view, even if the economy slows due toglobal trade tensions, investors are likely to continue buying quality stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. These companies have incredibly strong balance sheets with plenty of cash on hand, in addition to reliable earnings and leadership positions in their respective industries. They could still be the best houses in a bad neighborhood, so to speak, as the rest of the market faces the same economic challenges. Plus, PwC predicts the AI revolution will add a whopping $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, and much of that value will be created by the companies in the information technology sector. As a result, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF might be a great buy during the tech bear market.

President Trump on Tuesday again toutedNvidia’s $500 billion commitmentto building AI infrastructure in the US, pledging to expedite the process for the chip giant and any other company planning big US investments. “This is very big and exciting news. All necessary permits will be expedited and quickly delivered to NVIDIA, as they will to all companies committing to be part of the Golden Age of America!” Trump said in a Truth Social post. Nvidia's announcement brings Big Tech’s investment pledges to US AI infrastructure to just north of $1.6 trillion since Trump's inauguration as thetech world tries to navigate the potential hazards of the president's trade war while staying on the right side of a malleable administration. Nvidia, for its part, did seem to make moves in US manufacturing partially due to Trump’s chaotic approach to trade policy, with on-again, off-again global tariffs affecting imports of AI servers containing its highly coveted GPUs, or graphics processing units. Asked about Trump’s tariffs at its annual GTC event in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was \"preparing, and we have been preparing to manufacture onshore.\" Huangreportedly attended a dinner at Mar-a-Lagolast week, after which the Trump administration backed off new restrictions on the company's chip exports to China. Nvidia's moves are the latest in Big Tech's splashy announcements of plans to expand investments within the US. In February, Apple (AAPL)committed to investing $500 billion to expand its US manufacturingover the next four years. TSMC (TSM) — which makes the world's most advanced chips with most of its manufacturing capacity in Taiwan —has committed to spending $100 billionover a similar time frame. The company had previously committed $65 billion to building out its US manufacturing capabilities with funding from the 2022 Chips and Science Act. Just after Trump's inauguration, Oracle (ORCL), OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), and SoftBank (SFTBY) announceda joint venture called Stargate, which the companies said would spend $500 billion on US AI data centers. And after Trump's election, Microsoft (MSFT) said it wouldspend $80 billion to build AI data centers. The company said \"more than half\" of that total would be invested in the US. Apple's US-centric moves have landed in the spotlight again amid Trump's fluctuating tariff policies. Apple announced its $500 billion commitment just days afterTrump said CEO Tim Cookpromised him hundreds of millions of dollars in US investment and implied the pledge was due to his approach to trade policy. \"They don't want to be in the tariffs,\" Trump said in February. However,it’s unclear how much of Apple’s commitment will be from new investments, given that the spending announced was in line with its prior capital expenditures. Nevertheless, Trump's relationship with Cook has weaved its way into tariff developments in the past several days. US Customs and Border Protectionissued regulations late Fridayexempting consumer electronics, networking equipment, and computing products — including GPUs and servers — from reciprocal tariffs. That includes Trump's ever-ballooning 145% levies on China, where Apple still does most of its production. Trump boasted Monday that he \"helped Tim Cook recently.\" \"I don't want to hurt anybody, but the end result is we're going to get to the position of greatness for our country,\" he said. But Trump also set the stage to impose tariffs on semiconductors Tuesday —the Commerce Department opened a probe into computer chips under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which grants the president the authority to impose tariffs on imports seen as essential to national security. And he has promised that most electronics will still get wrapped up in his tariffs. \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,\" he posted Sunday.

OpenAI,the artificial intelligence company backedby Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), is reportedly working on a social media platform built around its generative AI technology, according toThe Verge. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with MSFT. Sources told the outlet that the idea is still in the early stages, but an internal prototype includes a social feed centered on image generation through ChatGPT. It's not yet clear if the project will launch as a new app or be folded into the existing ChatGPT platform, which OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently said reaches about 10% of the global population. OpenAI hasn't commented publicly on the report. The news lands as tensions between Altman and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk continue to grow. Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI who is now suing the company and Microsoft, reportedly made a $97.4 billion all-cash offer to acquire OpenAI earlier this year a bid Altman rejected. Altman later joked online that OpenAI would buy Twitter, now X, for $9.74 billion. Musk's xAI, a rival to OpenAI, recently completed an all-stock acquisition of X. Its Grok chatbot, now available in a standalone app, pulls from X's social posts to train its AI models. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEOSatya Nadellaisn't just celebrating the company's 50th birthday—he's laying the groundwork for its next 50 years. And it starts with artificial intelligence taking center stage. Nadella believes the company is about to launch something as revolutionary as Excel or PowerPoint once were: its AI assistant, Copilot. Nadella recently sat down withGeekWireto reflect on the company’s evolution. He traced Microsoft's DNA back to 1975, whenBill GatesandPaul Allencreated a BASIC interpreter for the Altair. Don't Miss: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm —invest pre-IPO from $0.55 per share now. ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. That early project wasn't just about code—it was about giving people tools to build more technology. Nadella said, \"Technologies will come and go, but the idea is that this company can stay relevant by producing technology so that more and more people around the world can create more digital technology that’s pervasive in our society.\" With Copilot, Microsoft has gone all in on generative AI. First introduced in GitHub Copilot, the tool helped developers write code more efficiently. But now it'sintegrated across Microsoft 365—from Word and Excel to Outlook and PowerPoint—serving as a digital teammate for everyday users. At the core of Nadella's vision, he told GeekWire, is a bold new concept: a new type of inbox designed not for email but for managing the work of fleets of AI assistants. Trending:Invest in the Future of Digital Engagement. Own a Piece of the $100 Billion Metaverse Today for Just $500. Think AI researchers gathering data, AI coders updating software, and AI analysts prepping meeting notes—each acting independently or in coordination, while humans simply direct traffic. Nadella thinks it's as big of a shift as when Excel first replaced calculators. Nadella told GeekWire about a recent personal use case. Before three customer meetings, he had Microsoft 365's Copilot researcher agent pull together everything he needed—internal documents, CRM insights, external articles—into complete briefing docs. \"These are the products I use all the time with high intensity, so, yeah, I think we're beginning to see value,” he said. The speed and depth were comparable to work done by a full analyst team. Microsoft's aggressive expansion in AI is backed by serious money.Microsoft announcedin early January it expects to spend $80 billion on AI infrastructure this fiscal year. That includes massive investments in computing power to support tools like Copilot and Azure OpenAI services. See Also:With Shares Starting at Just $1.52, This Could be Your Chance to Invest in the Future of Healthcare. Much of Microsoft's AI firepower comes from its partnership with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. Later in January, Microsoftreinterated, Microsoft reiterated that the partnership's key elements remain in place for the duration of their contract through 2030, with their access to OpenAI's IP, Microsoft's revenue sharing arrangements, and their exclusivity on OpenAI's APIs all continuing forward. According toTech Startups, Microsoft has poured over $13 billion into OpenAI since 2019, making it a cornerstone of its strategy. But the partnership hasn't been without complications.

By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo'sTermsandPrivacy Policy It's a feature of American politics to want to avoid the appearance of picking winners and losers in the market. That phrase is often used as a rhetorical cudgel to attack opponents as bad for the economy. But one person's favoritism is another's industrial policy. If the market is consumed by the repercussions of tariffs, exemptions to those taxes can mean everything.The potential special carve-outs for tech, however, initially sparked a rally on Monday, fizzled, then rebounded. Part of this confused response from investors was the White Houseseemingly sending mixed signals. After the exclusions from reciprocal tariffs were first unveiled, the president said in a social media post \"there was no Tariff 'exception' announced.\" He later told reporters that his goal was encouraging production to move to the US but added that the administration has to show flexibility. The tech titans hoping to receive assistance from the White House are showing flexibility too, or rathera willingness to support the president's agendaof bolstering domestic manufacturing and investment. Nvidia (NVDA) on Monday said it willproduce up to $500 billion of AI infrastructurein the US within the next four years. That announcement follows other Big Tech commitments from Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) to spend in the US. Recent trading sessions with wild upward swings have made one thing clear: Pronouncements on tariffs arethe only meaningful catalyst for stocksin this uncertain moment. That goes for Big Tech too, whose trillion-dollar tickers are buoyed by global supply chains and customer bases all around the world. It's true that their size and market heft might allow these companies to weather whatever tariff costs come. But people are intimately familiar with how much, say, a phone costs, making a sudden upcharge on a finished product an unsavory consumer experience. It is, perhaps, the modern price of bread. Overall, the dizzying tariff news, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients, is \"a step forward net positive for Apple as well as other tech names.\" It creates the space for some sort of negotiation with China, he said, and can lead to a deescalation of the trade war issues that have left Big Tech caught in the middle. Their importance for American tech supremacy means, in a way, they are too important to fail, and the value they bring to the stock market makes the rest of the S&P seem like lesser moons in a solar system that revolves around them. But in this chaotic environment, the most important distinction of all isn't size alone; it's a tariff carve-out. Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

We recently published a list of the10 Best Machine Learning Stocks to Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other machine-learning stocks. Grand View Research reported that the global machine-learning market was valued at $36.73 billion in 2022. It’s now expected to grow at a 34.8% CAGR from 2023 to 2030. Machine learning helps machines and systems learn from experience instead of through explicit programming. It uses algorithms to improve and analyze vast amounts of complex data to make informed decisions. Machine learning is quickly progressing as AI is rapidly expanding and transforming how businesses and individuals operate. These technological advancements are revolutionizing consumer experiences, and enabling convenient creation of digital services, products, and optimized supply chains. With this, startups can focus on specific solutions while larger companies can deliver comprehensive AI platforms. On April 10, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the cost of AI and what has to happen to bring it down. Jassy emphasized that the growth in data center demand is now so significant that there is no foreseen attenuation here, even with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties under tariffs. While there’s a general belief that the emergence of DeepSeek could now reduce the need for extensive data centers, processing power, and energy consumption previously forecasted at different tech companies, Jassy thinks that DeepSeek’s introduction did not disrupt any of this. Despite cost reductions that occurred have already over time, AI deployment still requires significant investment. He thinks that the current AI operations are expensive due to chip costs and other factors, but big techs, including his own company, would welcome any reductions in AI costs for customers moving forward. Jassy underscored the demand for data centers despite tariff impacts and reflected optimism regarding lowering costs, which would potentially drive innovation and expanded use of AI across industries. AI is still limited and requires substantial human oversight as of now but it has massive potential across various sectors.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other AI stocks to watch amid market volatility. The uncertain macroeconomic environment is diminishing investors’ readiness to pay high prices for stocks related to artificial intelligence. Despite the continued buzz around the technology, no one seems interested in buying the falling stocks. Fluctuating tariff policies from the Trump administration have concerned Wall Street and disrupted global supply chains. The cost of AI infrastructure has increased drastically, especially for companies relying on imported components. READ ALSO:14 AI Stocks Catching Wall Street’s Attentionand9 Trending AI Stocks Making Headlines Today. The narrative around AI stocks has also begun to change because investors are critiquing that prices have become too expensive, and because there is intensifying competition from Chinese companies developing their own AI offerings. In the latest news, seven Republican U.S. senators have also sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The letter urges him to get rid of a Biden administration rule that restricts global access to AI chips before it kicks in next month. The letter claims that the AI diffusion rule will deter U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, which is why it demands an “immediate action” to halt it. The rule is set to take effect on May 15. “Every day this rule remains in place, American companies face mounting uncertainty, stalled investments, and the risk of losing critical global partnerships that cannot be easily regained. We urge you to withdraw this rule and propose an alternative that is effective in preventing Communist China from capturing the world market in leading technology without compromising American advantages.” It also noted how the rule puts countries into three tiers, with only 18 nations in the Tier 1 group with the easiest access to American technology. Those in tier 2 have to face “arbitrary purchase limits and a cumbersome licensing process.” Meanwhile, it asserted that Tier 3 countries are already “rightly restricted.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

On April 14, Wells Fargo reiterated Microsoft as overweight and lowered its price target on the stock to $500 per share from $515, but says it’s standing by the stock ahead of earnings later this month. “For better or worse, FQ3 likely centers on 3 key metrics: Azure growth (AI vs non-AI), CapEx (4Q, FY26 expects), and EPS growth. Despite elevated NT debates, still see MSFT among cleanest/most direct ways to play software/AI trends.” Overall, MSFTranks 2ndon our list of AI stocks to watch amid market volatility. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

The group of tech giants — Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta META — known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" has been battered during the ongoing tariff turmoil.Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETFMAGS has lost 5.9% past month (as of April 14, 2025). However, the group may see a turnaround once the first-quarter earnings season concludes, according to a note from Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham, as quoted on CNBC. The cluster of tech giants is slowly regaining investor attention. Following two years of explosive growth driven by the AI boom, these giants have cooled significantly, with valuations now falling to levels last seen before ChatGPT launched in late 2022. While the recent pause in retaliatory tariffs on electronics offers some relief, Graham believes the companies will still strike a cautious tone in their guidance. He noted that many of these firms are still vulnerable to potential regulatory retaliation. After all, the trade environment, though improved over the past week, is still volatile. However, the risk level for investors should significantly fall post Q1 earnings season as, by that time, we would have the companies’ rhetorics. Stock prices have come down considerably. Amazon’s trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, for example, is now at 32—down sharply from 86 on the day ChatGPT debuted. NVIDIA, long considered the top AI play, has also seen its P/E fall to 36 from the mid-50s. Other mega-cap tech names show similar trends. Apple trades at a 29 P/E, nearly back to its pre-AI rally level of 25. Alphabet is at 18, in line with late 2022, and Microsoft sits at 29, slightly above its previous 26. Only exceptions are Tesla and Meta. Tesla’s P/E ratio has surged to 119, well above its 2022 level of 70, while Meta Platforms trades at 23 compared to just 10 pre-AI. However, most of the Magnificent Seven remain deep in correction territory or the bear market. Last week saw a wave of bargain-hunting amid market volatility. The latest announcement of some kind of tariff exemptions to electronics imports may act as a major tailwind. While many are now interested in individual stock picking in the Mag-7 group (based on each company's individual strength and weakness), the group's core strengths remain intact: solid balance sheets, and enduring competitive advantages, per analysts. Bottom Line No one underrates the opportunities in the -Mag-7 group. But the era of group-wide rallies appears to be over, replaced by more scrutinized stock selection and measured optimism. Despite more attractive valuations, investors are no longer treating the group as the pillar of Wall Street. The “Magnificent Seven” have probably fallen from grace. Stock performances within the group have diverged, due to factors such as new cheaper-cost AI entrants (e.g., DeepSeek) and individual companies’ ability to handle broader macro uncertainty (read: Will the Rise of DeepSeek Usher in a New AI Era? ETFs in Focus). . ETF Picks Microsoft and Alphabet shares have been less beaten down over the tumultuous past month. MSFT-heavy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) likeiShares Global Tech ETFIXN and Alphabet-heavy ETFs likeFidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETFFCOM can be played.

Zacks Investment Research SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Tesla's plans to ship components from China for Cybercab and Semi electric trucks in the United States were suspended after President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods amid a trade war, said a person with direct knowledge.  The move could disrupt Tesla's plan to start mass production of the much-anticipated models, which its CEO Elon Musk has been touting to investors as major innovations providing growth momentum of the U.S. automaker. In the most recent trading session, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) closed at $94.50, indicating a +1.18% shift from the previous trading day.

(Bloomberg) -- Elliott Investment Management has built a position in Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. worth more than $1.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Most Read from Bloomberg How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? Trump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space LA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs $15 Million Fund Bets Leadership Training Can Improve Chicago Policing Elliott plans to engage with the software and networking company to help it boost value, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the details aren’t public. The investment makes Elliott one of the company’s top five shareholders, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Elliott’s exact intentions at HPE couldn’t be immediately learned. HPE shares, which jumped as much as 8.8% Tuesday, closed up 5.1% to $15.01 in New York trading, giving the company a market value of about $20 billion. The stock is still down 39% from its all-time high in January. Elliott’s move is one of the first major activist campaigns unveiled after the market turmoil related to President Donald Trump’s tariff plans. Representatives for Elliott and HPE declined to comment. While artificial intelligence has fueled heavy demand for hardware such as servers and networking, HPE hasn’t been able to seize the moment as much as its peers including Dell Technologies Inc. “We have always argued that HPE either does not have the required portfolio for today’s enterprise- and AI-driven infrastructure, or it does but is unable to effectively compete and win business,” Susquehanna International Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini said in a note. In March, HPE said its profit this year would be sharply lower than analyst estimates as it grapples with tariffs, weak margins on server sales and execution issues. It also said it would eliminate about 3,000 jobs. Woo Jin Ho, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said at the time that the company’s actions suggested “meaningful inefficiencies.” Deutsche Bank AG analysts described the firm’s first-quarter results as “disappointing.” HPE could navigate the burden of tariffs since it’s one of the server and storage companies that adhere to the US-Mexico-Canada agreement that replaced NAFTA, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Track Record Elliott has a successful track record in technology, having pushed for changes at Salesforce Inc., SAP SE and Citrix Systems Inc. among others. It took Citrix private in a $13 billion deal with Vista Equity Partners in 2022. Salesforce implemented growth plans to avoid a proxy fight, while SAP replaced its chief executive officer within six months of Elliott’s position becoming public. Elliott was also a longtime investor in Dell, one of HPE’s major competitors. Dell’s shares have jumped almost 300% since its return to public trading in 2018, outperforming HPE. The activist’s move comes as data center giants such as Microsoft Corp. have pulled back on projects around the world, while Chinese rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. warned of a potential bubble forming in AI data center construction. HPE, which split from printer and PC maker HP Inc. in 2015, has been run by Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri for the past seven years. Top managers at Crown Castle Inc. and Johnson Controls International Plc lost their jobs after fights with the hedge fund. HPE has been a serial dealmaker. Its predecessor company bought Aruba Networks in 2015 for about $3 billion. HPE itself acquired Nimble Storage in 2017 and supercomputer company Cray Inc. in 2019. But its largest deal to date is the pending $14 billion takeover of Juniper Networks Inc., a company that Elliott had targeted more than a decade ago. The acquisition, announced in early 2024, has been in limbo after the US Justice Department sued to block it over antitrust concerns. A trial date for the antitrust lawsuit has been set for July. --With assistance from Eyk Henning. (Updates with closing share price in third paragraph.)

We recently published a list of the13 Best Technology Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best technology dividend stocks. There was a time when tech stocks drew investor interest purely for their growth potential. But more recently, they’ve been gaining attention for a different reason: dividends. This marks a major shift, given that tech companies have traditionally focused their resources on innovation and expansion. Today, a significant portion of the tech sector consists of established firms with solid business models, healthy margins, steady growth, strong financials, and manageable debt levels. According to S&P, about 39% of tech companies in the Composite 1500 index are now returning capital to shareholders through dividends—a notable jump from 28% back in 2013. In addition, technology stocks have emerged as a major contributor to the market’s overall dividend payouts. FactSet data showed that tech companies now account for around 13% of the total dollar value of dividends within the S&P Composite Index. That puts the tech sector just behind financials, making it the second-largest source of dividends in the index—with a strong chance of taking the top spot in the near future. What’s more surprising is that tech companies haven’t just begun distributing dividends—they’ve also seen a select group consistently raise their payouts year after year. This group includes some of the world’s most prominent and successful names, alongside major global consulting firms, credit card providers, and other tech-adjacent players. Over the past several years, dividend growth from the technology sector has outpaced that of the broader market. Data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed that tech companies within the S&P Composite more than doubled their total dividend payouts by 2023 compared to 2013. This growth ranks as the fourth highest among all sectors and significantly surpasses the Index’s overall dividend increase of 7.2% during the same timeframe. With tech’s current dividend payout ratio at just 39%, there appears to be considerable room for further expansion. The move by leading tech firms to start paying dividends has sparked discussions around finding the right balance between capital appreciation and income generation. Sam Witherow, who manages the JPM Global Equity Income fund, noted that although his fund has traditionally included a mix of dividend-paying companies and those focused on capital growth, the characteristics of some of these companies are now evolving. He made the following comment about these strategies: “We are seeking to provide clients with both a yield premium to the market and a dividend growth premium to the market at the aggregate portfolio level. It’s the combination of the two characteristics that typically leads to the best risk-adjusted returns. To deliver this we have always looked to have diversified exposure across global industries including traditionally growthier industries like consumer discretionary or tech.” Sam Buckingham, an investment manager at Abrdn Portfolio Solutions, pointed out that growth stocks offering smaller dividends could be useful for income funds aiming to diversify across different sectors and investment factors. He explained that while these stocks typically start with lower yields, they often have the potential for dividend growth over time. When paired with more traditional income stocks—like those in the utilities sector that offer higher initial payouts but slower growth—they can help create a more balanced portfolio. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector. A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. For this list, we scanned the holdings of the S&P Information Technology index, which tracks the performance of major tech companies. From there, we identified companies that pay dividends to shareholders and picked 13 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, as per Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database. The stocks are ranked according to the number of hedge funds having stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Companies that don’t recognize that the people central to running the business “are already diverse” may miss out on opportunities to excel, Lisa Brummel said. Lisa Brummel retired as the executive vice president of human resources for Microsoft 11 years ago, but, as the co-owner of the WNBA’s Seattle Storm and an active board member and company advisor, she’s hardly watching from the sidelines. Editor’s note: This conversation was edited for clarity and length. LISA BRUMMEL:The goal is really to blend and teach the AI models how to more effectively balance inherent human bias and humanize technology bias. The goal is to keep training to get to that right fit; the ongoing interaction between humans and AI models is really what makes it better. You have the best of both worlds. We have always been very focused on DEI. We recognize that diversity is an important part of building a business. It’s the way we build our brand, and we need to because it reflects our team, it reflects our community, and it reflects the game of women’s basketball. If you’re not going to recognize that the people who are central to running your business and making it successful are already diverse, if you don’t help elevate them, you’re going to miss the opportunity to really accelerate your business. I don’t care as much about what’s happening around [DEI]. We have proven over 17 years that this is a successful way to run a business; you can look at the growth of our business. Why would we ever abandon it? We will champion it. Our business also has a very specific arm that focuses on our community, and we focus on elevating Black women in our community and elevating BIPOC people within our community, a program called Force4Change. I do. I played as a kid, and I played in college. I was drafted to play professionally, but it was way back in the day when the leagues weren’t going to sustain themselves. So I went into the workforce right out of college. But I’ve always loved basketball; it’s been my favorite sport. Being an owner of the Seattle Storm was super helpful, because I didn’t really retire from working; I just retired from having someone else manage my time. Also, I did a little bit of HR consulting after I left Microsoft. I think that was sort of an off ramp. I’m now hitting my glide path in retirement, and I’m doing the things that I want to do, mostly on my schedule, and I think I’m doing better work than I did when I was on someone else’s schedule.

      "content": "Oops, something went wrong Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results By Valerie Volcovici WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Microsoft said on Tuesday it signed a contract for a project in Louisiana that would remove 6.75 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over 15 years, which it says is the world's biggest permanent carbon removal project to date. The technology giant's greenhouse gas emissions were 29.1% higher than 2020 levels last year amid growing demand for energy for artificial intelligence uses and it last reported annual greenhouse gas emissions of 17.2 million tons at the end of 2023. The bioenergy carbon capture and storage project being developed by carbon capture company AtmosClear is located at the Port of Greater Baton Rouge and will use materials like sugarcane bagasse and forest trimmings to generate energy and capture the associated carbon emissions and store them underground. The agreement is a part of Microsoft's goal to become carbon negative by 2030. The announcement comes amid uncertainty about the future of U.S. carbon removal and sequestration projects, which have been incentivized over the last few years by an $85 a ton federal tax credit known as 45Q. The Trump administration is seeking to reverse numerous decarbonization incentives put in place during former President Joe Biden's time in office in upcoming budget negotiations. The companies did not comment on whether the project would proceed if the tax credit is scaled back or repealed by the Trump administration. Fidelis, the Texas-based company that owns AtmosClear, said it expects to use the 45Q tax credit for the carbon sequestration component of the project. Fidelis has estimated that the project will result in more than $800 million of investment and around 75 permanent and 600 construction jobs, and could revive forestry management jobs in the region that had been impacted by recent mill closures. Brian Marrs, Microsoft's senior director of energy and carbon, said in a statement the technology giant valued the deal's emphasis on jobs in local agricultural communities. It would also show Louisiana's leadership in becoming a hub for carbon management research and applied technology, he said. Louisiana state officials have been lobbying the U.S. Department of Energy and the state's congressional delegation over the last few days to urge them to save federal funding to support the state's planned Direct Air Capture hub in Calcasieu Parish, as well as the 45Q tax credit. Construction of the plant would begin in 2026, with commercial operations slated to start in 2029. (Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Jamie Freed) SANTIAGO (Reuters) -Chile, Canada and Peru - three of the largest copper suppliers to the United States - have told President Donald Trump's administration that imports of the metal from their countries do not threaten U.S. security interests and should not face potential tariffs.  The comments by the three countries come during an escalating tariff war between the United States and nearly every trading partner on which it relies.  Copper is used in construction, transportation, electronics and many other industries. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday suggested that he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs he previously imposed on the sector, to give carmakers time to adjust their supply chains.

(AP) — Rancher Brett Kenzy hopes President Donald Trump's tariffs will make imported beef expensive enough that Americans will turn to cattle raised at home for all their hamburgers and steaks. U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China comes at a bad time for sorghum growers like Dan Atkisson in Kansas, who is nevertheless preparing to increase plantings by 25% this spring.  China accounted for nearly 90% of U.S. sorghum exports last year, ramping up purchases of the crop it uses to feed livestock and make fiery baijiu liquor.  U.S. sorghum exports to China dropped to 78,316 metric tons in January and February from more than 1.4 million metric tons over the same period a year earlier, down 95%, according to U.S. government data.

In the 2018 email, Mr Zuckerberg wrote that he was beginning to wonder if “spinning Instagram out” would be the only way to accomplish important goals. He also noted “there is a non-trivial chance” Meta could be forced to spin off Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in five to 10 years anyway. He wrote that while most companies resist break-ups, “the corporate history is that most companies actually perform better after they’ve been split up”. Asked on Tuesday by lawyer Daniel Matheson, who is leading the antitrust case for the Federal Trade Commission, which incidence in corporate history he had in mind, Mr Zuckerberg responded: “I’m not sure what I had in mind then.” The chief executive, who was the first witness, gave evidence for more than seven hours over two days in the trial that could force Meta to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups the group bought more than a decade ago which have since grown into social media powerhouses. While questioning Mr Zuckerberg on Tuesday morning, Mr Matheson noted that he had referred to Instagram as a “rapidly growing, threatening network”. The lawyer also pointed out Mr Zuckerberg referring to trying to neutralise a competitor by buying the company. But the CEO said while Mr Matheson was able to show documents in court that indicated his concern about Instagram’s growth, he also had many conversations about how excited his company was to acquire Instagram to make a better product. Mr Zuckerberg also said Facebook was in the process of building a camera app for sharing on mobile phones, and he thought Instagram was better at that, “so I wanted to buy them”. He also pushed back against Mr Matheson’s contention that the reason for buying the company was to neutralise a threat. “I think that that mischaracterises what the email was,” Mr Zuckerberg said. Mr Matheson repeatedly brought up emails — many more than a decade old — written by Mr Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram. While acknowledging the documents, Mr Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time did not capture the full scope of his interest in the company. Mr Matheson also brought up a February 2012 message in which Mr Zuckerberg wrote to the former chief financial officer of Facebook that Instagram and Path, a social networking app, had already created meaningful networks that could be “very disruptive to us”. Mr Zuckerberg told the hearing the message was written in the context of a broad discussion about whether they should buy companies to accelerate their own developments. He also said that buying the company, taking it off the market and building their own version was “a reasonable thing to do”. Later on Tuesday, Mark Hansen, a lawyer for Meta, began his questioning of Mr Zuckerberg. The lawyer, in his opening statements on Monday, emphasised that Meta’s services are free and that the company, far from holding a monopoly, actually has a lot of competition. He made a point of bringing up those issues in just over an hour of questioning Mr Zuckerberg, with more expected on Wednesday. “It’s very competitive,” Mr Zuckerberg said, noting that charging for using services like Facebook would probably drive users away because similar services are widely available elsewhere. The trial is one of the first big tests of Donald Trump’s FTC’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during the president’s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Facebook bought Instagram — which was a photo-sharing app with no ads — for a billion dollars in 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook had been known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for 22 billion billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta’s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. US District Judge James Boasberg is presiding over the case. Late last year, he denied Meta’s request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. European Commission may reportedly let companies declare force majeure as part of strategy to rid bloc of Russian fossil fuels by 2027 European shares rose on Tuesday as investors weighed fast-changing U.S. tariff plans, while shares of LVMH slumped after the luxury sector bellwether missed first-quarter sales estimates due to weak sales in the United States and China.  LVMH slid 7.8%, with the group losing its position as Europe's largest luxury company in terms of market capitalization to rival Hermes.

President Trump on Tuesday again toutedNvidia’s $500 billion commitmentto building AI infrastructure in the US, pledging to expedite the process for the chip giant and any other company planning big US investments. “This is very big and exciting news. All necessary permits will be expedited and quickly delivered to NVIDIA, as they will to all companies committing to be part of the Golden Age of America!” Trump said in a Truth Social post. Nvidia's announcement brings Big Tech’s investment pledges to US AI infrastructure to just north of $1.6 trillion since Trump's inauguration as thetech world tries to navigate the potential hazards of the president's trade war while staying on the right side of a malleable administration. Nvidia, for its part, did seem to make moves in US manufacturing partially due to Trump’s chaotic approach to trade policy, with on-again, off-again global tariffs affecting imports of AI servers containing its highly coveted GPUs, or graphics processing units. Asked about Trump’s tariffs at its annual GTC event in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was \"preparing, and we have been preparing to manufacture onshore.\" Huangreportedly attended a dinner at Mar-a-Lagolast week, after which the Trump administration backed off new restrictions on the company's chip exports to China. Nvidia's moves are the latest in Big Tech's splashy announcements of plans to expand investments within the US. In February, Apple (AAPL)committed to investing $500 billion to expand its US manufacturingover the next four years. TSMC (TSM) — which makes the world's most advanced chips with most of its manufacturing capacity in Taiwan —has committed to spending $100 billionover a similar time frame. The company had previously committed $65 billion to building out its US manufacturing capabilities with funding from the 2022 Chips and Science Act. Just after Trump's inauguration, Oracle (ORCL), OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), and SoftBank (SFTBY) announceda joint venture called Stargate, which the companies said would spend $500 billion on US AI data centers. And after Trump's election, Microsoft (MSFT) said it wouldspend $80 billion to build AI data centers. The company said \"more than half\" of that total would be invested in the US. Apple's US-centric moves have landed in the spotlight again amid Trump's fluctuating tariff policies. Apple announced its $500 billion commitment just days afterTrump said CEO Tim Cookpromised him hundreds of millions of dollars in US investment and implied the pledge was due to his approach to trade policy. \"They don't want to be in the tariffs,\" Trump said in February. However,it’s unclear how much of Apple’s commitment will be from new investments, given that the spending announced was in line with its prior capital expenditures. Nevertheless, Trump's relationship with Cook has weaved its way into tariff developments in the past several days. US Customs and Border Protectionissued regulations late Fridayexempting consumer electronics, networking equipment, and computing products — including GPUs and servers — from reciprocal tariffs. That includes Trump's ever-ballooning 145% levies on China, where Apple still does most of its production. Trump boasted Monday that he \"helped Tim Cook recently.\" \"I don't want to hurt anybody, but the end result is we're going to get to the position of greatness for our country,\" he said. But Trump also set the stage to impose tariffs on semiconductors Tuesday —the Commerce Department opened a probe into computer chips under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which grants the president the authority to impose tariffs on imports seen as essential to national security. And he has promised that most electronics will still get wrapped up in his tariffs. \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,\" he posted Sunday.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg once considered separating Instagram from its parent company due to worries about antitrust litigation, according to an email shown Tuesday on the second day of an antitrust trial alleging Meta illegally monopolized the social media market. In the 2018 email, Zuckerberg wrote that he was beginning to wonder if “spinning Instagram out” would be the only way to accomplish important goals, as big-tech companies grow. He also noted “there is a non-trivial chance” Meta could be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in five to 10 years anyway. He wrote that while most companies resist breakups, “the corporate history is that most companies actually perform better after they've been split up.” Asked Tuesday by attorney Daniel Matheson, who is leading the antitrust case for the Federal Trade Commission, which incidence in corporate history he had in mind, Zuckerberg responded: “I'm not sure what I had in mind then.” Zuckerberg, who was the first witness, testified for more than seven hours over two days in the trial that could force Meta to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups the tech giant bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. While questioning Zuckerberg on Tuesday morning, Matheson noted that he had referred to Instagram as being a “rapidly growing, threatening, network.” The attorney also pointed out Zuckerberg's referring to trying to neutralize a competitor by buying the company. But Zuckerberg said while Matheson was able to show documents in court that indicated his concern about Instagram's growth, he also had many conversations about how excited his company was to acquire Instagram to make a better product. Zuckerberg also said Facebook was in the process of building a camera app for sharing on mobile phones, and he thought Instagram was better at that, “so I wanted to buy them.” Zuckerberg also pushed back against Matheson's contention that the reason for buying the company was to neutralize a threat. “I think that that mischaracterizes what the email was,\" Zuckerberg said. In his questioning of Zuckerberg, Matheson repeatedly brought up emails — many of them more than a decade old — written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram. While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. Matheson also brought up a February 2012 message in which Zuckerberg wrote to the former chief financial officer of Facebook that Instagram and Path, a social networking app, already had created meaningful networks that could be “very disruptive to us.” Zuckerberg testified that the message was written in the context of a broad discussion about whether they should buy companies to accelerate their own developments. Zuckerberg also testified that buying the company, taking it off the market and building their own version of it was “a reasonable thing to do.” Later Tuesday, Mark Hansen, an attorney for Meta, began his questioning of Zuckerberg. Hansen, in his opening statements Monday, emphasized that Meta's services are free and that the company, far from holding a monopoly, actually has a lot of competition. He made a point of bringing up those issues in just over an hour of questioning Zuckerberg, with more expected to come Wednesday. “It's very competitive,” Zuckerberg said, noting that charging for using services like Facebook would likely drive users away, since similar services are widely available elsewhere. The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump’s FTC’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump’s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Facebook bought Instagram — which was a photo-sharing app with no ads — for $1 billion in 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta’s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is presiding over the case. Late last year, he denied Meta’s request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. The FTC wanted $30 billion to drop its case. Zuckerberg offered much less and hoped Trump would back him up. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Machine Learning Stocks to Buy Now.

Mark Zuckerberg defended Meta's (META)past acquisitions in court,arguing Instagram and WhatsApp strengthened competition rather than stifled it. Mozelle Thompson, former FTC commissioner and former Facebook Advisory Board member, joins Morning Brief to break down how the FTC is framing Meta's moves as monopolistic and what the outcome could mean. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Briefhere. As we're continuing to watch this play out with Zuckerberg and the FTC, what is the reality of what this outcome could look like and how Facebook once again, or Meta platforms rather, is once again in the position of defending an acquisition of a company that was way, way smaller back then at that time. I'm glad that you raised that, you know, um, we all seem to forget at the time that they acquired uh, uh, uh, Instagram. Instagram was 20 people and they paid a billion dollars for it and everybody thought they were crazy. So, um, that was a very interesting time. You know, it's interesting, the government has framed this as the, um, that Meta bought Instagram and WhatsApp in order to eliminate competition and because of that, that those products have become worse for consumers than they could have been and that the actual market is actually uh the personal social networking, which is among friends. Meta, on the other hand has a different version or a different view of what the market is and what they were doing. They said it was strategic, those products have become better, they still remain free and that the market is actually much bigger. Friends actually are a very small part of what these apps do and what the market is and the market is actually much broader in terms of competition with companies like TikTok and, uh, and X, and YouTube and those provide the real competitive marketplace. So it's interesting that we're also looking at these transactions not only what what they were thinking then, that's not only Meta, but also what the US government was thinking then, but what they what has actually happened since then, 10 years, over 10 years is a very long time. Mhm. Well, it's interesting Moselle because you mentioned TikTok, X, YouTube, all competition, but given how similar to the end consumer that those platforms look to some of the meta platforms, is that argument going to be enough that that competition still exists outside of meta? Well, I think that it it it is pretty real, you know, one of the things that that I I have found interesting in the framing yesterday is that, um, the FTC says that the market uh, uh is actually smaller uh than it really is, that if you look at the broader market, Meta only controls sev 30% of that market. You have all these other companies out there and I think if you look at it from an advertising space, most advertisers view that market is the larger market. They want to figure out how to get to all of those different segments within the marketplace.

By Jody Godoy and Katie Paul WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg considered spinning off popular photo-sharing app Instagram in 2018 over concerns about the growing risk of antitrust scrutiny, according to a document shown at a trial in Washington on Tuesday. The document was shown during Zuckerberg's second day of testimony at the high-stakes trial, in which the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is seeking to unwind Meta's acquisitions of prized assets Instagram and WhatsApp. \"I wonder if we should consider the extreme step of spinning Instagram out as a separate company,\" Zuckerberg said in the memo. At the time, the company was mulling plans to reorganize the social media company and link its apps together more closely. Zuckerberg pushed back in the memo, saying consolidation was likely to yield \"strong business growth\" but cautioning that it also could erode the value of flagship app Facebook's social network, with scant promise that the company would get to keep its full \"family of apps\" in the end. Meta ultimately did not spin off Instagram, instead proceeding with the plan to integrate its apps the following year. But the fact that Zuckerberg even considered the idea is a stunning sign of how seriously he took the threat of precisely the type of antitrust trial proceeding now. \"As calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway,\" he wrote then, noting the possibility that the \"next Democratic president\" could take action to break up tech companies. \"This is one more factor that we should consider since even if we wanted to keep those apps together we may not be able to,\" he said. The FTC ultimately sued Meta in 2020, during President Donald Trump's first term. Trump's antitrust enforcers sued Alphabet's Google the same year, accusing it of monopolizing search. Zuckerberg also downplayed the impact of a spinoff on the company's fortunes at the time in his memo, although Meta has argued publicly since then that attempts to break it up would be damaging. \"While most companies resist break ups, the corporate history is that most companies actually perform better after they've been split up. The synergies are usually less than people think and the strategy tax is usually greater than people think,\" he wrote. 'INSTAGRAM WAS BETTER' Zuckerberg's testimony comes as Meta is defending itself years after the release of other damning statements plucked from Facebook's own documents, like a 2008 email in which he said \"it is better to buy than compete.\" The FTC accuses Meta of holding a monopoly on platforms used to share content with friends and family, where its main competitors in the United States are Snap's Snapchat and MeWe, a tiny privacy-focused social media app launched in 2016. Platforms where users broadcast content to strangers based on shared interests, such as X, TikTok, YouTube and Reddit, are not interchangeable, the FTC argues. The case is widely seen as a test of the new Trump administration's promises to take on Big Tech companies. Zuckerberg testified earlier in the day that Meta bought Instagram because it had a \"better\" camera than the one his company was trying to build at the time. The acknowledgement likewise appeared to support allegations by the FTC that Meta had used a \"buy or bury\" strategy to snap up potential rivals, keep smaller competitors at bay and maintain an illegal monopoly. Asked by an attorney for the FTC whether he thought fast-growing Instagram could be destructive to Meta, then known as Facebook, Zuckerberg said he believed Instagram had a better camera than the one his company was building. \"We were doing a build vs. buy analysis\" while in the process of building a camera app, Zuckerberg said. \"I thought that Instagram was better at that, so I thought it was better to buy them.\" The company argues that his past intentions are irrelevant because the FTC has defined the social media market inaccurately and failed to account for stiff competition Meta has faced from ByteDance's TikTok, Alphabet's YouTube and Apple's messaging app. Zuckerberg also acknowledged that many of the company's attempts at building its own apps had failed. \"Building a new app is hard and many more times than not when we have tried to build a new app, it hasn't gotten a lot of traction,\" Zuckerberg told the court. \"We probably tried building dozens of apps over the history of the company and the majority of them don't go anywhere,\" he said.

Meta Platforms(META) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Shares of this social media company have returned -12.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Meta Platforms belongs, has lost 9.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.22 per share, indicating a change of +10.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.9% over the last 30 days. The consensus earnings estimate of $24.85 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4.2%. This estimate has changed -3% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.90 indicates a change of +12.3% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.3%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. In the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $41.27 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.2%. The $186.33 billion and $210.86 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.3% and +13.2%, respectively. Meta Platforms reported revenues of $48.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +20.6%. EPS of $8.02 for the same period compares with $5.33 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $46.97 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.02%. The EPS surprise was +20.06%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Meta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave thought to spinning off Instagram as Big Tech antitrust scrutiny intensified, according to a 2018 memo that surfaced Tuesday as Zuckerberg took the stand to defend his company against claims that Meta illegally dominated social media. \"I wonder if we should consider the extreme step of spinning Instagram out as a separate company,\" Zuckerberg said in the memo shown on the second day of a trial pitting Meta against President Trump's Federal Trade Commission. \"As calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps Whatsapp in the next 5-10 years anyway,\" Zuckerberg wrote in 2018 to other executives,according to Reuters. The FTC is now asking for D.C. federal district courtJudge James Boasbergas part of this new antitrust trial to force Meta (META) to sell off Instagram as well as its messaging service, WhatsApp. Instagram became a central topic for Zuckerberg as he spent his second day on the witness stand answering numerous questions from government prosecutors and being confronted with his past words and documents. In a 2012 email, Zuckerberg told Facebook’s then-CFO, David Ebersman, that a purchase of Instagram and other startups could be looked at as a way for Facebook to buy time. “Even if some new competitor springs up, buying Instagram, Path, Foursquare etc. now will give us a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again,” Zuckerberg wrote, according to an account of the testimonyreportedby Bloomberg. Zuckerberg agreed under questioning by the FTC’s attorney that buying Instagram was intended to “neutralize a competitor,” but he added that the purchase was also meant to boost Facebook’s quality and functionality. ​​“I read this as talking about incorporating the functionality and staying ahead in terms of quality. But scale is one aspect of that, and time is one aspect of that,” Zuckerberg testified, according to Bloomberg. “It’s not accurate to say that the only reason we were interested was the scale or growth rate, which I think that your question is implying.” Zuckerberg told the court that Facebook’s interest in Instagram was also tied to its struggle to build its own photo-sharing app. While the company was analyzing building versus buying a camera app, he said he thought Instagram was “better at that, so I thought it was better to buy them.\" \"Building a new app is hard,” Zuckerberg testified, “and many more times than not when we have tried to build a new app, it hasn't gotten a lot of traction.” One legal expert who conducted a past Meta inquiry for Congress said he thinks Zuckerberg’s testimony will help the FTC overcome its major hurdles in this case. \"To me, there is no question that they viewed Instagram as a competitive threat,\" said Slade Bond, former chief counsel to a House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee who helped lead a 2019 congressional inquiry into Meta and other Big Tech companies. He is now an attorney with Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca. Bond added that Zuckerberg testified that Facebook had to spend $1 billion to acquire the app because of its skyrocketing growth rate. Those email impressions are \"not subtle,\" Bond said. \"You have a young CEO in his late 20s, writing whatever he thinks to his senior leadership team at any given hour of the day, and now we're supposed to believe it's not true, which just doesn't follow.\" However, to win its case, the FTC must prove that at the time of the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions, Facebook operated in the \"personal social networking\" market, a subset of the broader social media market. And that has itschallenges in marketswhere there's no discrete price for services, according to Bond. “On the question of product market definition, this is just tough for courts, particularly in non-price markets,” Bond said. He explained that in order to prove that Facebook had a monopoly, the FTC will need to show that people use Facebook and Instagram as a specific kind of social media to connect with friends and family. Meta has argued that the FTC misidentified the market in which Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp compete because it left out TikTok, YouTube, X, and LinkedIn. Its lawyers have also noted that the FTC approved the Instagram and WhatsApp purchases more than a decade ago. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage, and many others,\" a spokesperson for Meta said. A spin-off of Instagram would deal a major blow to Meta’s bottom line. The app drove $32 billion in US ad revenue for Meta in 2024, representing 48.4% of its total ad revenue,according to Emarketer. Judge Boasberg allotted roughly two months for both parties to present their cases, potentially stretching the proceedings into July 2025. Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Russia’s rouble has become the world’s best-performing global currency as Donald Trump’s tariff war upends financial markets. Here's why your water bill is going up. (Reuters) -ASML, the world's biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment, said on Wednesday that tariffs were increasing uncertainty around its outlook for 2025 and 2026, but stood by its annual guidance as the race for AI rages on.  CEO Christophe Fouquet said his conversations with customers supported ASML's expectations that 2025 and 2026 would be growth years.  \"However, the recent tariff announcements have increased uncertainty in the macro environment,\" Fouquet said in a statement. Nvidia on Tuesday said it would take $5.5 billion in charges after the U.S. government limited exports of its H20 artificial intelligence chip to China, a key market for one of its most popular chips.  Nvidia's AI chips have been a key focus of U.S. export controls as U.S. officials have moved to keep the most advanced chips from being sold to China as the U.S. tries to keep ahead in the AI race.  After those controls were implemented, Nvidia began designing chips that would come as close as possible to U.S. limits. Nvidia did not warn at least some major customers in advance about new U.S. export rules it was told about a week ago requiring it to obtain licenses to sell its China-focused artificial intelligence chip, according to two sources familiar with the matter.  The U.S. chipmaker disclosed on Tuesday that American officials had informed the company on April 9 that its H20 chip would require an export license for sales to China.  The move to restrict H20 shipments marks Washington's latest effort to limit China's access to advanced semiconductors, as the United States seeks to maintain its edge in AI technology. It's been a sea of red in Asia so far on Wednesday, with new U.S. moves turning up the heat in the trade war with China, but at least the losses have been relatively shallow compared with other down days of the past few weeks.  Washington issued new export licensing requirements for Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 artificial intelligence chips to China.  Nvidia's shares slumped 6% in after-hours trading, after it said the move would cost $5.5 billion.

We recently published a list ofGoldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in. As we recentlydiscussedin another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities. So, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last. Warren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’sBerkshirepicks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities. Overall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio. So, let’s take a look at the top Goldman Sachs value stocks. A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. To compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Goldman Sachs' Q4 2024 Stake Value: $8,269,459,946 P/E Ratio as of April 11: 21.41 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 262 Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), with a P/E ratio of 21.41, ranks 2nd on our list of the Goldman Sachs value stocks.

The analyst commended Meta’s strong ad checks and solid revenue growth, with Q2 projected to bring in $42.5 billion to $45.5 billion. While there are some concerns around e-commerce and China, Meta still looks financially healthy and undervalued, trading at a low PEG ratio, according to Champion. On February 13, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) declared a $0.525 per share quarterly dividend, a 5% increase from its prior dividend of $0.50. The dividend was distributed on March 26, to shareholders listed by March 14. Meta Platforms, Inc.

Futures edged down Tuesday morning, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow trading just below break-even, as investors braced for a flurry of corporate earnings. The muted open followed Monday’s tech-led rally, which briefly masked deeper market jitters tied to tariffs and macro uncertainty. That rally capped a volatile session, with the Dow gaining 0.78%, the S&P 500 rising 0.79%, and the Nasdaq up 0.64%. All three indexes dipped into negative territory before recovering, lifted by tech stocks after the Trump administration announced a surprise tariff exemption. Apple (AAPL) climbed more than 2%, while Palantir Technologies (PLTR) jumped nearly 5% after NATO finalized its acquisition of the company’s AI-powered Maven Smart System. Auto stocks also rallied on hopes of tariff relief, after Trump floated the possibility of exemptions for carmakers shifting parts production. General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) both gained over 3%, though no formal policy details were released. Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) all reported results Tuesday before the bell, offering an early read on consumer credit, capital flows, and healthcare demand. Rent the Runway (RENT) also posted earnings, adding a data point from the consumer discretionary space. After the close, United Airlines (UAL) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) are set to report, offering insights from the travel and trading sectors still to come. Bank of America beat expectations in the first quarter, with EPS of $0.90 on $27.37 billion in overall revenue, lifted by a strong showing in its trading division. Like Goldman Sachs (GS), the bank benefited from market volatility, which juiced results even as the broader economic outlook remains uncertain. Looking to Bank of America’s consumer banking division, revenue rose 3% to $10.5 billion, with combined credit and debit card spend hitting $228 billion — up 4% from a year ago. The bank added around 250,000 new consumer checking accounts, marking its 25th straight quarter of growth, and logged 4 billion digital logins, with 65% of sales now digitally enabled. Still, CEO Brian Moynihan struck a cautious tone, noting that “we potentially face a changing economy in the future.” Citigroup posted first-quarter 2025 net income of $4.1 billion, or $1.96 per share, on $21.6 billion in revenue — a 3% increase from a year ago. Growth was broad-based across all five core businesses, with standout performances in the Markets and Wealth divisions. U.S. personal banking revenue rose 2% to $5.2 billion, powered by gains in Branded Cards and Retail Banking, though partially offset by a drop in retail services. Net interest income climbed 6%, fueled by loan growth in branded cards and wider deposit spreads in its retail banking. Johnson & Johnson beat Wall Street expectations in the first quarter, reporting adjusted earnings per share of $2.77 on revenue of $21.89 billion. Sales of cancer drug Darzalex jumped 20% year-over-year to $3.24 billion, helping drive 4.2% growth in the company’s Innovative Medicine segment. The healthcare giant raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $91.6 billion and $92.4 billion, reflecting the impact of its Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition and the addition of Caplyta, a treatment for bipolar depression. However, adjusted EPS guidance held steady at $10.50 to $10.70 as the company factors in tariffs, deal-related costs, and currency headwinds. J&J also moved to reverse $7 billion previously set aside for talc-related legal settlements, after courts rejected its bankruptcy-based strategy for resolving lawsuits over its discontinued baby powder. The company maintains the claims are without merit and says it will defend them in state courts. In tech news, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday as the Federal Trade Commission resumed its antitrust trial against the company, zeroing in on claims that Meta cemented its dominance by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC argues the deals were part of a “buy or bury” strategy to crush competition, and it wants Meta to divest both platforms. Zuckerberg pushed back, insisting the acquisitions benefited consumers and that Meta still faces intense pressure from rivals like TikTok and YouTube (GOOGL). The outcome of the trial — set to run through July — could reshape not just Meta’s empire, but who gets to decide what “competition” really means in the platform era. For the latest news,Facebook,TwitterandInstagram. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of 7.78% and 1.26%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 2025. Do the numbers hold clues to what lies ahead for the stock? Johnson & Johnson is holding its earnings outlook steady despite President Donald Trump signaling he could put tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry. The administration announced earlier it would conduct an investigation into drug imports. That move is widely seen as a first step toward imposing new levies. Earnings and revenue both beat estimates for the quarter. Johnson & Johnson CFO Joe Wolk joined Bloomberg Open Interest to talk about how tariffs could hit the industry and the drug maker's bottom line. Health care giant Johnson & Johnson expects about $400 million in tariff-related costs this year.  The costs will be felt primarily within the company's medical technology unit, which makes a range of medical devices and surgical products.  The most substantial impact comes from tariffs against China and retaliatory tariffs from China, said Joseph Wolk, Johnson & Johnson's chief financial officer, in a conference call with analysts following the company's latest earnings results. J&J faces several headwinds at the start of the year, including patent expiry, talc litigation, and, now, tariffs. We recently published a list of 10 Best Bargain Stocks to Buy in May. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other best bargain stocks to buy in May. While increasing tariffs and a hard sell-off have resulted in uncertainty, Neuberger Berman, an investment manager, expects […] Brian Thompson’s murder has raised questions about the cost of U.S. healthcare, embroiling insurers, drugmakers and PBMs in a battle for the future of the industry. Johnson & Johnson forecasts about $400 million in costs this year related to tariffs on medical devices, said Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk in an interview.  Wolk said the estimated costs represent a \"worst-case scenario\" and take into account President Trump’s 90-day pause, China's retaliatory tariffs and the resumption of the U.S. tariffs.  J&J isn't doing anything differently yet in response to tariffs, Wolk added. Johnson & Johnson stock fell alongside the broader market, despite beating first-quarter calls and hiking its 2025 sales guidance. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) lifted its full-year operational and reported sales outlook on Tuesday as th Bank of America and Citigroup said consumer spending ticked higher in the first quarter, when concerns about the economy began to bubble up.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand on Monday at a high-stakes trial in Washington over U.S. antitrust enforcers' claims that the company spent billions of dollars to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp to fend off Facebook competitors.  The FTC is seeking to force Meta to restructure or sell Instagram and WhatsApp, testing President Donald Trump's promises to take on Big Tech while posing an existential threat to a company that by some estimates earns about half of its U.S. advertising revenue from Instagram.  Wearing a dark suit and light blue tie, Zuckerberg calmly responded to questions while seeking to combat allegations Meta bought the companies a decade ago to eliminate competition among social media platforms where users connect with friends and family. US telcos will turn up the volume on cost assurance messaging to underline their ability to provide customers with spend certainty as fears grow that the cost of new tariffs will be passed on to US consumers.

We recently published a list of the10 Best Machine Learning Stocks to Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other machine-learning stocks. Grand View Research reported that the global machine-learning market was valued at $36.73 billion in 2022. It’s now expected to grow at a 34.8% CAGR from 2023 to 2030. Machine learning helps machines and systems learn from experience instead of through explicit programming. It uses algorithms to improve and analyze vast amounts of complex data to make informed decisions. Machine learning is quickly progressing as AI is rapidly expanding and transforming how businesses and individuals operate. These technological advancements are revolutionizing consumer experiences, and enabling convenient creation of digital services, products, and optimized supply chains. With this, startups can focus on specific solutions while larger companies can deliver comprehensive AI platforms. On April 10, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the cost of AI and what has to happen to bring it down. Jassy emphasized that the growth in data center demand is now so significant that there is no foreseen attenuation here, even with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties under tariffs. While there’s a general belief that the emergence of DeepSeek could now reduce the need for extensive data centers, processing power, and energy consumption previously forecasted at different tech companies, Jassy thinks that DeepSeek’s introduction did not disrupt any of this. Despite cost reductions that occurred have already over time, AI deployment still requires significant investment. He thinks that the current AI operations are expensive due to chip costs and other factors, but big techs, including his own company, would welcome any reductions in AI costs for customers moving forward. Jassy underscored the demand for data centers despite tariff impacts and reflected optimism regarding lowering costs, which would potentially drive innovation and expanded use of AI across industries. AI is still limited and requires substantial human oversight as of now but it has massive potential across various sectors. We sifted through ETFs and financial media reports to compile a list of the top ML stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on.

Key Points Consider buying these top-notch AI-powered stocks in the current market dip. The global equity markets are highly volatile these days, triggered mainly by ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and trade wars.Artificial intelligence(AI) stocks are also suffering, with many seeing significant corrections in valuations. Yet the long-term growth story of several of these AI-powered stocks, especially those with scalable cutting-edge technologies, is intact. Investors can benefit from this market uncertainty by picking small stakes in high-quality, fundamentally strong AI stocks with sustainable competitive advantages, such asMeta Platforms(META-1.88%),Broadcom(AVGO0.34%), andPalantir Technologies(PLTR6.27%). Here's why buying and holding these stocks over the next decade can be a smart move for retail investors. Meta Platforms' extensive user base exceeds 3.3 billion daily active users across its Family of Apps -- including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Messenger -- granting it unmatched dominance in the global digital advertising landscape. Meta's massive user base gives it access to vast amounts of personalized data. The company analyzes this data with advanced AI algorithms to improve content recommendations on its social media platforms, which helps boost user engagement. This translates into improved ad targeting and higher return on investment for advertisers on its platforms. As more relevant content and products become available on Meta's platforms, it attracts even more customers. This strong network effect results in a sticky user base and an advertiser base for Meta. Meta developed a multifaceted AI strategy, which includes investing in AI applications, AI models, and AI infrastructure. The company's personalized AI assistant, Meta AI, reaches 700 million monthly users. The company also focuses on developing an open-source Llama model series -- an initiative to help draw developers and enterprises to its ecosystem. Meta also planned for $60 billion to $65 billion capital expenditures in 2025, of which a significant portion is for expanding data center capacity. Yet Meta trades at only 22.3 times earnings, below its five-year historical average of 25.3 times. Meanwhile, RBC Capital analysts estimate that the company's earnings will grow annually by 15% to 20% over the long term once Meta has completed its current investments in AI initiatives. Against this backdrop, the current valuation retreat offers an attractive entry point into a company poised to benefit from AI's long-term growth potential in the coming decades. Semiconductor giant Broadcom also transformed itself into an AI powerhouse by focusing on developing custom AI-optimized accelerators (XPUs) for hyperscaler AI workloads. The company offers the next-generation networking infrastructure required for large-scale deployments of AI clusters. Broadcom's acquisition of VMware is highly successful, with 70% of the largest 10,000 customers adopting the VMware Cloud Foundation platform to create virtualized data centers and on-premises private cloud environments. Thanks to the robust hardware-software ecosystem, the company's AI business is thriving, with revenues surging 77% year over year to $4.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending Feb. 2, 2025). The strong AI momentum can continue in the coming years. Management anticipates a serviceable addressable market (SAM) of $60 billion to $90 billion solely from its three major hyperscaler clients by 2027. The company also has four more hyperscalers in the early engagement stage -- which can potentially expand the SAM even more in the coming years. Despite its robust AI business and impressive SAM, Broadcom is trading at 27.8 times forward earnings, far lower than its historical five-year average of 70.7 times. The company's valuation multiples can improve in coming years, considering that analysts expect Broadcom's earnings to grow annually by 26.6% in the long run. Investors can use the current share price pullback as an attractive entry point in this solid growth stock. Data analytics and mining company Palantir offers AI-powered tools and infrastructure to government and commercial clients. Its software analyzes enormous amounts of information across data types and sources to create actionable insights. Palantir's proprietary ontology system (digital frameworks that help relate real-world and digital assets) separates the company from many other AI software companies. Since building robust ontology frameworks takes enormous time and investment, this has become a significant competitive moat for Palantir. With various software solutions, including Gotham, Foundry, and the newly launched Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), the company has effectively established itself as the ontology and AI-powered operating system for the modern enterprise. AIP has also become a significant growth catalyst for the company. Instead of focusing on developing better models, AIP is helping clients deploy AI applications to resolve real-world problems. Palantir's stock is currently down nearly 30% from its all-time high in February 2025. Several factors led to this downfall, including cuts in defense spending, CEO Alex Karp selling an almost $1.9 billion stake since early 2024, and high macroeconomic uncertainty triggered by the U.S. government's tariff policies. Despite this, Palantir stock trades at 161.3 times forward earnings, which is undoubtedly rich. However, growth stocks often trade at very high valuation levels for long time frames. With analysts projecting long-term revenue and earnings growth of 21.4% and 27.7%, respectively, the valuation will also eventually become more reasonable. Despite its contentious valuation, Palantir can prove to be a brilliant addition to an AI-focused investment portfolio -- giving you solid exposure to an enterprise AI software business.

Suited in variations of blue, Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday to defend his company’s past—and fight for its future. The CEO of Meta, Zuckerberg has helmed the company that began as Facebook for more than 20 years. Over the last decade, he’s had to defend his business in Washington, D.C. plenty of times before, from the 2018 Cambridge Analytica hearings to the 2021 Congressional hearings focused on disinformation. But arguably, these are the highest stakes Zuckerberg has faced so far, because what’s on trial is fundamental: The composition of his sprawling, $1.35 trillion market cap business. The FTC has sued Meta, arguing that the social media giant’s acquisitions ofInstagramand WhatsApp more than a decade ago were anti-competitive tactics to eliminate rivals. If Meta loses the case, it could be forced to divest the two apps. The case, which has its roots in the first Trump administration and was carried on by Biden FTC Chair Lina Khan, has travelled a long and winding docket (it was initially dismissed and then refiled) to finally make it to trial—with Zuckerberg as the first witness. While FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson argued that “consumers do not have reasonable alternatives” to Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, Zuckerberg made the case that Meta’s market is far bigger (and more competitive) than the government suggests. On the stand, Zuckerberg dismissed the idea that Facebook was centered on friends, and said that the company had become “more of a broad discovery and entertainment space.” This case, of course, is far bigger than Meta. On some level, it’s existential for the tech landscape as a whole—at least, when it comes to how the industry currently operates. Whether or not the FTC’s claims about Meta’s anticompetitive motives are correct, the underlying business practice—a tech giant swallowing up an innovative startup—is the way the tech ecosystem has been structured to function, and to reward its various participants, over the past several decades. For startups, especially those with limited IPO prospects, dreams of a Big Tech exit have been dim for the last several years—and under the Trump administration, investors and entrepreneurs have been eagerly waiting for M&A to roar back to life. There is some evidence that has been happening—take, for example, Google’s blowoutacquisition of Wiz for $32 billion, announced in March and the largest deal in the search giant’s history. And some in Meta’s camp are no doubt holding out hope that Trump will step in and pressure the FTC to settle the case with Zuckerberg (Meta hascertainly been lobbying the President). But the reality is this: If Meta loses this trial, the Big Tech dealmaking that was beginning to thaw is very likely to freeze back over, affecting the whole ecosystem. For startups, the hopes of exiting to a tech giant will appear grimmer, andliquidity-starved VCswill continue to see exits stall while LPs grow increasingly impatient for returns. Again, none of this is to excuse or condone the monopolistic market concentration that may have been created over time. But given the incentives that are currently built into tech, it does remain natural for giants to look for innovation by acquiring startups. Zuckerberg is expected to take the stand again on Tuesday, and when he does, he won’t just be making the case for his company. He’ll be making the case for Big Tech M&A being allowed to return to its longstanding modus operandi—for better, or for worse.

Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is back in the global spotlight, not over virtual reality or Threads—but its battle with European regulators. And now, Meta CEOMark Zuckerbergreportedly wants help from PresidentDonald Trumpto calm the storm overseas. The Wall Street Journalreported on March 31 that Meta executives are lobbying U.S. trade officials to intervene after the European Commission threatened a cease-and-desist order that could pull the plug on Meta’s ad personalization model in the European Union. That’s a big deal, considering Meta made over $160 billion in ad revenue in 2024, according toStatista.

Meta’s “pay or consent” system, rolled out in November 2023, is at the heart of the issue. It gave European users two choices: pay for ad-free access to Facebook and Instagram or accept targeted ads by consenting to data collection. But regulators weren’t impressed. Meta’s revised pay-or-consent policy didn’t appease the European Consumer Organization either. Its director general,Agustín Reyna, said, “European consumers should not be fooled by the cosmetic changes Meta applies to its one-year-old pay-or consent policy,” according to a Jan. 23statement. The European Commission essentially accused Meta of coercing users into surrendering their data. Reyna added, “In our view, the tech giant fails to address the fundamental issue that Facebook and Instagram users are not being presented with a fair choice and is making a weak bid to argue it is complying with EU law while still pushing users towards its behavioral ads system.” Trending: Invest in the future of digital engagement:Own a piece of the $100 billion Metaverse for just $500. Meta might now be forced to offer completely free versions that avoid detailed user tracking altogether. In accordance with EU’s 2022Digital Markets Act, Meta would potentially pay fines of up to 10% of its annualglobal revenue, which could total around $16.5 billion. Meta disagrees. The company argues that offering subscriptions as an alternative to ads is a standard business model. Meanwhile, theEuropean Commissioninsists that the DMA should be applied equally, no matter where a company is based. But Meta claims this is more than just a legal dispute—economic warfare. According tothe New York Post, a Meta spokesperson said, “This is not just about fines — it’s about the Commission seeking to handicap successful American businesses simply because they’re American while letting Chinese and European rivals off the hook.” See Also: With shares starting at $1.52,this could be your chance to invest in the future of healthcare. ​On April 2, Trump announced sweeping tariffs, including a 10% baseline on all imports and higher, country-specific penalties for “unfair” practices. The 10% tariff took effect on April 5 and remains in place, including for the EU. However, the higher tariffs were suspended for 90 days shortly after their announcement.

We recently published a list ofTop 10 Restaurant Stocks to Buy Under $20. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO) stands against other top restaurant stocks to buy under $20. Restaurant stocks are showing volatility amid Trump’s tariff impositions across various sectors. On April 7, CNBC reported that while US stocks are tumbling due to the effects of high tariffs on the import of goods from key trading partners, analysts do not anticipate the tariffs to hit most restaurant stocks directly. However, inflation is expected to follow behind, fueled by expert and investor fear of an impending recession. This may put pressure on the spending capacity of consumers, resulting in an economic downturn. CNBC reported that UBS analyst Dennis Geiger said the following in a note to clients: “We view the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants as manageable, with a focus on select commodity costs, but see the bigger risk as incremental pressure on consumer spending and industry demand.” CNBC also reported that investor concerns affected restaurant stocks across all sectors. Fast food restaurant chains have historically shown the most resilience during recessions, as consumers looking for cheap dining options typically level down from fast-casual or full-service diners and eateries to fast food options. However, the drop in consumer spending witnessed last year saw fast food restaurants hit hard, as low-income consumers cut their spending to this sector, visiting them less frequently. High-income consumers, on the other hand, continued with their usual dining habits, creating a gap that negatively affected fast food companies. Quick-service restaurants thus underwent same-store sales declines. On March 8, Mario Carbone, Major Food Group chef and co-founder, appeared on CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ to discuss the effects of Trump’s tariffs on the food industry and how high-end consumers are behaving in the sector. Talking about New York, he said that the numbers are booming, going above their pre-Covid benchmarks. New York is thus telling us that everything is good, and there is no fear right now in dining in the luxury sector. Stats are up, and restaurants are packed, with consumer energy through the roof. As of right now, there are no signs of slowing at all if one evaluates the spending and trends in restaurant reports. However, Carbone said that inflation hits the food and restaurant industry just like everyone else. The luxury food sector is responsible to the customer for bringing in the best ingredients for every meal, which is why it has no choice but to pass the effects on to the consumer in case such trends materialize. We sifted through stock screeners, financial media reports, and ETFs to compile a list of 20 restaurant stocks under $20 as of April 13, 2025, and chose the top 10 most popular among hedge funds as of Q4 2024. The list is ordered in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey’s database.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of customers ordering from a McDonald's restaurant in Latin America. Share Price: $7.22 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21 Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO) is a McDonald’s franchisee operating or franchising more than 2,140 McDonald’s-branded restaurants. Its operations are divided into four geographical categories: Brazil, the Carribean, the North Latin America division (NOLAD), and the South Latin America division (SLAD). Analysts believe that Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc.’s (NYSE:ARCO) stock provides an attractive entry point. The company holds a competitive market edge due to its restaurant portfolio. More than half of its restaurants are free-standing units, which provide a mix of takeout, drive-thru, and delivery service options and boost restaurant sales. On October 1, 2024, the company announced that it would exercise its option to renew its Master Franchise Agreement (MFA) with McDonald’s for another 20 years starting in 2025. This agreement has strengthened the company’s strategic footing, which stems from the geographic diversification of its solid restaurant base throughout Latin America. On April 1, BTG Pactual initiated coverage of Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO) with a Buy rating and a $10.50 price target. Analysts have bullish sentiments for the stock, and their median price target of $7.22 implies an upside of 45.43% from current levels. Brennan Asset Management stated the following regarding Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO) in its Q4 2024 investorletter: “Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO): Rough 2024…Shares Substantially Undervalued: ARCO produced solid operating results throughout 2024, but negative currency movements, including a near freefall in the Brazilian Real (over 20 percent decline), drove investors to dump ARCO shares. As we noted in our Q3 letter, ARCO announced that it renewed its master franchise agreement (MFA) with McDonald’s (MCD) at terms that were better than many anticipated. While we won’t rehash the entire ARCO thesis (see our 2023 Q2 and Q3 letters for more color), we continue to believe that ARCO is a unique asset (the license to operate essentially all MCD restaurants from Mexico south) that was turbocharged by COVID’s aftereffects. During and after COVID, a large percentage of restaurants closed and there was rapid adoption of drive-through and delivery sales. ARCO disproportionately benefited, given its larger share of free-standing stores. ARCO has a strong balance sheet (including substantial real-estate value), strong incremental returns on capital and a substantial growth opportunity. Brazil faces macro challenges, and further currency weakness is distinctly possible. That said, ARCO has a history of achieving same[1]store sale growth above inflation rates and Brazil has some of the highest delivery penetration rates and digital adaptation rates in all of LATAM. Furthermore, there is no reason for ARCO not to move its listing from New York to Sao Paulo and greatly neutralize the reporting impact from currency fluctuations. We strongly believe ARCO is mispriced at current levels.” Overall, ARCOranks 6thon our list of the top restaurant stocks to buy under $20. While we acknowledge the potential for ARCO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.CMG stock's premium valuation — trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 36.81X — has raised eyebrows, especially as the restaurant industry braces for potential disruption from renewed trade tensions and tariff threats. The stock is trading above the Zacks Retail-Restaurant industry’s average of 25.12X and the broader Retail-Wholesale sector’s 22.11X.The warning signals come as restaurant chains, including peers likeBrinker International, Inc.EAT,McDonald's CorporationMCD andYum! Brands, Inc.YUM face dual threats: slowing discretionary spending and geopolitical risk. Looming macroeconomic risks, concerns around inflation, retaliatory tariffs, and rising labor costs are beginning to cast a shadow over CMG’s near-term prospects. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research So far this year, shares of Chipotle have declined 18.1% compared with the Zacks Retail – Restaurants industry’s fall of 1.5%. The stock has underperformed the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s and the S&P 500’s declines of 5.7% and 8.4%, respectively. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research From a technical perspective, Chipotle stock is currently trading below its 50-day moving average, signaling a bearish trend. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Analysts and investors alike are starting to question how sustainable Chipotle’s momentum is under these conditions. Let’s find out. Macro Pressures Are Building:The broader economic environment is starting to catch up with even the most resilient players. Inflation remains sticky, interest rates are still elevated, and consumers are becoming more price-conscious. As a premium fast-casual brand, Chipotle is particularly vulnerable to this shift.Declining profitability remains a concern for CMG. During the fourth quarter of 2024, Restaurant-level margins contracted 60 basis points year over year to 24.8%, weighed down by rising input costs and portion-related investments. Despite promises of back-half relief from initiatives like produce slicers and back-of-house modernization, management expects margin pressure to linger into the first half of 2025.While many restaurant chains are seeing signs of consumer trade-down behavior, Chipotle has continued to raise menu prices to offset inflationary pressures. This strategy worked well during earlier waves of inflation, but there are signs that consumer tolerance for higher prices may be peaking. The brand's value perception is at risk, especially as grocery inflation moderates and home cooking becomes a more attractive alternative for budget-minded customers. Tariff Troubles on the Horizon:Chipotle may also find itself caught in the crosshairs of geopolitical trade friction. With about 2% of Chipotle’s product cost tied to imports from Mexico — including avocados, tomatoes and peppers — the newly announced tariffs could shave an additional 60 basis points off margins if implemented fully. While management has done commendable work diversifying suppliers, the risk remains non-trivial. A spike in input costs could pressure margins and force further price hikes, which may not be well received by customers already feeling the pinch.Other major chains like Brinker, YUM! Brands and McDonald's have acknowledged the potential impact of tariffs, suggesting broader industry-wide implications. Chipotle, despite its nimbleness, is not immune to these macro-level risks. Chipotle’s 2025 earnings per share (EPS) estimates have been revised downward, dropping from $1.29 to $1.27 over the past 60 days. This downward trend reflects weakening analyst confidence in the stock’s near-term prospects. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Nevertheless, the company is likely to report strong earnings, with projections indicating 13.4% year-over-year growth in 2025. Conversely, industry players like Brinker, YUM! Brands and McDonald's are likely to witness a rise of 102.7%, 9.3% and 4.5%, year over year, respectively. Despite the concerns, Chipotle is not without its strengths. The company continues to set itself apart by focusing on high-quality, customizable food served quickly in a clean and consistent environment. As part of its broader strategy, Chipotle is doubling down on speed and service through operational upgrades and managerial stability, which are helping drive strong customer loyalty and higher transaction volumes.To further elevate the customer experience, Chipotle has made significant investments in digital innovation and restaurant design. With digital orders now accounting for more than a third of its sales, the company’s mobile app and “Chipotlane” drive-thru pickup windows are creating faster, more convenient ways for customers to engage with the brand. These enhancements not only increase average check sizes but also boost efficiency, contributing to stronger unit economics and improving throughput during peak hours.On the sourcing side, Chipotle has taken early steps to mitigate tariff risk by diversifying avocado suppliers beyond Mexico. While not a full hedge, it does reduce exposure relative to less-prepared peers. Additionally, the brand’s focus on automation and kitchen innovation could help offset wage inflation and maintain unit economics.Chipotle is also positioning itself for global expansion, with promising early traction in Canada, Europe, and the Middle East. By tailoring its strategy for international markets while maintaining its core values, the company is showing that its model can travel. Domestically, it continues to pursue its goal of reaching 7,000 locations, backed by strong unit economics and growing average unit volumes. Together, these efforts are positioning Chipotle for long-term margin expansion and sustainable growth. Analysts maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook on Chipotle’s stock. Based on short-term price targets from 31 analysts, the average price target is $64.84, suggesting a potential upside of 31.1% from the last closing price of $49.46. Price forecasts range from a low of $48.00, indicating a 2.95% downside risk, to a high of $72.00, which represents a possible 45.6% upside. Meanwhile, Chipotle carries a solid average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.52 on a scale of 1 (Strong Buy) to 5 (Strong Sell), reflecting a favorable consensus. Among 32 brokerage firms, 22 analysts rate the stock as a Strong Buy and three as a Buy, underscoring confidence in Chipotle’s growth potential. Chipotle remains a strong brand within the fast-casual dining space, backed by its commitment to food quality, digital innovation, and long-term expansion plans. Despite current macroeconomic pressures, including inflation, rising labor costs, and looming tariff threats, the company’s proactive steps — such as supplier diversification, automation, and a focus on customer experience — highlight its operational agility and long-term vision. Continued digital investment and international expansion further strengthen its position for future growth. That said, Chipotle’s elevated valuation and recent underperformance relative to its industry and broader market introduce caution into the near-term outlook. Margin pressure, waning consumer tolerance for price hikes and geopolitical uncertainties could weigh on earnings and sentiment in the coming quarters. The stock’s downward earnings estimate revisions and technical weakness add to investment hesitancy. Given these dynamics, existing investors may consider holding on to this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock as Chipotle works through short-term headwinds and executes its strategic initiatives. However, new investors might find it wise to remain on the sidelines until macro risks moderate and momentum begins to recover, especially considering the stock’s premium valuation and recent volatility.

      "date": "2025-04-15 13:00:36",

      "content": "Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Chili’s is ratcheting up its fightagainst fast food rivalswith a new cheeseburger that might make McDonald’s call their lawyers. The chain is rolling out Tuesday the Big QP burger, which not only has a similar name to McDonald’s Quarter Pounder but also the same toppings: two slices of American cheese, pickles, ketchup and diced onions. Chili’s says in a press release that its version has 85% more beef, making it “even more value-packed” than the fast food classic. The Big QP is being added to Chili’s popular “3 for Me,” a $10.99 meal that includes the burger, fries, unlimited chips and free refills of a soft drink. The deal exploded in popularity last year when Chili’s took aim at customers of its fast food rivals (notably McDonald’s)  who might be turned off by theirrising prices. And while the meal might be more expensive than a McDonald’s Quarter Pounder, which costs around $5 to $7 depending on the city, it’s comparable in price to a combo meal with medium fries and medium-sized soft drink. Chili’s directly jabbed McDonald’s in its press release, calling the $10.99 deal “less expensive than a comparable meal at McDonald’s” as well as releasing TV ads that call the Quarter Pounder “tiny.” The Big QP is the second McDonald’s-inspired burger from Chili’s. Last year, the chain added a Big Mac-like burger called the Big Smasher, rolling out acheeky ad campaignthat directlycalled out the Big Mac. Ultimately, that proved a successful gambit, with the Big Smasher helping Chili’s register a 15% jump in same-store sales following its release. Chili’s is likely hoping to sustain its skyrocketing sales by continuing this rivalry. Sales in its most recent quarter jumped 31%, marking the chain’s third-straight quarter of double-digit growth. Shares of Brinker International (EAT), its parent company, have soared 200% over the past year. Related articleChili’s and Applebee’s are fighting about their value meals Once trailing flashier rivals, Chili’s ispulling off its comebackthanks to these deals, plus revamped chicken tender recipes and viral TikToks of its “Triple Dipper” appetizer. The chain also recently opened a location in Scranton, Pennsylvaniainspired by “The Office.” This success stands in contrast to most casual dining chains. Typically catering to lower and middle-income families looking for a sit-down meal, diners have been abandoning these companies in recent years.These restaurantshave been hiking menu prices at the same time their customer base is being squeezed by the rising cost of living, resulting in several bankruptcies, including Hooters, TGI Fridays and Buca di Beppo. Although McDonald’s hasn’t directly responded to Chili’s, the chain recently added a“McValue” menu categoryin hopes of turning around its sluggish sales. In addition to the$5 meal deal, the menu also has a “Buy One, Add One for $1” option and more locally targeted promotions from its franchises. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

We recently published a list of10 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires. The market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump’s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year. The year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios. In the second month of 2025, the US government’s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States’ tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services. DW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods & services in the latest round of “Trump Tariffs”. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering “continuous stagflation”, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment. This scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children’s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children’s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President & CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing: “Make sure that money can be talked about, that there’s no taboos…so that your children are learning those really good financial literacy skills that they need to set themselves up for success for the rest of their life.” Investing in the markets for your children’s future has the advantage of time. In a report by MorningStar, investments in stocks have the added benefit of compounding return, which means the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to grow exponentially. CNBC reported on billionaire investor Mark Cuban and how he made billions from his first few million with a long-term view on his investments. To compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources and gathered the stocks they collectively favored.

Then, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database of billionaire stock holdings to arrive at our list of 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires as of Q4 2024. For the stocks with the same number of billionaire holdings, we have used the total value of billionaire holdings as a secondary metric to rank the stocks.

The Nasdaq Composite, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 7.3%, 5.7% and 5%, respectively. Throughout the week, trade was influenced by tariff reprieves announced on European goods and a trade war between the United States and China.

For March, inflation numbers both on the consumer and producer side came in negative, against expectations. Consumer sentiments, however, have declined further, and all eyes are currently set on developments from the White House and its multi-front tariff war.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research  Over the past three months, MCD shares have gained 13% compared the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry’s 0.6% rise. Over the same period, the stock has fared better than the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s 6.9% dip and the S&P 500 index’s 9.3% decline.  Image Source: Zacks Investment Research  The MCD stock has outperformed some industry players in the past three months, includingRestaurant Brands International Inc.QSR,The Wendy's CompanyWEN andChipotle Mexican GrillCMG. In the said time frame, shares of Restaurant Brands have gained 4.2%, while Wendy's and Chipotle have tumbled 12.6% and 14%, respectively.Can McDonald's recent performance signal a continued upward trajectory? Let us explore the key factors that can drive the stock's growth and strengthen investor confidence in the near term. MCD is focused on expanding its global presence, aiming to enhance growth through the latest openings and upgrades to existing locations. This strategy supports the company’s continued performance despite challenging conditions. In 2024, McDonald's opened 2,116 restaurants, an increase from 2,067 in 2023. This growth reflects the company’s focus on expanding its global footprint through the Restaurant Development pillar of its Accelerating the Arches Strategy.Going forward, McDonald's aims to accelerate its pace of restaurant openings to meet growing demand across key markets. In 2025, the company plans to open 2,200 restaurants globally, contributing more than 4% to new unit growth, net of closures. It continues to build on its industry-leading development, targeting 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027, marking the fastest growth phase in its history. McDonald's continues to strengthen its brand by enhancing core menu offerings and improving customer experience. With a focus on value, variety and operational efficiency, the company is working to boost customer engagement and drive long-term growth. In January 2025, MCD launched the McValue platform in the United States, designed to provide customers with more flexible options and consistent value.MCD is enhancing its delivery services to provide greater convenience and improve the customer experience. With an emphasis on expanding delivery options and strengthening digital capabilities, the company is focused on creating seamless ways for customers to access its offerings.Over the past year, the delivery sales mix has doubled in Australia, Canada and the United States. McDonald's expects to increase the percentage of system-wide delivery sales originating from its mobile app to 30% by 2027. McDonald's is leveraging its loyalty program and digital initiatives to drive customer retention and expand its base. By enhancing the customer experience across multiple channels, the company is creating more value for loyalty members and increasing engagement through innovative digital solutions.Since launching its loyalty program, MCD has seen significant growth, with more than 170 million 90-day active users. In 2024, sales to loyalty members reached $30 billion. With the continued rise in digital adoption, McDonald's is optimistic about the long-term success of its loyalty program. The company expects to expand its active user base to 250 million and achieve $45 billion in annual sales by 2027.  Image Source: Zacks Investment Research  Analysts are becoming more optimistic about MCD’s earnings outlook. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for McDonald's 2025 EPS has increased from $12.23 to $12.25, implying a 4.5% year-over-year increase. The momentum is set to continue into 2026, with earnings anticipated to climb 8.2% year over year to $13.25 per share. McDonald's is currently valued at a premium compared with its industry on a forward 12-month price-to-earnings basis. The company’s forward 12-month P/E ratio stands at 25.21X, slightly higher than the industry’s average of 25.12X. The premium valuation reflects the company’s consistent performance, strong position in key markets and earnings growth potential. Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands, Wendy's and Chipotle are trading at P/E ratios of 16.61X, 12.83X, and 36.81X, respectively.  Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Given MCD's strong global expansion strategy, focus on menu innovation and digital initiatives, the company is well-positioned for continued growth. Restaurant openings, digital enhancements and the successful loyalty program show promising long-term prospects.However, the company is facing challenges with weaker comparable store sales growth, as global comps edged down 0.1% in 2024 against 9% growth in the prior year. Additionally, macroeconomic uncertainty and market volatility could weigh on short-term performance.Considering McDonald's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), investors may want to stay cautious while monitoring the company's ability to capitalize on its growth opportunities in the coming quarters.

We recently published a list of10 Best Bargain Stocks to Buy in May. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best bargain stocks to buy in May. While increasing tariffs and a hard sell-off have resulted in uncertainty, Neuberger Berman, an investment manager, expects that negotiations can bring some relief to initial tariff proposals. Furthermore, the firm anticipates a sharply slower growth than a US recession. Also, it believes that stimulus in Europe and China can rejuvenate global industrial activity, and the firm recommends styles, sectors, and regions that are most geared to it. Given that a significant amount of tariff shock has now been priced in, Neuberger Berman is constructive on global equities for the remainder of the year. The firm expects that an ongoing recovery in the global industrial economy might be dampened but not derailed. The underlying momentum in the goods economy is expected to support equities that are most levered to it. Furthermore, the firm prefers value over growth (which is relatively expensive) and small caps over large caps. While an overdose of growth-inhibiting policy can impact the relatively healthy economy and push it into recession, the investment management firm believes that the US hasn’t yet reached that point. As per the firm, performance during the decline demonstrates relative strength in some of the more cyclical economic sectors in the US and around the world. The goods-oriented sectors, regions, and styles continue to outperform amidst the recent sell-off. READ ALSO:7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Termand8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. S&P Global expects inflation to remain closer to 3.0% in 2025 as tariffs raise the prices along the domestic supply chain as well as for the end consumers. For 2026, the firm expects growth to pick up after a slow start. This is because of the abatement of uncertainty associated with the structure of tariffs and the further easing of the policy rate by the Federal Reserve. Also, the growth is expected to be aided partly because of a more favorable growth backdrop in the eurozone, which can help expand US exports. Neuberger Berman opines that a combination of improving fundamentals and stabilizing risks increased the optimism in the energy sector. As per the firm, increased global industrial activity is expected to continue to buoy oil demand and keep prices aloft. Furthermore, energy seems to be the most undervalued sector in the S&P 500 relative to the current and expected earnings growth. The investment management firm believes that much of the negative news, including regulatory concerns and geopolitical risks, seem to be factored in. This suggests that energy stocks can increase as the sentiment improves.

We are yet to get first-quarter 2025 results from the energy companies, with the oil-energy sector’s earnings season to start this week. In the meantime,Exxon Mobil CorporationXOM has already offered an early glimpse of how the quarter might have shaped up. As oil and natural gas prices were buoyant in the March quarter, we expectBP plcBP andSLBSLB to beat on first-quarter earnings. Per the data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), the average Cushing, OK WTI spot prices for January, February, and March of this year were $75.74, $71.53 and $68.24 per barrel, respectively. Thus, the overall pricing environment was favorable in the first quarter of 2025, as the breakeven costs of the exploration and production companies in the shale plays are significantly lower. However, although crude prices were advantageous in the March quarter of this year, the overall prices of the commodity were a bit higher at $74.15, $77.25 and $81.28 per barrel in January, February and March of 2024, respectively. Hence, the oil-energy sector is likely to have generated lower total earnings in the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the prior-year quarter. Our data suggests that in the March quarter of 2025, the sector will probably generate total earnings of $27.5 billion, lower than $30.5 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Notably, the pricing scenario for natural gas was not only healthier but also favorable in the first quarter of 2025. Since the prices of both crude oil and natural gas were favorable for exploration and production activities, upstream energy players will likely report handsome first-quarter results. Oilfield service players will also likely remain in the sweet spot since they help upstream firms set up oil and gas wells effectively. XOM, one of the largest integrated energy players, recently reported in an SEC filing that it expects its upstream earnings for the March quarter to increase sequentially by as much as $800 million. The company attributed advantageous oil and gas prices for the improvement. Moreover, ExxonMobil expects its Energy Products business unit to witness a sequential improvement of $300-$700 million owing to the changes in industry margins. With the existence of a number of players in the sector, finding the right energy stocks that have the potential to beat on earnings can be daunting. Our proprietary methodology, however, makes it fairly simple. You could narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), and a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. SLB SLB is a leading oilfield service player. As exploration and production activities were favorable, SLB is likely to have witnessed increased demand for its well construction, completions and reservoir characterization activities. SLB currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and a Zacks Rank of 3. It is slated to report first-quarter 2025 results on April 25. The company's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 1.78%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.) Image Source: Zacks Investment Research BP BP, a British energy giant, currently has an Earnings ESP of +9.14% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. Supportive commodity prices are likely to have aided BP. The company is slated to report first-quarter 2025 results on April 29. However, BP expects its production from upstream operations to be lower sequentially. BP’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters and missed in the other two, delivering an average negative surprise of 3.04%.

Key Points The stock market has sold off sharply this year, with theS&P 500(^GSPC-0.17%)recently down about 10% since 2025 began. While stock market sell-offs can be tough to stomach, there is a silver lining to downturns. Stock prices and dividend yields have an inverse relationship. So, as a stock's price falls, its dividend yield rises.Because of that, you can cash in on a stock market sell-off by locking in higher yields on some topdividend stocks. ExxonMobil(XOM-0.34%),PepsiCo(PEP-2.69%), andPrologis(PLD-0.07%)currently offer dividend yields of around 4%, which aregreatlevels for these elite dividend stocks. Shares ofExxonMobilhave tumbled more than 15% from their high point earlier this year. That slump has driven the oil giant's dividend yieldupto around 4%. That's much higher than the dividend yield on the S&P 500 (around 1.4%). ExxonMobil increased its dividend payment by 4% earlier this year. That extended its annual dividend growth streak to 42 straight years -- a track record achieved by only 4% of companies in the S&P 500. The oil company is in a strong position to continue growing its dividend.It produced $34.4 billion in free cash flowlast year, easily covering its $16.7 billion dividend outlay.Meanwhile, the company has a fortress-like balance sheet with an ultra-lowleverage ratioof 6% and $23.2 billion of cash. Exxon is working on a strategy to increase its annual cash flows by $30 billion by 2030. It plans to remove billions of dollars in structural costs from its business and invest heavily in growing its highest-margin production. That should give it plenty of fuel to continue raising its dividend in the future. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is800%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500. They just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now… *Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025 PepsiCo stock is down nearly 10% from its peak earlier this year.That has driven up the beverage and snacking giant's dividend yield to 3.8%,based on its current dividend payment.The company has already announced that it will increase its dividend payment by another 5% starting in June. That puts itsforward dividend yieldright around 4%. That dividend increase extends PepsiCo's growth streak to 53 straight years. It will keep the company in the elite group ofDividend Kings: companies with 50 or more years of increasing their dividend payments. PepsiCo is in a strong position to continue growing its dividend. The beverage and snacking giant produces lots of cash. It generated $12.5 billion in net cash from operating activities last year -- more than enough to cover its $7.6 billionindividend payments. PepsiCo also has a strong cash-rich balance sheet (nearly $9.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments). The company uses its strong excess free cash flow to invest in organicallygrowingits business and make acquisitions (it recently agreed to buy Poppi for $1.7 billion), which should support continued dividend growth. Prologis stock has lost nearly a quarter of its value this year. That sell-off has drivenupthe real estate investment trust's (REIT) dividend yield to around 4.3%. The leading industrial REIT has a great record of growing its dividend. It has increased its payout for 12 straight years while growing it at a 13% compound annual rate over the past five years. That's an elite rate, as it's more than double the pace of the S&P 500 (5%) and REIT sector average (also5%). Prologis is in an excellent position to continue increasing its dividend.The industrial REIT has one of thestrongest balance sheets in the sector, which allowsit to invest in development projects and make accretive acquisitions. Meanwhile, it's benefiting from strong demand for logistics real estate from catalysts like the growing adoption of e-commerce. Prologisis also usingsome of its vast landbankto develop data centers, providing it with an additional growth catalyst. The stock market sell-offis providinginvestors with the opportunity to cash in by buying high-quality dividend stocks and locking in their higher yields. That positions investors to generate more income in the future, boosting their total return potential.

We recently published a list of the11 Best Dividend Paying Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best dividend-paying stocks. Dividend-paying stocks have consistently attracted investor interest due to their long-term value. CNBC highlights this by examining the historical performance of the broader market. Between 1960 and 2024, a $10,000 investment in the index would have grown to over $982,000 purely from stock price appreciation, based on data from FactSet and NYU Stern. However, many companies in the index also returned capital to shareholders through dividends. Had an investor reinvested those dividends over the years, the investment would have ballooned to approximately $6.42 million by the beginning of 2025. This outlook seems reasonable, especially when considering how crucial cash flow has become in today’s economic environment. Investors continue to favor income-generating assets, and dividends remain one of the most reliable ways to deliver that income. Reflecting this trend, several companies within the market have recently introduced dividend payments. According to S&P Global, companies in the S&P index now contribute roughly 85% of the total dividends paid across the market—up from 82% in 2024. This increase includes 2.7% of the total dividend pool coming from firms that only recently began issuing dividends. The top 29 companies in the index alone are responsible for 40% of all dividends paid by the index’s constituents and 35% of the total dividends across the entire US equity market. Under the current base-case forecast, these leading firms are expected to distribute a combined $280 billion in dividends. In a more optimistic (upside) scenario, that figure could climb by 2.75% to $288 billion, with major large cap companies projected to deliver the most significant gains by weighted average. If the most favorable (bull-case) conditions materialize, these 29 companies could boost total dividend payouts by an estimated 4.5%, contributing an additional 1% themselves. It’s no surprise, then, that dividends have become a central theme in many investors’ strategies. According to Brian Bollinger, founder of Simply Safe Dividends, focusing on companies that regularly pay dividends can offer a sense of reassurance. He further noted that younger investors, in particular, have the opportunity to build long-term dividend growth portfolios aimed at maximizing total return and capital appreciation over time. According to Nuveen, companies that focus on dividend growth tend to possess strong long-term fundamentals and may deliver relatively attractive performance in the year ahead. Historically, firms that consistently increased or initiated dividend payments have produced higher annualized returns and exhibited lower volatility compared to the broader equity market. While such companies may not lead in every market environment, their favorable risk-adjusted returns over extended periods make them a solid foundation for equity portfolios. Nuveen also suggested that many firms remain in a strong position to continue raising dividends over time. In the US, corporate balance sheets are generally healthy, consumer spending remains steady, and earnings growth is projected to pick up pace in 2025. Data from FactSet shows that dividends per share for the S&P index rose by 7.6% in 2024, with consensus forecasts pointing to a further 4.2% increase in 2025. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Aerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil. Our Methodology: For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of the close of Q4 2024. From the top 60 companies, we selected 11 dividend stocks with yields of at least 1% as of April 12. These companies show strong financial performance and have solid records of paying dividends. The stocks are ranked according to the number of hedge funds having stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104 An American multinational oil and gas company, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is a global leader in integrated energy and chemical operations, ranks at the top of the best oil and gas dividend stocks to consider. In Q4 2024, the company reported a revenue of $83.4 billion, reflecting a slight 1.1% dip from the previous year. Despite this, its long-term performance remained steady, supported by $12.1 billion in structural cost savings since 2019. These efforts have helped offset inflation and expansion costs while enabling it to outperform industry peers. For 2024, the company recorded a sector-leading return on capital employed at 12.7%, with a five-year average of 10.8%. With a strong cash flow position, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands out as a reliable dividend payer. It generated $55 billion in operating cash flow during 2024, marking its third-strongest year in the past decade. For Q4 alone, operating cash flow reached $12.2 billion, while free cash flow totaled $8 billion. The company returned $36 billion to shareholders in 2024, including $16.7 billion in dividend payments. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) boasts a rich dividend legacy, having paid shareholders for 143 consecutive years and growing its dividend consistently for the past 42 years. Currently, it pays a quarterly dividend of $0.99 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.84%, as of April 12. Overall, XOMranks 6thon our list of the best dividend paying stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about thedirt cheap dividend stock.

Key Points Last week's rally in the broader stock market indexes sprung theNasdaq Composite(^IXIC-0.05%)back upward after a more than 20% that technically put it into a bear market. However, it's apparent that market volatility may be far from over. Income investors looking at the current landscape may be wondering if now is the best time to buydividend stocksgiven the wild swings to the upside and the downside. Here are some risks worth considering before buying dividend stocks and whyExxonMobil(XOM-0.34%)is a good example of a dividend stock that you can buy with confidence during a bear market. Image source: Getty Images. Investors who use dividends for financial planning or to supplement income in retirement will want to target companies with reliable payouts. After all, what good is a dividend if a company cuts it at the slightest sign of economic uncertainty? ExxonMobil has raised its dividend for42 consecutive years-- which may come as a surprise given the ups and downs in the oil and gas industry. In the last decade alone, there was the crash of 2014 and 2015 and the plunge during the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, ExxonMobil reported its worst year on record in 2020 -- a staggering $22.4 billion loss. Even during a period of high uncertainty and a collapse in the global economy, ExxonMobil kept its dividend streak alive in 2020 because it relied on the strength of its balance sheet. ExxonMobil's balance sheet is in its best shape in over a decade. ExxonMobil's net total long-term debt position is just $14.7 billion, which is small for a company of its size. Its financial debt-to-equity ratio of 0.08 and debt-to-capital ratio of 12.5% showcase how the company has reduced its dependence on debt and can rely on free cash flow to fund operating expenses and long-term investments. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is800%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500. They just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now… *Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025 In fact, ExxonMobil has the lowest debt-to-capital ratio of the major integrated U.S. and European oil and gas companies -- a close second being its U.S. peerChevron.  BP Debt To Capital (Quarterly)data byYCharts ExxonMobil can support its dividend even if margins fall due to lower oil and gas prices. The company has considerably improved its cost structure and technological advancements that havereduced production costs. ExxonMobil has a long-term plan through 2030 built around Brent (the international benchmark) crude oil prices averaging $65 per barrel. However, it also has an optimistic scenario at $85 Brent and a pessimistic outcome at $55 per barrel. Even at $55 per barrel, ExxonMobil expects to earn acash surplus of $110 billion from 2025 to 2030thanks to higher free cash flow from its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, development of onshore assets in the Permian Basin, production expansion offshore Guyana, and other moves. Brent crude oil prices averaged $81 per barrel in 2024 but have fallen in recent weeks due to tariff tensions, production increases in the Middle East, and recession fears. Brent crude oil is at a three-year low of around $63.60 at the time of this writing. But again, even at this level, the dividend is manageable -- although ExxonMobil may pull back on near-term capital expenditures if prices stay low. The third risk worth considering before scooping up shares of dividend stocks during a bear market is whether the company can endure a prolonged slowdown. Or, in this case, tariffs. Dividend affordability and a strong balance sheet are part of the equation, but so are competitive advantages. ExxonMobil can profit from its oil and gas production portfolio even at lower prices. Unlike some pure-play companies, ExxonMobil isn't dependent on a single geographic region. ExxonMobil also has a massive refining business and a growing low-carbon division. So, in the event of a slowdown, the company should bewell positioned to take market shareor even pounce on an acquisition opportunity. Not all dividend-paying companies have ExxonMobil's advantages. Some companies had strained balance sheets heading into 2025. Others have a dividend expense that is alreadyeating up the bulk of profits. So, for these companies, if profits come down and stay down for too long, there could be pressure for a dividend cut. Dividends are an excellent way to collect passive income no matter what stock prices are doing -- allowing investors to book a return without having to sell stock. But a dividend is only as reliable as the company paying it. Despite operating in the cyclical oil and gas industry, ExxonMobil is a beacon of dividend reliability. With a yield of 4%, ExxonMobil is an excellent way to generate a sizable amount of passive income while staying invested in the market.

We recently published a list of the11 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other undervalued energy stocks. On March 18, Tortoise Capital senior portfolio manager Rob Thummel appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ to discuss his outlook on the energy sector. He believes that natural gas is positioned to lead growth in the future within the energy sector. This natural gas demand is driven by electricity and energy exports. Thummel noted that the energy and tech sectors are converging due to advancements like AI and data centers. Electricity demand fuels natural gas consumption, while US energy exports help meet global needs for low-cost and low-carbon energy. He also highlighted that the US is now emerging as the largest exporter of LNG, even though it was an LNG importer just years ago. He anticipates that the US LNG exports will soon 2x in volume over time. Thummel also expects Europe and other countries to prioritize energy security and diversify their supply sources. This will ensure reliance on US energy exports. Thummel emphasized a focus on energy infrastructure companies while discussing his specific investment strategies as they tend to be stable and have high dividend yields even in uncertain market conditions. He thinks that the certainty provided by energy infrastructure investments in an otherwise volatile market should not be neglected. Such companies generate substantial annual cash flows while maintaining disciplined financial practices. Thummel thinks that the energy sector trades at a discount to historical valuations despite its fundamentals. This offers the potential for high returns. We used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top energy stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15 as of April 10. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

It’s also pursuing lower-emission and other business opportunities, such as carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, lower-emission fuels, Proxxima systems, carbon materials, and lithium. The acquisition of Pioneer assets has strengthened the company’s position in the Permian basin. In 2024, the company achieved record production from both its Heritage ExxonMobil assets and the newly acquired Pioneer assets. The combined strength of these assets is projected to yield an average of more than $3 billion per year in synergies. Production is expected to increase from 1.5 million oil-equivalent barrels per day at the end of 2024 to 2.3 million barrels per day by 2030. This represents ~50% growth. The Permian Basin is a key contributor to Exxon Mobil Corp.’s (NYSE:XOM) overall upstream portfolio, which achieved the highest-ever production from its advantaged assets and the highest liquid production from its overall portfolio in more than 40 years. The company’s focus on low-cost supply, low emissions intensity, and high returns in the Permian ensures that this segment will continue to drive growth.

We recently published a list of the10 Best Oil Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best oil stocks. After an encouraging start to the year, the energy sector is once again lagging behind the overall market. At the time of writing this piece, the broader energy sector has slid by almost 8.2% since the beginning of 2025, against declines of around 7.9% by the wider market. The principal reason behind this fall is the decline in the global prices of oil, which have plunged by almost 14.5% since the beginning of the year. READ NEXT:10 Best Clean Energy Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires The continued uncertainty surrounding the ongoing tariff war and the recent decision by OPEC+ to increase supply in May have taken a toll on the global price, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price now hovering around a 3-year low of $61.5. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecasted WTI price to average $63.88 per barrel for 2025 before dropping to an average of $57.48 next year. Such a sharp decline in prices could threaten US oil production growth this year. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the US oil industry needs prices between $61 and $70 per barrel to be profitable. The escalating trade tensions between the US and China have also raised the prospect of a global economic slowdown, potentially leading to a lower-than-forecasted consumption of oil. In its latest report, the EIA now expects global oil consumption to increase by 900,000 b/d in 2025 and 1 million b/d in 2026, down by 400,000 b/d and 100,000 b/d, respectively, from its initial forecast last month. The decrease in demand, coupled with increasing production, will continue putting pressure on crude prices, forcing many industry players to cut back activity to maintain investor payouts. The American oil and gas sector is also frustrated by the back and forth trade policies of President Trump and is questioning how they align with his ‘drill, baby, drill’ mandate to further boost production. According to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, nearly a third of oil executives have stated that their business outlook has worsened since the end of 2024. Moreover, the imposition of the 25% tariff on steel and aluminum has already led to an estimated 4% increase in costs for drilling a well. The pressing issues surrounding the global oil trade have forced the industry to shift focus to its second major source of revenue – natural gas. In contrast to oil, the benchmark US natural gas price at Henry Hub has surged by more than 123% since last year and by almost 18% since the beginning of 2025. The uptick comes as a result of slowing output in 2024, booming LNG exports, and fast-depleting inventories during the coldest winter in six years. Moreover, natural gas has emerged as a leading candidate to power the ongoing AI boom and its accompanying data centers, with many providers now even aiming to surpass utilities and supply directly to these power-hungry facilities. Also, despite the broad concerns, many billionaires continue to invest and remain bullish on the oil sector. A great example is how Warren Buffett’sBerkshire Hathawaymaintains significant holdings in multiple oil majors and even recently invested hundreds of millions of dollars in an oil and gas giant over the last few months. Aerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil. To collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of billionaires’ stock holdings and picked the top 10 companies operating in the oil sector with the highest number of billionaire investors in the Insider Monkey database in Q4 of 2024. When two or more companies had the same number of billionaires backing them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year. Following are theBest Oil Stocks According to Billionaires.

Number of Billionaire Holders: 16 Topping our list of theBest Oil Stocks According to Billionairesis Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), one of the largest integrated fuels, lubricants, and chemical companies in the world. The company operates facilities or markets products around the globe and explores for oil and natural gas on six continents. After the $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources last year, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)’s production in the Permian Basin and Guyana hit a record high in 2024. The oil major delivered an industry-leading financial performance last year, with $34 billion in earnings and $55 billion in cash flow from operations, its third-highest result in a decade despite softer market conditions. The company’s total production came in at 4.3 million boed in 2024, with a target to achieve close to 5.4 million boed in 2030. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has grown its earnings at an annual rate of roughly 30% over the last five years, while its cash flow has increased at a CAGR of about 15%. The company intends to continue this momentum and expects to add a further $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in cash flow by the end of the decade. Exxon remains committed to its shareholders, having grown its annual dividend for 42 consecutive years. The company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.99 per share for Q1 of 2025 and also revealed plans to repurchase $20 billion in shares annually through 2026. Overall, XOMranks 1ston our list of the best oil stocks to invest in according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM to grow , our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Exxon Mobil CorporationXOM, the U.S. oil and gas giant, has failed to find commercially feasible natural gas reserves at an exploratory well, namely Elektra-1, which was drilled offshore Cyprus earlier this year. Earlier, XOM had mentioned that it collected extensive three-dimensional (3D) seismic data and discovered several large prospects offshore Cyprus, including the Electra prospect. Based on the evaluation of the seismic data, the company stated that the Electra prospect was promising. The U.S. energy major recently completed drilling activities at the Elektra-1 well. The Ministry of Energy, Commerce and Industry in Cyprus noted that preliminary assessments and the data collected from the exploratory well indicated that the gas reserves at the prospect were commercially infeasible for development. However, the ministry also noted that XOM’s initial assessments, following the drilling operations, have shown promising results. The initial results of the evaluation confirm the presence of a hydrocarbon system alongside high-quality reservoirs. The drilling operations at the Electra prospect were conducted by a consortium comprising ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Cyprus, and QatarEnergy International E&P LLC, with the former acting as the operator. The Elektra-1 well was drilled in Block 5 of the Exclusive Economic Zone (“EEZ”) in Cyprus. ExxonMobil holds exploration licenses in two offshore blocks in Cyprus, with QatarEnergy as its partner. The country's energy ministry has stated that the information collected while conducting drilling operations will be analyzed further and considered by the consortium before determining its future plans in Block 5. The consortium will now focus on drilling another exploratory well, Pegasus-1, located in a different offshore block in Cyrus’ EEZ. The results pose a major setback for Cyprus as the country is yet to produce natural gas from its offshore discoveries. Cyprus is trying to secure its position as an alternative natural gas supplier to the European Union (EU). After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, many European nations are trying to diversify their gas supply sources, and the Mediterranean region has attracted significant attention due to its offshore gas reserves. However, the initial assessment of the Elektra-1 well has dealt a blow to Cyprus’ ambitions to establish itself as an alternative supplier and contribute to the EU’s energy security.

Key Points Economic forecasters are raising the odds that we could experience a recession in the coming quarters.Goldman Sachshas hiked its recession probability a few times in recent weeks, bumping it from 20%all the wayto 45%. Meanwhile,JPMorganis even more bearish. Its recession model sees a nearly 80% chance the economy goes into a recession, up from 60% not long ago. Recessions tend to cause corporate profits to decline, which drives many companies to cut costs through layoffs and other initiatives. Some companies will even cut or suspend theirdividend paymentsto shareholders to conserve cash. However, other companies are more recession-resistant due to the durability of their cash flows and the strength of their balance sheets.ExxonMobil(XOM-0.34%)andCoca-Cola(KO-0.76%)have proven their ability to weather recessions over the decades. They've both increased their dividends throughout at least the past four recessions. There's a good chance they can withstand the next one with similar ease.  XOM Dividenddata byYCharts. Gray bars are recessions. ExxonMobil hiked its dividend payment by 4% earlier this year, extending its streak to 42 years of annual payment increases. \"We're proudof the factthat we've increased our annual dividend per share for 42 years in a row, something only 4% ofS&P 500companies can claim,\" stated CFO Kathy Mikells during the oil giant's fourth-quarter earnings conference call. She continued, \"And we plan for that track record to continue for decadesto come, which is only possible by investing in the high-quality growthopportunities that drive leading returns and higher cash flows.\" The energy company has been investing heavily in transforming its business to dramatically improve its underlying earnings power whilealsoexpanding into lower-carbon energy. This strategy has boosted its earnings capacity by nearly $14 billion over the past five years on a constant price and margin basis. Exxon plans to invest over $140 billion into major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program through 2030, which, along with structural cost savings, should add another $20 billion to its annual earnings capacity. That incremental income will give Exxon even more fuel to grow its dividend, which is already on an incredibly safe foundation. Last year,Exxon produced $34.4 billion in free cash flow, easily covering its $16.7 billion dividend outlay. Meanwhile, it has a fortress balance sheet with an ultra-low 6%leverage ratioand a massive $23.2 billion cash balance. These factors put the oil giant's 3.8%-yielding dividend on a rock-solid foundation that should continue withstanding recessions. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is800%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500. They just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now… *Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025 Coca-Cola boosted its dividend payment by 5.2% earlier this year. That extended its dividend growth streak to 63 straight years. That raise kept Coca-Cola in the ultra-elite group ofDividend Kings, companies with 50 or more years of annual dividend increases. The company has benefited from the durable and growing demand for its beverage brands. Its portfolio features multiple billion-dollar brands that generate lots of free cash flow for the company. Coca-Cola expects to produce $9.5 billion in free cash flow this year, more than enough to cover its dividend outlay ($8.4 billion last year). The company also has a strong cash-rich balance sheet ($12.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments) with leverage at the low end of its target range. Coca-Cola's long-term target is to organically grow its revenue by 4%-6% annually, which should drive mid-to-high single-digit earnings-per-share growth. Meanwhile, the company can enhance its growth rate by making accretive acquisitions. That puts it in a strong position to continue increasing its2.9%-yieldingdividend. Exxon and Coca-Cola have increased their dividendsevery yearfor several decades,which includesthe last four recessions.They're in excellent positions to continue raising their payout during the next downturn, whetherthat happenslater this year orfurtherin the future.Because of that, they're great dividend stocks to buy for a durable passive income stream.

Chicago, IL – April 14, 2025 – Zacks Value Trader is a podcast hosted weekly by Zacks Stock Strategist Tracey Ryniec. Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2445093/energy-stocks-take-a-dive-values-or-traps Welcome to Episode #401 of the Value Investor Podcast.  (0:15) - Can You Find Value In The Energy Industry or Are They Traps? (6:30) - Tracey Takes A Deep Dive Into 3 Stocks To Consider For Your Portfolio (32:20) - Episode Roundup: XOM, CVX, EOG Podcast@Zacks.com Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks. In April 2025, after the Liberation Day tariffs were put into place by the United States, crude oil plunged. WTI traded down to $56 a barrel and has been gyrating between $55 and $65 ever since. While lower oil prices can mean good news for consumers at the pump, it’s bad news for the energy producers who are unhedged and have certain breakeven levels. The oil and natural gas stocks have gotten hammered due to falling commodity prices and the uncertainty from the tariff turbulence of 2025. Although oil escaped direct American tariffs. Energy companies are lumped into different categories within the oil industry. In this podcast, Tracey talks about “Big Oil” which are the large, integrated oil companies and the American explorers and producers, or the “E & Ps.” The Integrated Oil stocks, as an industry, are down just 3.9% year-to-date. But the American E&Ps, as an industry, are now down 27.8% on the year. The E&Ps, which do not have refining, chemicals, or other divisions to offset their production, are much more volatile when oil sells off. Just because a stock sells-off and now has a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, doesn’t mean that it’s a true value in the classical sense of the word. Remember, a true value stock is cheap on a P/E basis, but also has rising earning estimates. Are the energy stocks cheap, or just traps? Exxon Mobil is a large American integrated oil company. Shares of Exxon are down 7.1% year-to-date but have finally started sinking in the last month, falling 10.6% in that time. Exxon appears cheap with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.1. The 2025 Zacks Consensus Estimate is looking for $7.13 but that’s 8.5% under the $7.79 Exxon made last year. One earnings estimate has been revised higher for 2025 and 2 lower in the last week. Exxon is a dividend all-star, with its dividend currently yielding 3.9%. Is Exxon Mobil a value or a trap in 2025? Chevron is also a large, American integrated oil company. Shares of Chevron are down 6.8% year-to-date but have been hit harder over the last month than Exxon. It’s down 14.3% during that time. But there have been dramatic one-day swings the last week. Chevron is cheap. It has a forward P/E of 13.3. The Zacks Consensus is looking for $10.30 in 2025, which is earnings growth of 2.5% as it made $10.05 in 2024. Chevron also pays an attractive dividend, yielding 4.8%. Is Chevron a value after the sell-off or a trap? EOG Resources is a large cap American exploration and production company. It produces in key basins including the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, and Dorado Play. EOG Resources has a strategy of returning at a minimum of 70% of annual free cash flow to shareholders. Shares of EOG Resources have fallen 14.7% year-to-date but have really taken it on the chin in the last month, declining 16.9%. It’s cheap, with a forward P/E of 9.5. A P/E under 10 is usually considered a dirt-cheap stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is looking for $11.09. EOG Resources made $11.62 last year so that is a decline of 4.6%. EOG Resources is currently paying a dividend yielding 3.5%. Is EOG Resources a value or a trap in 2025? Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.

A series of President Donald Trump’s ambiguous tariffs on several other countries, including China, wreaked havoc on Wall Street, and semiconductor stocks suffered the consequences. However, the latest tariff exemptions on chips and other high-tech goods boosted the equity market, leading to a recovery in many previously declining semiconductor stocks. Therefore, this is an ideal time to invest in strong semiconductor stocks, such asASML Holding N.V.ASML andNVIDIA CorporationNVDA, which are currently trading at a discount following a recent drop but are poised to benefit from the upcoming rebound. Of course, the tariff reliefs are temporary, and these semiconductor stocks may experience bouts of volatility if trade disputes remain unresolved within the specified time frame. However, these stocks have a wide moat, providing them a competitive advantage and immunity to market fluctuations. Let’s examine this in detail – Dutch company ASML is the global leader in producing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which are essential for manufacturing powerful artificial intelligence (AI) chips. The lithography equipment is pricey, so the company doesn’t need to sell many to make sufficient revenues. Although the company sold only 44 EUV systems last year, they accounted for 38% of its total net system sales of 21.8 billion euros. It sells to major chipmakers likeIntel CorporationINTC andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedTSM. Having a monopoly in EUV lithography systems could potentially lead to market share loss, with China developing similar systems. However, manufacturing these systems is time-consuming due to their complex nature. Thus, the current risk of losing the monopoly is minimal, allowing the company to sustain long-term growth for stakeholders. Similarly, Jensen Huang-led NVIDIA enjoys a more than 80% share in the growing discrete graphic processing units (GPUs) market, giving the company a competitive edge over its rivals and fueling long-term growth. The company’s CUDA software platform is gaining popularity globally among developers, while the demand for Blackwell chips has skyrocketed due to their better energy efficiency level and faster AI interface. For some time, the rapid growth of AI applications has spurred the demand for advanced memory chips that require ASML’s EUV equipment for their manufacture. ASML’s EUV lithography machines experienced an increase in new orders in the fourth quarter of 2024 and are anticipated to see a surge in first-quarter 2025 bookings as well. This is why, ASML is on track to post a strong first quarter and help the stock regain its mojo. For the first quarter, the company expects revenues of 7.5 billion euros to 8 billion euros, a substantial 46% increase year over year. The earnings are estimated to come in at 5.75 euros a share, a jump of 85% year over year. The continuous rise in AI data center spending will benefit NVIDIA in the long run. To meet the growing demand for AI workloads, major cloud computing companies are purchasing GPUs for their superior computing power. Three of the big cloud computing stocks are planning to spend $250 billion on AI data center infrastructure, while OpenAI, Softbank, and others are expected to spend $500 billion on data centers through the Stargate project.  For these reasons, NVIDIA predicts that AI data center expenditures will reach $1 trillion by 2028, providing room for stock growth. ASML’s global leadership in lithography and increasing product demand make its stock a compelling buy. Its shares have fallen 3% year to date but have gained 0.6% on Monday on Trump’s tariff reliefs. ASML’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 23.1%, and brokers have raised ASML’s average short-term price target by 42.3% to $953.61 from the previous $668.81. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Dominance in the GPU space and a rise in AI infrastructure spending should help NVIDIA stock climb upward, making it an enticing buy. Its shares have tanked 17.8% this year but the company anticipates a 47.5% growth in earnings for the current year. Brokers have raised NVDA’s average short-term price target by 56.8% to $173.95 from the previous $110.93 (read more: Which Mag-7 Stock, Apple or NVIDIA, Should You Buy for Tariff Relief?)

Nvidia said it would record a $5.5 billion charge on its quarterly earnings and disclosed that the U.S. will now require a license for exporting the company's H20 processors to China and other countries. Nvidia shares fell more than 6% in after-hours trading. The H20 chips have far less processing power than the latest top-of-the-line Nvidia processors. Nvidia says new US restrictions on exports of its H2O chip to China will cost the company billions of dollars. Bloomberg's Michael Shepard reports. The chip maker will take a $5.5 billion charge in the current quarter for H20 inventory and canceled sales. The U.S. government ”indicated that the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China,” Nvidia said. The airline issued dual-guidance benchmarks in the face of extreme market uncertainty. The Dow Jones rose on the stock market today and auto stocks popped after President Donald Trump spoke out. Palantir stock was higher while Nvidia fell. Want to be a better investor?

(Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Tuesday it was issuing new export licensing requirements for Nvidia's H20, AMD's MI308 artificial intelligence chips, as well as their equivalents, to China. \"The Commerce Department is committed to acting on the President's directive to safeguard our national and economic security,\" a Commerce spokesperson said. Nvidia said earlier on Tuesday that it would take $5.5 billion in charges after the U.S. government limited exports of its H20 artificial intelligence chip to China, a key market for one of its most popular chips. (Reporting by Karen Freifeld; Editing by Himani Sarkar) Chinese sellers of items from lunch boxes to appliances have taken to social media platform Rednote to generate sympathy purchases, telling domestic consumers they are offloading stock at bargain prices amid U.S. tariffs.  Over the past week, dozens of sellers have broadcast livestreams showing goods produced for U.S. customers, which they said they could no longer sell because of tariff rates of 145% for made-in-China goods imposed by President Donald Trump's administration.  Some of the sellers sold items such as Costa Coffee mugs, but most were brands not widely known abroad, such as OSTMARS and APLX, which are sold on Amazon.

      "content": "Consensus 2025 Prices Increase This Friday 02 DAY 11 HOUR 51 MIN 29 SEC The mood in the equity and crypto market turned sour late Tuesday as Nvidia shares crashed in after-hours trading following a$5.5 billion chargetied to the Trump administration's decisionto banthe company's H20 chip sales to China. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell to $83,600, extending the retreat from the two-week high of $86,440 reached earlier in the day, CoinDesk data showed. Payments-focused XRP followed a similar trajectory, falling over 2% to $2.08, while Cardano's ADA token slipped 4% to $0.61. TheCoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, weakened over 2%. Meanwhile, coins supposedly associated with artificial intelligence (AI) continued to fare worse as shares in NVDA tanked 8% to $89.10 after thecompany disclosedin a regulatory filing that it expects to write down $5.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter due to the new restrictions on exports of its H20 chip to China. The news came a day afterunusual activity in NVDA put optionspointing to an impending market swoon. The futures tied to the Nasdaq index fell over 1% as well, offering negative cues to risk assets in general. The next catalyst awaiting release Wednesday morning Eastern time is the U.S. retail sales report for March. Per economists polled by Dow Jones, the data is expected to show a 1.2% increase in consumer spending on the month, up from a 0.2% climb in February. A better-than-expected report will likely help assuage recession fears triggered by President Donald Trump's trade war with China and other trading partners. However, there is a risk that markets will dismiss it as backward-looking, failing to account for the major escalation in trade tensions seen this month. Federal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell is alsoscheduled to speakon Wednesday at the Economic Club of Chicago on his outlook for the U.S. economy. \"All eyes are on Powell. Markets are holding their breath for Powell on Wednesday. Between the trade war and rising recession chatter, traders are watching for any hint the Fed might be forced to cut sooner than expected,\" Secure Digital Markets said in Tuesday's research note. The forward-looking market-based measures like the inflation breakevens have dropped amid trade tensions, pointing to the disinflationary impact of Trump's tariffs. That could provide the Fed with a leeway to cut rates. Early this week, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Wallersaidthe bank would be forced to quickly make a series of \"bad news\" rate cuts if the U.S. president reimposes the levies unveiled on April 2. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on 180 nations on April 2 but quickly suspended the same for most nations, excluding China, for 90 days.

(Bloomberg) — Oil fell for a second day as wider markets turned lower and expectations increased for a glut because of the escalating trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. Most Read from Bloomberg How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? Trump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space LA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs $15 Million Fund Bets Leadership Training Can Improve Chicago Policing Brent crude (BZ=F) traded near $64 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) dropping below $61. Concerns over global oil demand worsened after Beijing swapped its chief trade envoy and said that relying on domestic consumption was insufficient to spur growth. In wider markets, warnings by ASML Holdings NV and Nvidia Corp. on the effects of tariffs weighed on US equity futures. China’s downbeat outlook came as Beijing replaced its chief international trade negotiator in a closely watched appointment as traders try to anticipate any possible shifts in China’s stance toward Washington. The shuffle came after President Donald Trump insisted on Tuesday that the ball was in Beijing’s court to start negotiations with Washington. “While we may have seen a peak in headline tariff rates, the intensifying standoff between the US and China is casting a long shadow over global demand expectations,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist for Saxo Markets Pte. “The uncertainty around retaliatory measures and supply chain disruptions is weighing on risk appetite and, in turn, on the oil market.” Crude remains near the lowest in four years, after a sharp drop earlier this month brought about by an onslaught of tariffs and counter-levies between the US and its biggest trading partners. Washington on Tuesday launched a probe into the need for import taxes on critical minerals, while struggling to bridge trade differences this week with the European Union as White House officials said the bulk of the US tariffs imposed on the bloc won’t be removed. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency on Tuesday slashed its forecasts for global oil consumption this year, and said that supply additions are likely to be more than enough to satisfy demand. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reported US nationwide crude inventories rose by 2.4 million barrels last week, which would be the third consecutive advance if confirmed by official data later Wednesday. However, the report indicated declines at the oil storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, and in fuel inventories. To get Bloomberg’s Energy Daily newsletter in your inbox, click here.

SINGAPORE—-China’s economy got a boost in the first quarter from a rush of exports to the U.S. ahead of stiff new tariffs, but growth is set to slow as the trade war between Washington and Beijing heats up.  How serious that slowdown will get depends on how successful Chinese exporters are at finding new markets for goods shut out of the U.S. by sky-high new tariffs.  It also depends on how big a boost to spending Beijing can generate at home to offset weakness overseas.

CEO Christophe Fouquet said his conversations with customers supported ASML's expectations that 2025 and 2026 would be growth years.  \"However, the recent tariff announcements have increased uncertainty in the macro environment,\" Fouquet said in a statement. China's first-quarter economic growth outstripped expectations, underpinned by solid consumption and industrial output, but analysts fear momentum could shift sharply lower as U.S. tariffs pose the biggest risk to the Asian powerhouse in decades.  President Donald Trump has ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese goods to eye-watering levels, prompting Beijing to slap retaliatory duties on U.S. imports that have raised the stakes for the world's two biggest economies and rattled financial markets.  Data on Wednesday showed China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.4% in the January-March quarter from a year earlier, unchanged from the fourth quarter, but beat analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a rise of 5.1%. Nvidia did not warn at least some major customers in advance about new U.S. export rules it was told about a week ago requiring it to obtain licenses to sell its China-focused artificial intelligence chip, according to two sources familiar with the matter.  The U.S. chipmaker disclosed on Tuesday that American officials had informed the company on April 9 that its H20 chip would require an export license for sales to China.  The move to restrict H20 shipments marks Washington's latest effort to limit China's access to advanced semiconductors, as the United States seeks to maintain its edge in AI technology.

In a filing Tuesday, Nvidia said it was informed by the U.S. government that it will need a license to export its H20 AI chips to China. This license will be required indefinitely, according to the filing — the U.S. government cited “risk that the [H20] may be used in […] a supercomputer in China.” Nvidia anticipates $5.5 billion in related charges in its Q1 2026 fiscal year, which ends April 27. The company’s stock was down around 6% in extended trading. The H20 is the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can export to China under the U.S.’ current and previous export rules. Last week,NPRreported that CEO Jensen Huang might havetalked his way outof new H20 restrictions during a dinner at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, in part by committing that Nvidia would invest in AI data centers in the U.S. Perhaps not-so-coincidentally, Nvidiaannounced on Mondaythat it would spend hundreds of millions of dollars over the next four years manufacturing some AI chips in the U.S.Punditswere quick to point out that the company’s commitment was light on the details. Multiple government officials had been calling for stronger export controls on the H20 because the chip was allegedly used to train models from China-based AI startup DeepSeek, including the R1 “reasoning” model that threw the U.S. AI market for a loop in January.

(Bloomberg) — Technology stocks fell as new US government restrictions on the export of Nvidia Corp. chips to China and a disappointing report from Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML Holding NV (ASML) fanned trade war concerns. Most Read from Bloomberg How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? Trump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space LA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs $15 Million Fund Bets Leadership Training Can Improve Chicago Policing President Donald Trump’s administration has barred Nvidia from selling its H20 chip in China, an escalation of Washington’s tech battle with Beijing. ASML later added to investor anxiety by posting orders that missed expectations and saying that it doesn’t know how to quantify the impact of recent tariff announcements. The latest developments show how tariffs are already wreaking havoc on global companies, while the trade war is extending beyond mere import taxes as well. The fallout could weigh on chip-sector earnings and also set back China’s ambitions to compete on the global tech stage. The H20 restrictions are “driven by concerns over China’s rise in the electronics sector, and in that sense, it is likely to become a permanent policy,” said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management. “It is expected to have a significant negative impact on semiconductor supply chain.” Nvidia warned that it will report around $5.5 billion in related charges during the fiscal first quarter. Its shares slid about 5% in late US trading Tuesday. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) later extended losses to more than 2% after ASML’s report. Among key suppliers, Korean memory maker SK Hynix Inc. slumped as much as 3.9% Wednesday. Top foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM,2330.TW) fell 2.9%. Japanese chip-equipment maker Advantest Corp. dropped as much as 7.8%, extending its fall after ASML’s statement. TSMC was already likely to slow some production expansion on a weaker economic outlook, and “the tighter rules on Nvidia’s China sales might amplify the deceleration,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Ken Hui wrote in a note. For China, the broader restrictions raise concerns that access to global tech hardware will be further choked off. Exports of the most-advanced chips and equipment to the Asian nation are already banned, and the H20 is a scaled-down product specifically designed not to be too powerful. Even after DeepSeek raised hopes that advances can be made in artificial intelligence and other fields without the most cutting-edge chips, China’s tech giants may suffer if curbs keep getting extended. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA,9988.HK) sank as much as 5.4% in Hong Kong trading Wednesday, while Baidu Inc. (BIDU,9888.HK) fell 3.3%. “It is a reminder of the potential susceptibility of tech stocks to the ongoing prickly relationship between the US and China regarding semiconductors,” said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade in Sydney. “There is a reliance on the H20 chip from big name players in the Asian tech space, so any moves which could impact supply will be a drag on the broader sector.” On the other side of the equation, China continues to work toward self-reliance in technology, though its companies are still seen lagging far behind advanced global leaders like Nvidia. Among Chinese hardware stocks bucking the regional sector declines Wednesday, Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd. (HK0000218211.SG) jumped as much as 6.6% in Hong Kong while Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc. rose 2.1% in Shanghai. “AI innovation in China is booming and the H20 ban would not dampen it — it may accelerate the use of China domestic chips,” said Vey-Sern Ling, a managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. “Domestic AI chips may not perform as well as Nvidia’s H20, but that is missing the point. China has been able to develop innovative AI models despite US restrictions.” —With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi.

Inflation eased back last month, paving the way for interest rate cuts as economists said “Storm Donald” would limit price rises but hurt growth. It's been a sea of red in Asia so far on Wednesday, with new U.S. moves turning up the heat in the trade war with China, but at least the losses have been relatively shallow compared with other down days of the past few weeks.  Washington issued new export licensing requirements for Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 artificial intelligence chips to China.  Nvidia's shares slumped 6% in after-hours trading, after it said the move would cost $5.5 billion. Nvidia on Tuesday said it would take $5.5 billion in charges after the U.S. government limited exports of its H20 artificial intelligence chip to China, a key market for one of its most popular chips.  Nvidia's AI chips have been a key focus of U.S. export controls as U.S. officials have moved to keep the most advanced chips from being sold to China as the U.S. tries to keep ahead in the AI race.  After those controls were implemented, Nvidia began designing chips that would come as close as possible to U.S. limits.

Key Points Some of Wall Street's most-popular stocks were sent to the chopping block by prominent asset managers prior to the market's wild gyrations. Every so often, Wall Street reminds investors that stocks don't move higher in a straight line. Sometimes,these reminders are anything but subtle. Over the last two weeks, investors have witnessed volatility akin to the COVID-19 crash of February-March 2020, as well as during the height of the financial crisis in 2008. On one end of the spectrum, theDow Jones Industrial Average,S&P 500, andNasdaq Compositeall logged their largest individual point gains on April 9 since their respective inceptions. Conversely, these indexes have endured some of their largest nominal point declines on record followingPresident Donald Trump's April 2nd Liberation Day tariff announcement. Image source: Getty Images. Although history has shown that outsized volatility tends to create phenomenal buying opportunities for patient investors, some of Wall Street's brightest money managers appear to have seen these warning signs for the stock market well in advance. In particular, select billionaire investors sold shares of three incredibly popular but pricey stocks ahead of Wall Street's record-setting bout of volatility. The first pricey but cutting-edge stock that billionaires were jettisoning prior to Wall Street's wild vacillations isartificial intelligence (AI)-driven data-mining specialistPalantir Technologies(PLTR6.27%). Billionaire Philippe Laffont, who oversees close to $29.7 billion in assets at Coatue Management, dumped more than 4.81 million shares of Palantir during the second quarter of 2024. It's a similar story for Duquesne Family Office's billionaire chief Stanley Druckenmiller, who sold more than 728,000 shares of Palantir after March 31, 2024. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is800%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500. They just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now… *Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025 On the surface, Palantir has a lot to offer. Both of its AI-powered software-as-a-service platforms, Gotham and Foundry, are irreplaceable at scale. Additionally, Gotham tends to lock in contracts with federal governments spanning four or five years, while Foundry is a subscription-based model that incents business loyalty. This is to say that on top of Palantir having a sustainable moat, its cash flow tends to be highly predictable. However, there's a degree of near-term growth uncertainty hovering around Palantir at present. President Trump's efforts to rein in federal spending are casting doubt on what the defense budget might look like over the coming four years. Gotham relies heavily on contracts from the U.S. government. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow forecast is alsocalling for the steepest contraction in organic gross domestic product (GDP)for the U.S. economy (excluding the COVID-19 quarters) since the tail-end of the Great Recession -- a 2.4% decline, based on an April 9 update. This suggests the commercially focused Foundry segment might endure subpar subscription growth in the coming quarters. But what's really been a hard pill to swallow is Palantir's valuation. During previous technology and next-big-thing innovation bubbles, leading-edge businesses peaked atprice-to-sales (P/S) ratiosin the neighborhood of 30 to 40. Palantir stock traded at roughly 100 times sales when it hit its all-time closing high less than two months ago. Even after a modest pullback, Palantir is still commanding a P/S ratio of 75, whichis a level that's never been sustainable throughout history. Image source: Getty Images. Palantir wasn't the only ultra-popular AI stock that was largely shown the door ahead of Wall Street's historic volatility. Semiconductor kingpinNvidia(NVDA1.30%)is a juggernaut thatfour billionaire money managers sent to the chopping block: What made Nvidia such a popular stock to ownis its near-monopoly share of the graphics processing units (GPUs) that act as the brains in AI-accelerated data centers. Nvidia's Hopper (H100) and next-generation Blackwell GPUs are what power AI solutions, as well as the training of most large language models. But the dicey thing about next-big-thing trends is they've allworked their way through an early stage bubble-bursting eventover the last 30-plus years. Dating back to the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, every game-changing innovation has eventually failed to meet investors' lofty expectations. All technologies need time to mature, but investors consistently overestimate early adoption rates and/or utility. If the AI bubble bursts, Nvidia stock would almost certainly be hit hard. Nvidia also faces the threat of growing internal competition. Many of its top customers by net sales are developing AI-GPUs and solutions of their own to use in their data centers. While this hardware isn't a threat to the superior computing speed of Nvidia's AI-GPUs, it is notably cheaper and more accessible. This is a recipe for Nvidia to lose out on valuable data center real estate, and for its gross margin to decline. Though Nvidia isn't pricey relative to its forward-year earnings, it is still valued at a P/S ratio of 21. While this is down 50% from its P/S ratio of 42 last summer, it's still more than double the P/S ratios of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers. The third pricey stock billionaire money managers were sellers of prior to Wall Street's wild volatility isfast-casual restaurant chainChipotle Mexican Grill(CMG-1.42%). During the December-ended quarter, Coatue's Philippe Laffont completely exited his fund's stake in Chipotle by selling nearly 4.6 million shares. Additionally, billionaire Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Managementaxed close to 16.6 million split-adjusted shares throughout 2024. The \"split-adjusted\" aspect takes into account thatChipotle Mexican Grill effected a 50-for-1 forward split in June. Like the other companies listed here, Chipotle presents with competitive advantages that have made it a popular stock to own. Its use of responsibly raised meats and locally sourced vegetables (when possible) speaks to consumers who prefer organic and natural foods. Plus, using only fresh ingredients and keeping its menu relatively small allows staff to quickly prepare meals and keep the queue moving. Furthermore, Chipotle's introduction of mobile-dedicated drive-thru lanes (known as \"Chipotlanes\") prior to the pandemic led to an entirely new source of revenue for the company. But it's not all peaches and cream, or should I say avocados and beans, for Chipotle. While it's benefited from the willingness of consumers to pay a higher price for organic and natural foods, there comes a point where inflationary pressures begin to weigh on the company's margins and/or its customer base. During the December-ended quarter, the company's comparable restaurant sales growth clocked in at only 5.4%. This is well below its historic average, which potentially signals that inflationary pressures are hitting home. To stay consistent with this list,the other prime concern for Chipotle Mexican Grill is its valuation. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33 is aggressive considering half of its sales growth is coming from the opening of new stores. With organic growth from existing stores hovering in the 5% to 7% range, and the scope of innovation somewhat limited for restaurants, a forward P/E of 33 arguably prices Chipotle stock for perfection.

      "title": "Nvidia faces $5.5 billion charge as US restricts chip sales to China",
      "date": "2025-04-15 21:33:21",
      "url": "https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-expects-5-5-billion-213321749.html?.tsrc=rss",
      "content": "Oops, something went wrong Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results By Stephen Nellis and Karen Freifeld (Reuters) - Nvidia on Tuesday said it would take $5.5 billion in charges after the U.S. government limited exports of its H20 artificial intelligence chip to China, a key market for one of its most popular chips. Nvidia's AI chips have been a key focus of U.S. export controls as U.S. officials have moved to keep the most advanced chips from being sold to China as the U.S. tries to keep ahead in the AI race. After those controls were implemented, Nvidia began designing chips that would come as close as possible to U.S. limits. Nvidia shares were down about 6% in after-hours trading. A U.S. Commerce Department spokesperson said late on Tuesday that it was issuing new licensing requirements for exports of chips including Nvidia's H20, AMD's MI308 and their equivalents. \"The Commerce Department is committed to acting on the President's directive to safeguard our national and economic security,\" said the spokesperson of the department that oversees U.S. export controls. AMD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its shares were down 7% in after-hours trading. For Nvidia, the H20 is its most advanced chip available for sale in China and is central to its efforts to stay engaged with China's booming AI industry. Chinese companies including Tencent, Alibaba and TikTok parent ByteDance had been ramping up orders for H20 chips due to booming demand for low-cost AI models from startup DeepSeek, Reuters reported in February. While the H20 chip is not as fast at training AI models as Nvidia's chips for sale outside China, it is competitive with some of those chips at a step known as inference, where AI models serve up answers to users. Inference is fast becoming the biggest part of the AI chip market. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month argued that Nvidia is well positioned to dominate that shift. But Nvidia said on Tuesday that the U.S. government was restricting H20 sales to China because of the risk the chips could be used in a supercomputer. While the H20 has lower computing capabilities than other Nvidia chips, its ability to connect to memory chips and other computing chips at high speeds is still high. Those memory and connectivity aspects could make the H20 useful in building supercomputers in China, and the U.S. has placed restrictions on selling chips for use in supercomputers in China since 2022. The Institute for Progress, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday argued for restricting H20 chips, writing that Chinese firms were likely already building such systems. \"At least one of the buyers, Tencent, has already installed H20s in a facility used to train a large model, very likely in breach of existing controls restricting the usage of chips in supercomputers exceeding certain thresholds. DeepSeek’s supercomputer used to train their V3 model is also likely in breach of the same restrictions,\" the group wrote. Nvidia said on Tuesday that the U.S. government informed it on April 9 that the H20 chip would require a license to be exported to China and on April 14 it told Nvidia those rules would be in place indefinitely. It is unclear how many, if any, of those licenses the U.S. government might grant. Nvidia declined to comment beyond its filing. The $5.5 billion in charges are associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments and related reserves, Nvidia said. The news comes after Nvidia said on Monday it was planning to build AI servers worth as much as $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years with help from partners such as TSMC, in step with the Trump administration's push for local manufacturing. (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, Karen Freifeld in New York, and Utkarsh Shetti in Bengaluru; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Jamie Freed) BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — The White House is urging Colombia to halt the implementation of new auto safety regulations that could jeopardize American car exports to Colombia, as both nations prepare to discuss tariffs recently imposed on Colombian products including coffee, avocados, flowers and oil. ZURICH (Reuters) -Optimism in parts of the U.S. construction industry has fallen in the wake of President Donald Trump's unpredictable trade policies, construction chemicals maker Sika's Chief Executive Thomas Hasler said on Tuesday.  \"We had a very strong start to the year and people were very optimistic about infrastructure investments and reshoring,\" Hasler told Reuters after the Swiss company reported first-quarter sales on Tuesday.  But the mood changed following Trump's announcement of tariffs on Mexico and Canada, which created uncertainty among U.S. companies, he said. SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A consumer advocacy group filed a lawsuit this week to block insurers from charging California customers for $500 million in costs associated with the deadly Los Angeles fires. As Canada faces a labour shortage in the trades, how will so many promised projects get off the ground? SANTIAGO (Reuters) -Chile, Canada and Peru - three of the largest copper suppliers to the United States - have told President Donald Trump's administration that imports of the metal from their countries do not threaten U.S. security interests and should not face potential tariffs.  The comments by the three countries come during an escalating tariff war between the United States and nearly every trading partner on which it relies.  Copper is used in construction, transportation, electronics and many other industries. BEIJING/CHICAGO (Reuters) -Global grain merchant Archer-Daniels-Midland has begun shutting down domestic trading operations in China and laying off staff within its largest business segment as part of a global cost-cutting push, the company said on Monday.  The company did not disclose the number of layoffs, but a source familiar with the matter said job cuts would impact 40 to 50 employees, leaving only around 10 staff in the financial hub of Shanghai.  \"The entire Ag Services and Oilseeds team in China has essentially been let go,\" the source said, referring to ADM's largest business segment. U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China comes at a bad time for sorghum growers like Dan Atkisson in Kansas, who is nevertheless preparing to increase plantings by 25% this spring.  China accounted for nearly 90% of U.S. sorghum exports last year, ramping up purchases of the crop it uses to feed livestock and make fiery baijiu liquor.  U.S. sorghum exports to China dropped to 78,316 metric tons in January and February from more than 1.4 million metric tons over the same period a year earlier, down 95%, according to U.S. government data. When Brazil hiked trade barriers in its auto market over a decade ago, the government promised more local manufacturing, reliable jobs and better cars.  As the U.S. auto industry confronts major tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, executives and analysts are drawing parallels with Brazil, once the world's fourth-largest auto market and now a case study in the dangers of protectionism.  Philipp Schiemer, former head of Mercedes-Benz in Brazil and Latin America, learned some of those lessons the hard way as he opened a plant in Sao Paulo making luxury cars, which was shut down in 2020. Global sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles rose 29% year-on-year in March, helped by growth in China and Europe, while EV growth in North America was hampered by U.S. President Donald Trump's stance towards emissions standards and uncertainties around tariffs, data showed on Tuesday.  U.S. tariffs on car imports may force some of the country's automakers which produce in neighbouring Mexico to readjust prices, or move their production, Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester said.  Chinese counter-tariffs, meanwhile, could affect Tesla's U.S.-made models, leading to an almost doubling in prices of its Model S and Model X cars sold in China, Lester said. PARIS (Reuters) -Nearly three dozen global pharmaceutical companies, in a letter to the head of the European Commission, demanded help to maintain operations in the EU despite threatened U.S. tariffs on imports, including measures to compensate them for the cost of pharmaceutical innovations, French business newspaper Les Echos reported on Tuesday.  In the letter sent to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the companies -- including Pfizer, Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca -- said they face cost disadvantages in Europe versus the United States, where drugs are sold at prices that on average are twice that of some European countries, such as France, Les Echos reported.

By Stella Qiu SYDNEY (Reuters) -Shares fell in Asia on Wednesday as AI darling Nvidia took a hit from U.S. curbs on chip sales to China, highlighting the damage to come in a tit-for-tat global trade war, while gold hit a record and the safe-haven currencies jumped. Treasury yields were steady ahead of a key speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell later in the day. Traders are wondering if he will echo the surprisingly dovish tone set by his colleague Fed Governor Christopher Waller, or stay more balanced. Overnight, Washington issued new export licensing requirements for Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 artificial intelligence chips to China. Nvidia's shares slumped 6% in after-hours trading, after it said the move would cost $5.5 billion. \"This disclosure is a clear sign that Nvidia now has massive restrictions and hurdles in selling to China,\" said Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities. \"The Street will take this news with clear nervousness worried these are the first shots fired in the tech battle between the US and China and Beijing/Xi are not just going to take this news and walk away.\" Separately, President Donald Trump ordered a probe into potential new tariffs on all U.S. critical minerals imports, on top of reviews into pharmaceutical and chip imports. Beijing is continuing to play hardball, having reportedly ordered airlines to suspend deliveries of Boeing aircraft. The sell-off in Asian stocks gathered pace in the afternoon. S&P 500 futures fell 1.5% while Nasdaq futures slumped 2.3%. The gloom is set to spread to Europe, with EURO STOXX 50 futures pointing to a 1.5% drop at the open. On Wednesday, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.4%, snapping a four-day winning streak. Japan's Nikkei dropped 1.6%. Chinese blue chips fell 0.7% as investors failed to find much solace in some solid GDP data that predated the tariff increases in April. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slumped 2.7%. \"Both countries seem to believe they have the upper hand, potentially prolonging the current stalemate for months to come,\" said analysts at PGIM Fixed Income in a note to clients. \"China appears to have no intention of climbing down from its current stance on tariffs and instead views the current trade dynamics as an opportunity to make inroads with countries that export to the U.S.\" The White House said Trump is open to making a trade deal with China but Beijing should make the first move. GOLD SHINES All of the uncertainties left gold in an unstoppable position, with the bullion up 2% to hit another record high of $3,290 per ounce. ANZ on Wednesday updated their forecast for gold to hit $3,600 an ounce by the year-end, arguing that the risk-off purchases for the asset are yet to pick up. The step down in risk appetite is evident via rises in the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. The dollar lost 1.1% to 0.8145 Swiss franc and fell 0.7% to 142.32 yen. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda told the Sankei newspaper that the central bank may need to take policy action if U.S. tariffs hurt the Japanese economy, signalling the potential to pause the bank's rate-hike cycle. U.S. Treasuries, however, failed to draw support from the risk aversion and were steady on Wednesday. The benchmark 10-year yield was steady at 4.325%, well off the recent high of 4.592%. The 30-year yield was little changed at 4.777%, also some 25 basis points lower from the high seen last week. Oil prices were lower. Brent fell 1.1% at $63.99 a barrel, while U.S. crude also dropped 1.1% to $60.65 per barrel.

Nvidia (NVDA,Financials)is set to launchthe GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, expanding its RTX 50 Series with new desktop and laptop graphics cards that feature DLSS 4 and the company's latest Blackwell RTX architecture. A second card, the GeForce RTX 5060, will follow in May, along with corresponding laptops. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. According to the company's announcement, the RTX 5060 family introduces DLSS 4's Multi Frame Generation, which uses artificial intelligence to generate up to three extra frames for every traditionally rendered frame. The result, Nvidia said, is up to an eightfold increase in frame rates compared to traditional rendering. Nvidia said the transformer AI model powering DLSS 4 is trained on high-resolution gameplay, improving both image clarity and performance. It also supports features like DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Ray Reconstruction. These technologies are already integrated into more than 100 games and applications. The new cards are aimed at users upgrading from older 60 and 50 class models. Nvidia said there are over 50 million users of these previous-generation cards, and the RTX 5060 family offers a significant performance leap. In titles such asHogwarts Legacy, the company said the RTX 5060 Ti achieves twice the frame rate of the RTX 4060 Ti at 1440p settings, with reduced latency and smoother gameplay. The RTX 5060 desktop cards come in 8GB and 16GB variants and will be available through partners including ASUS, GIGABYTE, MSI, and ZOTAC. Laptops equipped with the RTX 5060 will launch in May from major manufacturers and offer similar improvements in performance and power efficiency, according to Nvidia. The cards feature new Tensor Cores, Shader Cores, Ray Tracing Cores, and GDDR7 VRAM. Nvidia also said users can expect faster video encoding and support for DisplayPort 2.1. The rollout marks Nvidia's continued effort to integrate neural rendering and real-time AI-powered graphics into mainstream gaming hardware. The company said its Reflex latency-reduction technology is now supported in more than 130 titles, including popular esports games likeValorant. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.

BANGKOK (AP) — Shares in computer chip makers slumped in after-hours trading and in Asia after Nvidia said tighter U.S. government controls on exports of computer chips used forartificial intelligencewill cost it an extra $5.5 billion. The company, which announced Monday that it will produce its artificial intelligence super computers in the United States for the first time, said the government told it that its H20 integrated circuits and others of the same bandwidth would be subject to the controls for the “indefinite future.” In a regulatory filing,it saidthe government said the controls addressed risks that the products “may be used in or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.” Nvidia's shares fell 6.3% in after-hours trading. Shares in rival chip maker AMD dropped 7.1% after markets closed. Asian technology giants also saw big declines. Testing equipment maker Advantest's shares fell 6.7% in Tokyo, Disco Corp. lost 7.6% and Taiwan's TSMC dropped 2.4%. Earlier, reports had said the Trump administration had backed away from imposing stricter licensing requirements on the H20 chip. Commerce Department officials were not immediately available for comment early Wednesday. Nvidia said Mondayit has commissioned more than one million square feet of manufacturing space to build and test its specialized Blackwell chips in Arizona and AI supercomputers in Texas — part of an investment the company said will produce up to half a trillion dollars of AI infrastructure in the next four years. The announcement comes after President Donald Trump and other officials saidtariff exemptionson electronics like smartphones and laptops were only a temporary reprieve until officials develop a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry. Trump claimed that decision as a victory for his effort to expand manufacturing in the U.S. The Dow Jones rose on the stock market today and auto stocks popped after President Donald Trump spoke out.

Investing.com -- AI powerhouse NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) disclosed on Tuesday that it anticipates up to $5.5 billion in charges in its upcoming first-quarter financial results related to U.S. chip export controls on China, sending its shares down sharply in aftermarket trade. The announcement follows the U.S. government’s decision to mandate licenses for exports of the H20 chip to China, including Hong Kong and Macau, as well as to D:5 countries or companies with ultimate parent companies in those regions. Shares of NVIDIA fell 6% to $105.42 in after-hours trading following the news. Those of peers such as AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) sank between 2% and 7%, while major Nvidia supplier TSMC (NYSE:TSM) shed 2.4%. The disclosure from NVIDIA comes just one day after the company made headlines after announcing a $500 billion investment to produce AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S. The U.S. government communicated to NVIDIA on April 9, 2025, that a license would be required for exporting the H20 integrated circuits, as well as any other circuits with similar memory and interconnect bandwidth capabilities. On April 14, 2025, it was further clarified that this licensing requirement would remain in place indefinitely. The measure is intended to prevent the potential use of Nvidia’s products in Chinese supercomputers or military applications. Nvidia said the $5.5 billion charge is related to inventory, purchase commitments, and associated reserves for its H20 microchip products. \"The financial impact is small relatively, but the strategic blow is the focus of the market as Nvidia now has massive blockades going after the China market in the middle of this raging US/China tariff battle,\" Wedbush analysts wrote in a note. \"Nvidia is a key strategic asset for the US and the Trump Administration during this very tense period with China...and the White House is going to make sure Jensen and Nvidia’s chips do not land in China for now and help Beijing in the AI Revolution.\" The H20 chip is the main AI chip Nvidia is permitted to sell in China under export restrictions imposed by the Biden administration, as it sought to close off Beijing’s access to cutting-edge advancements in AI tech. Still, earlier media reports showed Nvidia clocked strong demand for its H20 chips in China, as Chinese AI development and investment ramped up following the release of DeepSeek earlier this year. The Information reported earlier in April that Chinese firms including ByteDance,AlibabaGroup (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) had ordered at least $16 billion worth of H20 chips in the first three months of 2025.

Nvidia said it would record a $5.5 billion charge on its quarterly earnings and disclosed that the U.S. will now require a license for exporting the company's H20 processors to China and other countries.  Nvidia shares fell more than 6% in after-hours trading.  The H20 chips have far less processing power than the latest top-of-the-line Nvidia processors. Want to be a better investor?

By Fanny Potkin and Liam Mo SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA) did not warn at least some major customers in advance about new U.S. export rules it was told about a week ago requiring it to obtain licenses to sell its China-focused artificial intelligence chip, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The U.S. chipmaker disclosed on Tuesday that American officials had informed the company on April 9 that its H20 chip would require an export license for sales to China. The move to restrict H20 shipments marks Washington's latest effort to limit China's access to advanced semiconductors, as the United States seeks to maintain its edge in AI technology. Major Chinese cloud companies were still anticipating H20 deliveries by year-end, unaware of the impending restrictions, according to the two sources, who said Nvidia's China sales team also did not appear to be informed ahead of the public announcement. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. Nvidia declined to comment. The export controls threaten Nvidia's business in China, one of its largest markets. Nvidia had secured $18 billion of H20 orders since the start of the year, according to one of the two sources and a third source. China generated $17 billion in revenue, or 13% of Nvidia's total sales, in its last fiscal year that ended on January 26. Nvidia shares fell 6% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after it said it would take up to $5.5 billion of charges in the first quarter ending April 27 due to the licensing requirement, which the U.S. government told it on Monday would be indefinite. The charges are associated with inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves for H20 products, the company said. Chinese tech giants including Tencent, Alibaba and ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, had increased orders for H20 chips amid surging demand for affordable AI models from companies like startup DeepSeek, Reuters reported in February. Alibaba (BABA), ByteDance and Tencent (TCEHY,0700.HK) did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The H20 is the primary chip Nvidia is legally permitted to sell in China and was launched after the latest round of U.S. export restrictions took effect in October 2023. Washington has banned exports of Nvidia's most advanced chips to China since 2022, concerned that advanced technologies could be used by China to build up its military capabilities. The restrictions on H20 could benefit Chinese AI chipmakers, particularly Huawei, which offers competing products to Nvidia's lineup, analysts said. \"By restricting the H20 system, U.S. regulators are effectively pushing Nvidia's Chinese customers toward Huawei's AI chips,\" said Nori Chiou, investment director at Singapore-based White Oak Capital Partners. \"Huawei's chip design and software capabilities are likely to advance quickly as it gains more customers and development experience,\" Chiou added.

We recently published a list ofJim Cramer’s Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. On Friday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer outlined what investors should focus on in the week, especially pointing to earnings reports from major banks. “Rumor, innuendo, intrigue these are the stuff of great novels, of fabulous miniseries, riveting plays, and now they’re the stuff of the stock market.” READ ALSO:Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocksand10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently. He noted the chaotic nature of the current environment and remarked that “this tape has it all,” and emphasized how unpredictable developments from the White House have added to the turbulence. Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes. “Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,” he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, “Except this isn’t an eight-part blockbuster, it’s our money.” Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday’s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic. Cramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a “liberation day bottom,” a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, “Not sure, I’m just not sure.” He added: “Have you ever noticed the weekends don’t provide relaxation anymore because the president’s got advisors? He’s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He’s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime…. Monday’s trading, well, let’s just say that it looks like that it’s earning season so it’s gonna be even harder than usual.” For this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 186 Coming to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Cramer noted: “A few minutes after 2:00 AM on Thursday, we get to listen to Taiwan Semiconductor talk. Now, lots of people think that this call has become a proxy for NVIDIA, this is NVIDIA’s foundry. If it’s strong, Nvidia flies. Now, that linkage is now antediluvian and it hasn’t held up under closed scrutiny in the last couple of quarters. Well, I’m going to listen but this time only for the color on the entire semiconductor space. Not as a one-for-one for Nvidia.” Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) specializes in manufacturing, packaging, testing, and selling integrated circuits and other semiconductor products. During March 24’s episode of Squawk on the Street, Cramer remarked: “Stargate and Taiwan Semi are the two that matter the most. Taiwan Semi if they can build the two-nano, the small ones, not the large ones that go into cars. If Taiwan Semi works out, then that’s a hedge against what we read about every day in the papers about what the Chinese government is doing.” Overall, TSMranks 11thon our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) announced on Monday that it had agreed to sell a 51% stake in Altera, the FPGA specialist it acquired in 2015, to investment firm Silver Lake.  While Intel will retain a 49% stake in the company, it will relinquish operational control as Altera becomes an independent, pure-play FPGA provider.

We recently published a list of10 AI Stocks on the Move. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks on the move. Market uncertainty aside, the AI race is tighter than ever. A report by Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) states that not only has the battlefield become tighter, but also more crowded than previously. The report notes that Google and OpenAI are neck to neck in the race to build cutting-edge AI, and that other companies are fiercely closing in. Meta, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI are a few of these names. Chinese competitors are also closing in on the AI race. In particular, DeepSeek’s R1 model is very close to the top-performing models of two of the leading AI companies. “It creates an exciting space. It’s good that these models are not all developed by five guys in Silicon Valley. Chinese models are catching up as far as performance to the US models..but across the globe, there are new players emerging in the space.” In recent news, OpenAI has launched its new AI model GPT-4.1, along with smaller versions GPT-4.1 mini and GPT-4.1 nano. These models boast major improvements in coding, instruction following, and long context comprehension. READ NOW:10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid Market Volatilityand14 AI Stocks Catching Wall Street’s Attention According to OpenAI, the models outperform the company’s most advanced GPT-4o model across the board and are available only on OpenAI’s application programming interface (API). In particular, the GPT-4.1 brags a 21% improvement over GPT-4o and 27% over GPT-4.5 on coding. Moreover, there are improvements in instruction following and long context comprehension, which make these models a better choice for powering AI agents. “Benchmarks are strong, but we focused on real-world utility, and developers seem very happy.” OpenAI also noted that these models operate at a “much lower cost” compared to GPT-4.5, and that the company would turn off the GPT-4.5 preview that is available in the API in July because the new models offer “improved or similar performance.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points  (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. On April 14,Reutersreported that the company is planning to build AI servers worth as much as $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years. Seeking help from partners such as TSMC, the announcement includes production of its Blackwell AI chips at TSMC’s factory in Phoenix, Arizona, and supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas by Foxconn and Wistron. Analysts believe that the move aligns with those of tech firms who have pledged to bring manufacturing back to the US. “It is unlikely Nvidia would have moved any production to the U.S. if it was not for pressure from the Trump administration. The half a trillion number is likely hyperbole, in the same way Apple made a half a trillion promise.” CEO Jensen Huang said that his company sees little short-term impact from higher U.S. tariffs. Nevertheless, they would move production to the U.S. in the longer term. “Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency.” Overall, NVDAranks 3rdon our list of AI stocks on the move. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Might Northrop Grumman stock be better than Boeing, too? Nvidia's announcement brings Big Tech’s investment pledges to US AI infrastructure to just north of $1.6 trillion since Trump's inauguration. Nvidia did not warn at least some major customers in advance about new U.S. export rules it was told about a week ago requiring it to obtain licenses to sell its China-focused artificial intelligence chip, according to two sources familiar with the matter.  The U.S. chipmaker disclosed on Tuesday that American officials had informed the company on April 9 that its H20 chip would require an export license for sales to China.

We came across abullish thesison UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) on Substack by Oguz Erkan. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on UNH. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH)'s share was trading at $587.06 as of April 14th. UNH’s trailing and forward P/E were 37.85 and 19.72 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. Valeri Potapova/Shutterstock.com UnitedHealth Group stands as a powerful compounder in the healthcare space, benefiting from the defensive nature of health insurance—a category of spending that consumers prioritize even during economic downturns. In uncertain times, discretionary expenses like tech upgrades, dining out, and travel are often the first to go, but health insurance remains untouchable due to the catastrophic financial consequences of going uninsured. This dynamic gives health insurers, especially UnitedHealth, exceptional pricing power, allowing them to pass on rising costs without losing customers. UnitedHealth’s dominance is underpinned by its vertical integration, particularly through its health services arm, Optum, which continues to grow at a healthy clip above 10% annually. Despite recent concerns sparked by the tragic death of its insurance CEO and skepticism voiced by Bill Ackman regarding profitability, the company’s fundamentals remain unshaken. These events created temporary dislocations in the stock, which long-term believers used as buying opportunities. UnitedHealth’s revenue has compounded at 11% annually over the past five years, and despite modest net profit and return on equity margins at 5%, the consistency and resilience of its business model position it as a reliable performer in all market conditions. Its forward P/E of 20 reflects a fair valuation, especially considering the current environment. The stock has already gained 22% year-to-date, outperforming a declining S&P 500, and still presents a compelling opportunity for investors—particularly on any dip below the $550 level. For those seeking tariff-proof exposure with strong cost-passing capabilities and a resilient growth engine, UnitedHealth remains a top-tier choice. The combination of its indispensable service, stable financials, and strategic integration make it a long-term winner, regardless of market cycles.

Currently,CVS HealthCVS andUnitedHealth GroupUNH are two major vertically integrated behemoths in the U.S. healthcare market and key constituents of the S&P 500 index. Both companies have transformed beyond their original identities — CVS Health from a retail pharmacy chain into a healthcare powerhouse through its acquisition of Aetna and UnitedHealth from a traditional insurer into a tech-enabled care provider via its expansive Optum platform. Each now combines insurance, care delivery, pharmacy benefit management (PBM) and value-based service models to offer end-to-end healthcare solutions. For investors, it is difficult to choose between the two, as both CVS and UnitedHealth continue to diversify their revenue streams and scale up their clinical and digital infrastructure. While they share structural similarities in business segmentation — insurance, health services, and pharmacy operations — their financial trajectories, operating margins, capital deployment strategies and risk exposures differ notably. Let’s examine which is the stronger buy right now. After a rough 2024, marked by high utilization at its Aetna insurance unit as well as reimbursement pressure, CVS Health has experienced a dramatic recovery so far in 2025. The stock has become the S&P 500’s top performer, with a year-to-date return of 56%, thereby outperforming all other index members by a significant margin. UnitedHealth, on the other hand, is at number 16 on the chart with a 16.5% gain. The stocks, however, outperformed the benchmark’s 8% dip during this period. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Aetna Margin Recovery and Cost Efficiencies in Focus:CVS Health is prioritizing margin recovery in its Aetna business, which posted 23% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter despite an adjusted operating loss. Favorable reserve developments and less severe-than-expected medical trends supported the performance. For 2025, CVS Health projects $132 billion in healthcare benefits revenues and at least $1.5 billion in adjusted operating income, with a 100-basis-point Medical Benefit Ratio improvement to 91.5%. While Medicare Advantage and individual exchange membership may decline, these are expected to be offset by growth in commercial self-insured plans and stronger plan design. The company is also executing a $2 billion multi-year cost efficiency initiative with 2025 savings expected to fully absorb rising variable expenses. Strong Cash Flow Generation and Shareholders’ Return:CVS Health’s 2024 operating cash flow of $9.1 billion exceeded expectations due to early cash receipts from the pharmacy segment. While 2025 guidance projects $6.5 billion in cash flow from operations, the two-year outlook of $15.6 billion in cumulative operating cash flows is a strong indicator of financial stability and flexibility. The company returned $3.3 billion in dividends in 2024 and expects to maintain dividend payments in 2025. It executed debt management strategies to moderately reduce leverage despite interest expense headwinds, with a long-term focus on regaining investment-grade targets. Reimbursement Issues, Cyberattack Fail to Mar UNH's Momentum:In 2024, UnitedHealth faced substantial external pressure in the form of CMS Medicare rate cuts, Medicaid redeterminations and the Change Healthcare cyberattack. Despite these, the company deployed nearly $17 billion in growth capital to further strengthen its capabilities. It also returned over $16 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, highlighting the company's financial strength and disciplined capital allocation. For 2025, UnitedHealth expects cash flow from operations to approach $33 billion, or 1.2x net income — a clear sign of robust underlying profitability. UNH's Shift Toward Value-Based Care with Optum:Optum Health’s revenues are set to grow from $105 billion in 2024 to $117 billion in 2025, with value-based care reaching 5.4 million patients, up 650,000 driven by services like in-home care. Optum Rx expects revenue growth with 98% retention and 750 new clients, expanding in specialty and infusion services while curbing drug costs. Bullish Outlook for 2025 and Beyond: UnitedHealth cut its 2024 operating cost ratio by 150 basis points, aided by early AI-driven productivity gains. It is also moving to fully transparent pharmacy rebate models by 2028 to strengthen client trust. Despite a 150-basis-point medical care ratio (MCR) variance in 2024, UNH has proactively priced for 2025, targeting an 86.5% +/-50 bps MCR, supported by strong retention, growing Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) adoption and broader managed care offerings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVS’ 2025 earnings per share suggests an 8.7% improvement from 2024. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNH’s 2025 EPS implies an improvement of 7.5% over the previous fiscal. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research CVS is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing healthcare stocks, of 11.25X, above its 5-year median of 9.25X and pretty close to the 5-year high of 13.33X. Meanwhile, UNH is presently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings of 19.06X, which is below its 5-year median and high of 19.20X and 26.63X respectively. This suggests that while UNH may appear slightly elevated relative to CVS, it remains attractively valued when compared with its own historical average. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research While both companies present compelling long-term value, UNH, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, currently stands out with stronger margins, cash flow, and a below-average P/E despite growth across Optum. CVS Health, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, meanwhile, is grappling with challenges like elevated medical costs and shifting payer dynamics in Medicare Advantage. The company recently established a \"baseline with upside potential\" strategy, signaling cautious optimism and operational discipline.

Analysts on Wall Street project that UnitedHealth Group (UNH) will announce quarterly earnings of $7.27 per share in its forthcoming report, representing an increase of 5.2% year over year. Revenues are projected to reach $111.01 billion, increasing 11.2% from the same quarter last year. The current level reflects an upward revision of 0.1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period. Ahead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock. While it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights. Given this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific UnitedHealth metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts. Analysts expect 'Revenues- Products' to come in at $13.33 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +11.9%. The average prediction of analysts places 'Revenues- Services' at $9.76 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +9.8% year over year. According to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Revenues- Premiums' should come in at $86.94 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +11.5%. Analysts' assessment points toward 'Revenues- Investment and other income' reaching $1.06 billion. The estimate points to a change of +4.4% from the year-ago quarter. Analysts predict that the 'Operating Statistics - Medical Care Ratio' will reach 85.9%. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 84.3%. The combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'UnitedHealthcare Customer Profile - People Served - Commercial - Domestic- Risk-based' will likely reach 9 million. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 8.55 million in the same quarter of the previous year. The consensus estimate for 'UnitedHealthcare Customer Profile - People Served - Commercial - Domestic- Fee-based' stands at 21.46 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 20.87 million. Based on the collective assessment of analysts, 'UnitedHealthcare Customer Profile - People Served - Total Community and Senior' should arrive at 20.16 million. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 19.77 million in the same quarter of the previous year. The consensus among analysts is that 'UnitedHealthcare Customer Profile - People Served - Community and Senior - Medicare Advantage' will reach 8.21 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 7.76 million. The collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'UnitedHealthcare Customer Profile - People Served - Community and Senior - Medicaid' of 7.62 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 7.68 million. It is projected by analysts that the 'UnitedHealthcare Customer Profile - People Served - Community and Senior - Medicare Supplement (Standardized)' will reach 4.33 million. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 4.33 million in the same quarter of the previous year. Analysts forecast 'UnitedHealthcare Customer Profile - People Served - Medicare Part D stand-alone' to reach 2.81 million.

Key Points March 2025 might seem like ages ago in market years, as the Trump tariffs have rocked the market like few things before it. However, the trends in March are not so different from what's happening now, as consumer sentiment was rapidly weakening and fears of a recession were mounting before thetariffannouncement. Let's take a look at the two best-performingDow Jones Industrial Average(^DJI-0.38%)companies to see if they're worth buying today. Image source: Getty Images. UnitedHealth Group(UNH-0.59%)is one of the most resilient stocks on the market. Healthcare is considered a recession-proof industry, but health insurance is even more unaffected by the economy because people need coverage regardless. It's not a surprise, then, that investors have piled into the stock in March and have continued to do so through the tariff-related chaos of April. There was no major company-specific news out on UnitedHealth in March, and investors seem to be returning to the stock after it tumbled following the assassination of one of its executives in December 2024. UnitedHealth has been one of the rare winners on the stock market in April, gaining 15% thanks to a 5.06% increase in Medicare Advantage benchmarks and its reputation as a port in a storm during turbulent market times. Chevron(CVX-0.59%)might seem like a surprise on this list as the energy sector is typically highly sensitive to the economic cycle. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is800%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500. They just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now… *Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025 The source of Chevron's gains was a surprising one, as Reuters reported that the company was angling for a piece of the data center market, developing the sites and supplying the electricity for facilities. Data center demand is surging along with AI, and the energy to power it is at a premium. However, while that was a smart strategic move, it wasn't enough to keep the stock climbing in April as it fell sharply after tariffs were announced. Chevron will continue to be sensitive to the health of the global economy and oil prices.

We recently published a list ofJim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, described the 145% duty on China as so extreme that it essentially acts as an embargo rather than a conventional tariff. “We now have 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, a number that high frankly isn’t really a tariff. It’s more of an embargo. Almost nobody’s gonna pay that much of a markup. It’s a recipe for losing money.” READ ALSO10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar RecentlyandJim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks Cramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump’s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. “As a nation, shamefully, we’ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,” he said “I think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.” Cramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. “Yes, we have to take them on now or never,” he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept. “So the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it’s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it’s not worth it to go back… [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I’m actually thinking that might be where we’ For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 150 Commenting on how people are investing in light of tariffs, Cramer mentioned UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) and said: “Is the market reflecting any of this? No, but something else is happening too. People are investing in companies, just started yesterday, that don’t have all that much exposure to China or none. You can see it in healthcare, excluding drugs, which are still facing the possibility of their own set of tariffs. UnitedHealth Group and Humana are good examples. They were up once again. I mean it’s really incredible. Former up nearly 3%, The latter up 2%.” UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is a healthcare company that provides health benefit plans, care delivery, pharmacy services, and health management programs. It supplies software, consulting, and data products to businesses in the healthcare industry. Parnassus Investmentsstated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in itsQ4 2024 investor letter: “We sold two Health Care positions during the quarter, pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and insurerUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). UnitedHealth’s business model is becoming higher-risk, which coupled with slowing Medicare Advantage growth and regulatory uncertainty led to us exiting the position.

While we acknowledge the potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

UnitedHealth Group IncorporatedUNH is set to report first-quarter 2025 results on April 17, 2025, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is currently pegged at $7.27 per shareon revenues of $111.01 billion. See the ZacksEarnings Calendarto stay ahead of market-making news. First-quarter earnings estimates have remained stable over the past week. The bottom-line projection indicates an increase of 5.2% from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests year-over-year growth of 11.2%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research For the current year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth’s revenues is pegged at $451.24 billion, implying a rise of 12.7% year over year. Also, the consensus mark for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $29.73, implying a jump of around 7.5% on a year-over-year basis. UnitedHealthhas a robust history of surpassing earnings estimates, beating the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters, with the average surprise being 2.5%. This is depicted in the figure below. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Quote However, our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for the company this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, but that’s not the case here. UNH has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. UnitedHealth's first-quarter earnings are expected to have benefited fromhigher premiums, driven by the expansion of its domestic commercial membership base. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premium revenues for the first quarter indicates 11.5% year-over-year growth, whereas our model estimate suggests a nearly 9% increase. Higher contributions from both Optum Health and UnitedHealthcare divisions are expected to have supported premium growth. UNH's first-quarter top-line performance is expected to have been enhanced by a rise inservice revenuesfrom the Optum brand. Both the consensus estimate and our model estimate imply a nearly 10% jump in service revenues. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate forproduct revenuesindicates an almost 12% increase. Value-based care expansion in Optum Health, new client wins at Optum Rx,and enhanced technology-enabled offerings are major tailwinds for the company’s results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from the Optum business segment suggests a 28.6% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from UnitedHealthcare indicates 7.6% year-over-year growth. These are expected to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth in the first quarter. Now, let’s focus onmembershipsin selected programs. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealthcare’s total domestic commercial customers suggests 3.5% year-over-year growth, whereas our estimate implies a nearly 2% gain. The consensus mark for Medicare Advantage members indicates a 5.8% year-over-year rise. However, the consensus estimate for Medicaid memberships implies a 0.8% decline from the year-ago level. Also, international memberships are expected to have declined in the quarter under review due to divestments. These are likely to have pulled total memberships down from the year-ago period. The consensus estimate implies a 0.6% fall year over year. Rising medical costs, as seniors continue resuming elective procedures,are expected to have elevated UnitedHealth’s overall expenses in the quarter. The expected growth in healthcare utilization, especially in the Medicare Advantage space, might have affected margins, making an earnings beat uncertain this time around. Our model estimate for total operating costs indicates an 8.6% increase from the prior-year period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNH’s medical care ratio is pegged at 85.92%, up from 84.3% in the year-ago quarter. Our estimates for medical costs and costs of products soldindicate 10% and 9.1% year-over-year increases, respectively. UnitedHealth's stock has jumped 18.5% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s growth of 18%. Its peers, such asHumana Inc.HUM andMolina Healthcare, Inc.MOH, have gained 16.3% and 18.6%, respectively, during this time. All these stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, which has plunged 9.1% during the same period. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Now, let’s look at the value UnitedHealth offers investors at current levels. The company’s valuation looks a bit stretched compared with the industry average. Currently, UNH is trading at 19.47X forward 12 months earnings, slightly above its five-year median of 19.20X and above the industry’s average of 16.71X. In comparison, Humana and Molina Healthcare are currently trading at 19.17X and 13.60X, respectively. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research UnitedHealth’s strategic investments in technology and value-based care — particularly through its Optum segment — continue to position the company as a frontrunner in healthcare innovation. This emphasis not only drives operational efficiency but also improves patient outcomes, a key advantage as the industry increasingly shifts toward quality-based models. With projected annual earnings growth of 12.4% over the next five years, UnitedHealth remains a compelling long-term investment. The company’s strong cash flow underpins consistent shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases, reinforcing its financial stability and disciplined capital allocation. Adding to the bullish case, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently approved a 5.06% increase in Medicare Advantage (MA) payments for fiscal 2026, a sharp revision from the initially proposed 2.23%. This development is expected to meaningfully boost profitability for top-tier MA providers like UnitedHealth and Humana. We anticipate that UnitedHealth will extend its profit growth trajectory in the upcoming earnings report, likely supporting continued stock price momentum. The company’s push toward managing costs effectively — through disciplined contract negotiations and optimized patient discharge processes — should further enhance margins. Given its strong fundamentals, long-term growth outlook, and favorable policy backdrop, UnitedHealth’s premium valuation appears justified. Investors may consider adding to their positions now.

Last Friday, the three most widely followed benchmark indexes closed a volatile yet winning week. The Nasdaq Composite, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 7.3%, 5.7% and 5%, respectively. Throughout the week, trade was influenced by tariff reprieves announced on European goods and a trade war between the United States and China. The S&P 500 and the Dow registered their biggest weekly percentage gains since November 2023, and the tech-focused Nasdaq claimed its biggest advance since November 2022. For March, inflation numbers both on the consumer and producer side came in negative, against expectations. Consumer sentiments, however, have declined further, and all eyes are currently set on developments from the White House and its multi-front tariff war.

While the Zacks Rank is our short-term rating system that is most effective over the one- to three-month holding horizon, the Zacks Recommendation aims to predict performance over the next 6 to 12 months. However, just like the Zacks Rank, the foundation for the Zacks Recommendation is trends in earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Recommendation classifies stocks into three groups — Outperform, Neutral and Underperform. While these recommendations are determined quantitatively, our analysts have the flexibility to override them for the 1100+ stocks they closely follow based on their better judgment of factors such as valuation, industry conditions and management effectiveness than the quantitative model.

Earnings season is always exciting for investors, with companies finally pulling the curtain back and unveiling what’s happened behind the scenes. Guidance is notably more critical this reporting cycle, given the recent tariff-induced spooks that we’ve become accustomed to. Importantly, several notable large-cap stocks are reporting this week, a list that includes Progressive PGR and UnitedHealth UNH. As shown below, PGR and UNH shares have shown great relative strength in 2025. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s take a closer look at what to expect from each. UnitedHealth Group offers a full spectrum of health benefits, with its Optum segment using data and technology to improve care delivery and health outcomes. UNH is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the earnings estimate revisions trend for its upcoming release largely stable over recent months. Top line revisions have also primarily remained stable, with the company expected to see 5% EPS growth on 11% higher sales. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Shares presently trade at a 19.5X forward 12-month earnings multiple, in line with the five-year median and beneath a 26.6X five-year high. The current PEG ratio works out to 1.6X, above the 1.4X five-year median and off modestly from 1.9X five-year highs. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Progressive is one of the largest auto and property insurers in the U.S., known for its direct-to-consumer model and strong underwriting performance. The company offers various insurance products, including auto, home, renters, and commercial lines. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with earnings expectations moving higher across the board. As shown below, the revisions trend for the upcoming print has been notably bullish, up 27% over the last 60 days. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Revenue revisions have remained stagnant, with PGR expected to see a big 27% year-over-year increase in EPS on nearly 20% higher sales. The company has been a star earnings performer overall, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by an average of 18% across its last four releases. Shares presently trade at a 17.6X forward 12-month earnings multiple, which compares to a 19.3X five-year median and 31.9X five-year highs. The stock sports a Style Score of ‘C’ for Value. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Bottom Line The 2025 Q1 earnings season picks up considerably this week, with large-cap companies Progressive PGR and UnitedHealth UNH partly headlining the reporting docket. Guidance will be key from both companies, but it’s worth mentioning that both companies are largely insulated from tariff worries thanks to their domestic operations, reflecting a key differentiator in today’s political climate.

He noted the chaotic nature of the current environment and remarked that “this tape has it all,” and emphasized how unpredictable developments from the White House have added to the turbulence. Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes. “Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,” he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, “Except this isn’t an eight-part blockbuster, it’s our money.” Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday’s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic. Cramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a “liberation day bottom,” a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, “Not sure, I’m just not sure.” He added: “Have you ever noticed the weekends don’t provide relaxation anymore because the president’s got advisors? He’s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He’s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime…. Monday’s trading, well, let’s just say that it looks like that it’s earning season so it’s gonna be even harder than usual.” For this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.

      "content": "Let PharmaVoice’s free newsletter keep you informed on what industry leaders are saying, straight from your inbox.  Brian Thompson’s murder has raised questions about the cost of U.S. healthcare, embroiling insurers, drugmakers and PBMs in a battle for the future of the industry. What started as the shocking murder of a healthcare executive has now become a watershed moment for an entire industry. Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was gunned down in December while walking along a Manhattan sidewalk. After an intense manhunt, the suspected assailant was caught and identified as Luigi Mangione. The case against 26-year-old Mangione, which includes state and federal charges, is moving swiftly. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced earlier this month that the Justice Department willseek the death penaltyagainst Mangione, who allegedly wrote the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” on shell casings used in the murder of the health insurance executive. Mangione’s lawyers have since asked a federal judge toblock the DOJ’s attemptat capital punishment. And while Mangione’s courtroom drama unfolds, the slaying’s impact is still rippling through the healthcare industry, from payers to pharma. News of the murder uncorked long-simmering outrage across the country over insurer profits and patients’ struggles to pay for healthcare. Scrutiny of UnitedHealth — the largest U.S. health insurance company — has quickly intensified. With a market capitalization ofover $400 billion, UnitedHealth brings in as much revenue as the tech giant Apple. Launched in the 1970s in Minnesota, the insurance companybuilt its empirethrough a string of deals that expanded its reach. Several large acquisitions deepened United’s investment into the Medicare coverage field. It also swallowed up several insurance competitors, bought hundreds of surgical sites, became a player in the home health industry and launched a pharmacy benefit manager called Optum Rx. Throughout its history, UnitedHealth has been embroiled in controversies that include antitrust suits and astock manipulation scandalin 2006 that led its CEO to resign. Before Thompson was murdered, UnitedHealth was beinginvestigated by the DOJfor potential antitrust activities, and PBMs in general have beenunder a microscopefrom U.S. lawmakers over their role in drug pricing. Now, more revelations have turned the heat up on UnitedHealth’s business dealings in the fraught U.S. healthcare system. A range of policymakers and regulators are unpacking more about the company’s far-reaching business — and United is fighting back by blaming the pharma industry and other players in healthcare. Meanwhile, industry executives have been shoring up security as distrust and criticisms of the industry mount. The killing of a chief executive shed light on the disparities inherent in a system that rewards corporate profit-seeking while leaving millions of patients unable to afford life-saving medications. Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the PharmaVoice free daily newsletter Before Thompson’s assassination, UnitedHealth was raking in billions from price hikes from 2017 to 2022 on drugs for patients with conditions like heart disease and cancer, according to areportfrom the Federal Trade Commission. Along with fellow PBMs Cigna and CVS Health, drug markups with percentages sometimes in the thousands drove revenue of $7.3 billion above what they paid for the drugs in the first place, the regulator said. Investigators have found that these companies allegedly continue to pump up revenues through extralegal means. Anaudit in Tennesseerevealed that Cigna’s Express Scripts in 2023 mishandled transactions with pharmacies to keep from paying reimbursements. UnitedHealth has also raked in profit from government insurers like Medicare. Through Medicare Advantage, PBMs madeabout $33 billionin 2021 from coding diagnoses that exaggerated patients’ conditions to pull in more from the program, and UnitedHealth made up about half of those additional payments, according to a report in the Annals of Internal Medicine. In response to the scrutiny, United hasn’t conceded much with its business model. Instead, the insurance giant has blamed the pharma industry. During the company’s end-of-year earnings call in January, UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty pointed to the high cost of drugs in the U.S. compared to other countries and specifically called out GLP-1 drugmakers, noting that “one drug whichcosts $900 in the U.S.costs about a tenth of that in Europe.” He also defended the role of Optum Rx in negotiating “many tens of billions of dollars in savings” for patients and passing through 98% of rebates directly to patients. Beyond drug prices, Witty said that hospitals benefit from higher costs for healthcare services. The comments came as the company declaredrecord revenues in 2024that topped $400 billion. In the months since, United has made at least one notable change on the PBM side: Optum Rx willstop requiring reauthorizationsfor around 80 drugs. The move will eliminate some paperwork burdens for physicians and patients and cut about 10% of Optum’s prior authorizations, the PBM said in March. Prior authorizations, which require providers to receive approval from a patient’s insurance plan before providing a service or drug, are a majorsource of discontentamong providers and patients. UnitedHealthcare also said last month that it planned toreduce 10%of prior authorizations this year. While much of the public ire related to the Thompson murder has been directed at health insurers, a range of companies are investing in beefed up security for their top executives. Over 70% of companies across industries have security plans in place for their top leaders, according to a surveyconducted by HR Policy Associationreleased earlier this year. While 37% focus their security efforts solely on the CEO, nearly 70% provide protection for all C-suite executives, and most use third-party contractors. Over half of the 180 respondents to the survey said they are prioritizing security for travel and physical safety in 2025. In pharma, the increased emphasis on safety was acutely felt at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco in January, which is one of the industry’s largest events of the year. The San Francisco Police Departmentadded barriersand checkpoints to the event’s main hub — the Westin St. Francis hotel — and canceled some officers’ days off to make sure the event was fully staffed. Proxy statements released this year have also revealed just how much large pharmas are shelling out to protect their executives. About $960,000 of Moderna’sCEO pay packagefor Stéphane Bancel was used for security in 2024. Pfizer spentmore than $661,000to protect CEO Albert Bourla, while Gilead Sciencesreportedmore than $285,000 in security services for CEO Daniel O’Day. In general,other large pharmas— including Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly — spent between $70,000 and $200,000 on CEO security last year.

We recently published a list of the11 Best Dividend Paying Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other best dividend-paying stocks. Dividend-paying stocks have consistently attracted investor interest due to their long-term value. CNBC highlights this by examining the historical performance of the broader market. Between 1960 and 2024, a $10,000 investment in the index would have grown to over $982,000 purely from stock price appreciation, based on data from FactSet and NYU Stern. However, many companies in the index also returned capital to shareholders through dividends. Had an investor reinvested those dividends over the years, the investment would have ballooned to approximately $6.42 million by the beginning of 2025. This outlook seems reasonable, especially when considering how crucial cash flow has become in today’s economic environment. Investors continue to favor income-generating assets, and dividends remain one of the most reliable ways to deliver that income. Reflecting this trend, several companies within the market have recently introduced dividend payments. According to S&P Global, companies in the S&P index now contribute roughly 85% of the total dividends paid across the market—up from 82% in 2024. This increase includes 2.7% of the total dividend pool coming from firms that only recently began issuing dividends. The top 29 companies in the index alone are responsible for 40% of all dividends paid by the index’s constituents and 35% of the total dividends across the entire US equity market. Under the current base-case forecast, these leading firms are expected to distribute a combined $280 billion in dividends. In a more optimistic (upside) scenario, that figure could climb by 2.75% to $288 billion, with major large cap companies projected to deliver the most significant gains by weighted average. If the most favorable (bull-case) conditions materialize, these 29 companies could boost total dividend payouts by an estimated 4.5%, contributing an additional 1% themselves. It’s no surprise, then, that dividends have become a central theme in many investors’ strategies. According to Brian Bollinger, founder of Simply Safe Dividends, focusing on companies that regularly pay dividends can offer a sense of reassurance. He further noted that younger investors, in particular, have the opportunity to build long-term dividend growth portfolios aimed at maximizing total return and capital appreciation over time. According to Nuveen, companies that focus on dividend growth tend to possess strong long-term fundamentals and may deliver relatively attractive performance in the year ahead. Historically, firms that consistently increased or initiated dividend payments have produced higher annualized returns and exhibited lower volatility compared to the broader equity market. While such companies may not lead in every market environment, their favorable risk-adjusted returns over extended periods make them a solid foundation for equity portfolios. Nuveen also suggested that many firms remain in a strong position to continue raising dividends over time. In the US, corporate balance sheets are generally healthy, consumer spending remains steady, and earnings growth is projected to pick up pace in 2025. Data from FactSet shows that dividends per share for the S&P index rose by 7.6% in 2024, with consensus forecasts pointing to a further 4.2% increase in 2025.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 150 UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is an American health insurance company. It is well-positioned for steady growth thanks to its broad-based business model, which spans health insurance, pharmacy benefit management, and healthcare services. This integrated setup not only enhances care efficiency but also boosts cross-selling opportunities. The stock is returning strong returns this year, surging by nearly 19% since the start of 2025. Analysts have praised the company’s ability to trim its operating cost ratio, which dropped to 13.2% in 2024 from 14.7% the previous year, largely due to strategic adjustments in its business portfolio—moves that support long-term profitability. In fiscal 2024, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) surpassed investor expectations, with revenue climbing 8% to $400 billion, supported by solid performance across all service areas. Operating earnings came in at $32.3 billion, and after accounting for expenses tied to a cyberattack and difficulties in South America, adjusted earnings totaled $34.4 billion. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) also maintained robust cash flow, generating $24.2 billion in operating cash flow, equivalent to 1.6 times its net income. It returned more than $16 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. The company’s return on equity reached 23.7% in the fourth quarter, reflecting both strong earnings and effective capital allocation. UnitedHealth paid a quarterly dividend of $2.10 per share, yielding 1.40%, as of April 12. The company has consistently paid dividends since 2010. Overall, UNHranks 2ndon our list of the best dividend paying stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

This summer, UnitedHealth, Amedisys and antitrust regulators will have a magistrate judge’s help in hashing out a solution to the DOJ’s opposition to the merger. UnitedHealth’s health services divisionOptum first announced plans to buy Amedisysin summer 2023 after a bidding war over the Louisiana-based home health and hospice provider. Amedisys shareholders approved the deal later that year. However, the merger has been held up by antitrust regulators, who say UnitedHealth’s ownership of LHC Group, a rival to Amedisys thatUnitedHealth acquired for $5.4 billionin 2023, is cause for concern. If the transaction goes through, Optum will control 30% or more of the home health or hospice markets in eight states, the DOJ said in its complaint. The deal will also add 500 care sites to Optum’s home health and hospice portfolio and extend its reach into five additional states, harming patients and providers by eliminating competition, according to the DOJ. UnitedHealth and Amedisys, which deny that their merger would have anticompetitive effects, haveoffered plans to divest businessesto ameliorate the DOJ’s concerns. Most recently, UnitedHealth and Amedisys offered to sell more than 120 home health and hospice facilities, accordingto a court filing in February. If the sales are approved, UnitedHealth would only operate 10% of home health and 4% of hospice services in the U.S. Still, the offers have not proved sufficient for the DOJ, which has grown increasingly concerned about the size and influence of UnitedHealth — a company that operates one of the largest insurers in the nation, a major pharmacy benefit manager and a healthcare technology company, while employing thousands of physicians. The DOJ is reportedly investigatingthe conglomerate for its potential anticompetitive effects, including the relationship between Optum and its insurer UnitedHealthcare.

We recently published a list of10 Best Medical Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other best medical stocks to buy according to billionaires. Some experts view medical, healthcare, and big pharma stocks as immune from trade carnage, making them a safe haven amid the uncertainty brought about by Trump’s tariffs. On April 8, Mizuho Securities America healthcare sector strategist Jared Holz appeared on CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ to talk about whether the speculations around the healthcare sector being a safe haven during market turmoil are true. He also discussed why healthcare companies are failing to get increased investor respect, given that healthcare is 20% of the American economy, which translates to around 1/5th of the country’s entire national output. Holz said that the country’s major healthcare and pharmaceutical companies undoubtedly help fight its healthcare problems. However, when we look at their financial models and the way their businesses are currently set up, we have got generic patent cliffs over the next 5-7 years on the medium to long-term angle of the company, along with price concessions with the IRA and some of the things the Biden administration put into place. We have also got pricing degradation over the near term, and between those two lies competition and other setbacks. The models thus never line up well enough for investors to have a lot of confidence, as the business models do not lend themselves to long-term viability. These are the primary reasons the sector and stocks have been under pressure for so long. READ ALSO:10 Best Mid Cap Biotech Stocks to Buyand12 Best Diagnostics Stocks to Invest In Right Now. Holz further opined that managed care, particularly the government-centric names, are somewhat safe as they are insulated from tariffs as US-based companies. In fact, the economic slowdown is actually beneficial for them as they want less utilization and less patience through the system, which is how they typically beat numbers. He said that managed care is having a good day, and investors might think about owning some companies in the sector. It is, however, a relative game, as there are several different variables at play, and investors are essentially playing a game of hopscotch in an attempt to jump from one area to another, whether it’s tariffs, drug pricing, or other public policies. He painted a similar picture for medical device stocks that are more US-centric. These two sectors thus have less risk relative to others, making them somewhat of a safe haven. In this article, we first sifted through ETFs and financial media reports to compile a preliminary list of stocks. We then examined Insider Monkey’s exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to select the 10 best medical stocks with the most billionaire investors. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades. Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us. Below, we take a look atUnitedHealth Group (UNH), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score. It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. UnitedHealth Group currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period. You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>> Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for UNH that show why this largest U.S. health insurer shows promise as a solid momentum pick. A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area. For UNH, shares are up 14.17% over the past week while the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry is up 1.21% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 22.68% compares favorably with the industry's 2.76% performance as well. While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of UnitedHealth Group have risen 17.6%, and are up 36.49% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved -7.64% and 4.64%, respectively. Investors should also pay attention to UNH's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. UNH is currently averaging 5,807,295 shares for the last 20 days. The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with UNH. Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost UNH's consensus estimate, increasing from $29.63 to $29.73 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period. Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that UNH is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep UnitedHealth Group on your short list. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We recently published a list of11 Top Performing European Stocks So Far In 2025.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (NASDAQ:CCEP) stands against other best performing European stocks to invest in. The world economy is hanging by a thread, as the macroeconomic environment consists of trade wars, retaliatory tariffs, and political unrest in Ukraine and the Middle East. It adds to economic uncertainty, with market experts offering cautious economic forecasts. According to EY, the euro area will experience a modest economic turnaround in 2025, and growth is expected to increase from 0.7% last year to 1.3% and 1.8% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. It is forecasted to simmer down to 1.4% in 2027. Among all European countries, Malta is projected to experience the highest GDP growth in 2025 at 4%. EY expects soft employment growth across Europe, driven by demographic challenges and subdued labor demand. Unemployment will likely remain at 2024 levels. While nominal wage this year will clock in higher than pre-pandemic levels, wage growth will take a hit. Central and Eastern European countries are forecasted to experience relatively higher inflation in 2025, while the overall rate remains just over 2% in the euro area. Meanwhile, German economic institutes have slashed their growth projections for 2025 to 0.1% from the previous forecast of 0.8% in September 2024. This revised estimate does not incorporate the recent tariffs levied by the US. These tariffs will be a major setback for European economies, possibly toppling them over the edge of recession for the third consecutive year. The new conservative government declared a €500 billion fund to improve infrastructure and defence and stimulate growth. The fiscal package enhances the economic outlook for 2026 and 2027. However, as the United States is feeling the pressure from high valuations and growing political instability, analysts are looking towards Europe as a better bet for stock investors. Analysts point towards Europe offering a more stable outlook, with lower stock prices, clearer policy direction, and even potential interest rate cuts on the horizon. Investors seem to be shifting their focus, partly because the threat of US tariffs on Europe, especially on automobiles, feels less uncertain now that details are clearer. There is also less exposure to tech in Europe, which is seen as a good thing right now. Europe’s markets, with just 10% tech exposure in the Europe 600 compared to 30% in the broader market, look more balanced. With solid earnings, rising share buybacks, and cheaper stock valuations, investors are turning to Europe. Experts suggest that European and UK markets now have their best shot in years at outperforming the US. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the best-performing stocks in Europe so far in 2025. A woman pouring a freshly made beverage from a large-scale bottling line.

Key Points Warren Buffett is famous because of the long-term success he has achieved runningBerkshire Hathaway. But there are two interesting things about this company. First, it is run kind of like a mutual fund. Second, it doesn't pay dividends despite the fact that Buffett often invests in dividend-paying companies. Here's why that matters and why you might want to buy one of these three dividend payers he owns. One of the core tenets ofBuffett's investment approachis to buy good companies when they are attractively priced. But the next step is to hold for the long term so he can benefit from the growth of the businesses he buys. One of the nuances that gets lost in this is that he uses the cash generated from the companies he owns outright or owns in Berkshire Hathaway's common stock portfolio to reinvest in his business. That allows him to compound those cash flows over time and this enhances the returns he generates for investors. Image source: The Motley Fool. From a big-picture perspective, you can do the same thing bydividend reinvesting. All it takes is a phone call to your broker, or, more likely, a button press on your broker's website or in its app. And in one quick and easy move you'll be investing more like Warren Buffett. But what if you want to invest even more like Oracle of Omaha? Well, three dividend-paying stocks he owns today areCoca-Cola(KO-0.76%),Chevron(CVX-0.59%), andKraft Heinz(KHC-1.26%). Here's a look at these three Buffett stocks to see if they'll be a good fit for your Buffett style dividend reinvesting. Coca-Cola is a very easy company to like. It is the industry-leading beverage company with a globally diversified business. It is large enough to have economies of scale in distribution, marketing, and research and development, and it can, and does, act as an industry consolidator. The dividend has been increased annually for over five decades, making ita Dividend King. The dividend yield is 2.9%, which is well above the market's yield today. For conservative dividend investors it is a solid choice. The only problem is that the stock looks a little expensive at the moment, with both the price-to-sales andprice-to-earningsratios above their five-year averages. However, if you are willing to pay a premium for income security, Coca-Cola could be a good fit for your portfolio. Another industry leader in Buffett's portfolio isenergygiant Chevron. It is one of the largest integrated energy companies you can buy, with a business that spans from the upstream (energy production) through the midstream (pipelines) and into the downstream (chemicals and refining). This diversification helps to soften the impact of the inherent swings in the commodity-driven energy sector. On top of that, the company has a very strong balance sheet, which allows it to take on leverage during industry downturns to support its business and dividend. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is800%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500. They just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now… *Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025 The dividend, notably, has been increased annually for 38 years thanks largely to Chevron's solid business model. That said, energy price volatility still has a material impact on the stock price. Right now energy prices are weakening andthe dividend yieldis a very attractive 4.7%. The yield could go higher if oil prices continue to fall. But the history here suggests that the dividend will continue to get paid even if oil prices continue to fall. You could try to time your entry into Chevron, but the truth is it is a strong energy choice at just about any point of the energy cycle. The last big dividend stock on this list is Kraft Heinz. It is a toughconsumer staples stockto love when you compare it to Coca-Cola. Yes, Kraft Heinz's dividend yield is a lofty 5.3%, but the dividend has been static since it was cut in 2019. The big story is the business overhaul that's taking place. The company was created via the merger between Kraft and Heinz. The goal at that time was to cut costs to boost profitability. But cutting costs can only take a company so far before it needs to refocus on growth. That's what Kraft Heinz has been doing, after turning to a new management team. But the results haven't been particularly impressive, which is why the dividend has been stuck in neutral for so long. If you consider this high-yield food maker you'll need to go in understanding that it is aturnaroundstory that will require extra monitoring. It's probably only appropriate for more aggressive investors. While Buffett owns Coca-Cola, Chevron, and Kraft Heinz in his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, you don't actually need to own these specific stocks to benefit from dividend reinvestment. These are just three stocks to get you thinking about the real investment tool that's important here, which is the reinvestment of dividends so you can compound your returns over time -- just like Buffett does with his investments.

Coca-Cola(KO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +3.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.6% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coca-Cola belongs, has gained 1.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. Coca-Cola is expected to post earnings of $0.72 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged. The consensus earnings estimate of $2.96 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.19 indicates a change of +8.1% from what Coca-Cola is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Coca-Cola. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Coca-Cola, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $47.99 billion and $50.46 billion estimates indicate +2% and +5.1% changes, respectively. Coca-Cola reported revenues of $11.54 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.4%. EPS of $0.55 for the same period compares with $0.49 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.69 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.01%. The EPS surprise was +7.84%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Coca-Cola is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coca-Cola. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Key Points Investors are looking for solid dividend stocks with volatility returning to the markets. There are several top stocks offering yields much better than theS&P 500average of 1.44%, but some of these businesses are struggling competitively and are only offering high yields because their share prices have collapsed. It's ideal to find high-yield stocks of strong companies that are delivering solid financial results and showing share price appreciation potential. Here are two dividend payers that are doing just that. Coca-Cola(KO-0.76%)has historically weatheredrecessionswell. It has increased the dividend for 63 consecutive years after recently increasing its quarterly payment by 5% to $0.51. It's a great option for someone looking to boost their portfolio's average yield with relatively low risk. Coca-Cola generates a significant portion of its annual revenue from making concentrate syrup for its trademark brand. This is a capital-light business model that churns out robust profits. The company's profit margin has remained above 20% over the last five years. Despite choppy consumer spending behavior, global unit case volume grew 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 1% for 2024. The company continues to adjust its marketing strategy and capitalize on its knowledge of local markets globally to drive sales. The company has been particularly effective at linking its beverages to different occasions, such as music or food, that resonate with consumers. The stock has climbed 20% over the last year, and it currently offers aforward dividend yieldof 2.88%. Analysts expectCoca-Colato grow earnings at an annualized rate of 6% over the next several years. Combined with the high yield, investors can expect to earn an average annual return around 9%, which is slightly less than the historical return of the S&P 500 but with the advantage of earning a much higher dividend yield. Leading wireless service providers are very resilient in recessions. Eliminating a phone or internet payment plan is probably the last thing people are going to cut in a recession. Shares ofAT&T(T1.12%)have climbed about 59% over the last year, driven by healthy demand for wireless phone plans and high-speed internet service. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is800%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500. They just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now… *Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025 AT&T cut its dividend in 2022 to shore up funds to service its debt. The company's current quarterly dividend is $0.2775, bringing its forward yield to 4.2%. Instead of increasing its dividend, management has left the dividend unchanged as it focuses on paying down debt and investing for growth. It's normal for telecoms to use a lot of debt, since they benefit from regular monthly bills from customers, which provides a high level of certainty for annual revenue and cash flows. The company's debt has declined from $177 billion in 2021 to $123 billion in 2024, while paying out less than half itsfree cash flowin dividends over the past year. AT&T entered 2025 with momentum. It reported 1.7 million postpaid phone net additions last year, which refers to the monthly bills people pay for wireless service. The company also added 1 million AT&T Fiber net additions for the seventh consecutive year.It aims to keep pressure on competitors by focusing on delivering quality service and good deals. The company generated more than $17 billion in free cash flow last year on $122 billion of revenue. The 4.2% forward yield, combined with management's optimism that it can growAT&T's business to increase the share price, makes this an excellent income investment for 2025 and beyond.

Key Points Coca-Cola(KO-0.76%)is a famous company with an iconic brand known the world over. Operating in the consumer staples space, consumers tend to keep buying its products right through periods of stock market and economic turmoil. That's how Coca-Cola has managed to support and grow its dividend through the years despite often material headwinds. While Coca-Cola is an elite company, it is far from the only consumer staples maker that can help you rest easy amid stock market unrest. Here are a few others. If the stock market falls into a bear market are you going to stop buying toothpaste, toilet paper, and soda? If the economy succumbs to a recession, will you stop using soap, laundry detergent, and food? That answer, I hope, to those two questions is no. And this is whyconsumer staples makersare so attractive during troubled times (if not all the time). Image source: Getty Images. Many of the products that companies like Coca-Cola sell aren't actually necessities. In this case you could just drink tap water instead of soda. However, the cost of most consumer staples products is fairly modest while the benefits are material, even if those benefits are really just emotional. Brand loyalty tends to run high in the consumer staples niche. Even better, consumer staples products are bought frequently because they get used regularly. If you are having trouble sleeping at night amid market uncertainty, you should consider adding some more consumer staples stocks to your portfolio mix. Coca-Cola is a solid choice for highly conservative investors. It has an above-market dividend yield of 2.9% backed by a dividend that has been increased annually for more than 50 years, making this beverage gianta Dividend King. The company has a global distribution network, strong R&D skills, and massive marketing heft. The only problem is that the stock looks a little expensive right now, with its price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios both above their five-year averages. If you're willing to pay up for safety, you might want to buy Coca-Cola. ButbeveragepeerPepsiCo(PEP-2.69%)has similar business strengths and a more diversified portfolio that includes snacks and packaged foods. It is also a Dividend King. However, the real attraction lies in its valuation, with PepsiCo's P/S and P/E ratios both below their five-year averages. Its dividend yield is an even higher 3.7%. And with PepsiCo investing in growth through bolt-on acquisitions, it is continuing to grow its business with the same playbook that has worked well for more than five decades. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is800%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500. They just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now… *Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025 That said, you might want something a little different.Unilever(UL-0.27%)could be just what you are looking for, with its portfolio of consumer products and food. The big story with Unilever is that North America and Europe only make up around 40% of its top line, with the rest coming from Latin America and Asia, where economic growth is expected to be higher over the long term. Add in a 3.1%dividend yieldand this is an attractive consumer staples option for those with a more adventurous bent. Then there are ultra high yielders likeAltria(MO0.79%)andBritish American Tobacco(BTI0.67%). Both of these cigarette makers are facing material long-term headwinds as the volume of the cigarettes they sell has been in decline for years. However, smokers tend to be very loyal and often increase their use of cigarettes during uncertain times. During the coronavirus pandemic, both Altria and British American Tobacco put up their strongest volume numbers in years. While these twotobacco companiescome with material long-term risks, the short-term benefit of collecting Altria's 7.2% yield and British American Tobacco's 7.5% yield might be worth it for some investors. Given the nature of cigarettes, those lofty yields are likely to be safe over the near term. Although all of the companies listed here are attractive in their own way, the list is hardly exhaustive. There are many more consumer staples stocks that are worth looking at if you are worried about the market and feara recession. While there is no way to fully avoid the impact of either of these big-picture events, buying companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Unilever, Altria, and British American Tobacco can help ease your worries and let you rest a little better thanks to their reliable businesses and dividends.

We recently published a list ofJim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, described the 145% duty on China as so extreme that it essentially acts as an embargo rather than a conventional tariff. “We now have 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, a number that high frankly isn’t really a tariff. It’s more of an embargo. Almost nobody’s gonna pay that much of a markup. It’s a recipe for losing money.” READ ALSO10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar RecentlyandJim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks Cramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump’s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. “As a nation, shamefully, we’ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,” he said “I think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.” Cramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. “Yes, we have to take them on now or never,” he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept. “So the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it’s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it’s not worth it to go back… [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I’m actually thinking that might be where we’ For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

It also supplies beverage concentrates and syrups for sale through retail channels. During the episode, Cramer stated, “Utility, Verizon, perfect Coca-Cola, Waste Management. Yeah, these are timeless.” On March 31, during an episode of Squawk on the Street, Cramer mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and said: “In terms of shorting, like if you wanna short, do you short Coca-Cola? No, cause Coca-Cola in 2000, after the NASDAQ broke, was really a terrific stock to own… Look at that April 14th to April 17th 2000 period when we had this dramatic switch. Which was rather incredible, which was the fastest I’ve seen where Coca-Cola went from being a loser to a winner. I think we’re there. Coca-Cola’s having a good quarter.” Overall, KOranks 7thon our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of KO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar. On Thursday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer cautioned viewers about what may lie ahead once the 90-day pause on new tariffs comes to an end. While discussing the latest Consumer Price Index report, Cramer acknowledged that the numbers looked favorable, with inflation appearing relatively tame and even some categories experiencing actual price declines. He pointed to energy prices, saying, “The best, anything it touched energy, which is plummeting.” READ ALSO:Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocksand10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently. “This is essentially an embargo. President Trump’s ecstatic that the tariffs are already taking in $2 billion a day. He’s thrilled that supposedly 75 countries are begging for something more reasonable than the 90-day pause when the 90-day pause comes to an end.” According to Cramer, President Trump is “ecstatic” that these tariffs are already generating $2 billion a day in revenue and is thrilled about 75 countries “supposedly” asking for something more workable once the 90-day grace period concludes. Despite the seemingly positive revenue flow, Cramer expressed concern over the broader consequences. He pointed out that many Americans have yet to grasp the full impact of trade policies that have allowed foreign businesses to flood U.S. markets with inexpensive products, often pricing out domestic companies. While many consumers embraced the lower costs, Cramer reminded his audience that it came at the expense of American jobs. “Now we’re going to have to pay a price. He stressed that consumers should be prepared to pay significantly more for a wide range of goods. He said that the additional cost largely will likely benefit foreign companies, which will hike prices in response to the tariffs imposed on them. He clarified his position by stating he is not a staunch advocate of free trade for its own sake. “No other country plays by the rules on trade, so we shouldn’t either,” he said but cautioned: “We just have to be more thoughtful about this or we’ll end up doing more harm than good. Again, as someone who wants fair trade, not free trade, I am rooting for the president to pull this off, but not at the expense of great American companies that have done nothing wrong and are the best in the world.” For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10.

Key Points Economic forecasters are raising the odds that we could experience a recession in the coming quarters.Goldman Sachshas hiked its recession probability a few times in recent weeks, bumping it from 20%all the wayto 45%. Meanwhile,JPMorganis even more bearish. Its recession model sees a nearly 80% chance the economy goes into a recession, up from 60% not long ago. Recessions tend to cause corporate profits to decline, which drives many companies to cut costs through layoffs and other initiatives. Some companies will even cut or suspend theirdividend paymentsto shareholders to conserve cash. However, other companies are more recession-resistant due to the durability of their cash flows and the strength of their balance sheets.ExxonMobil(XOM-0.34%)andCoca-Cola(KO-0.76%)have proven their ability to weather recessions over the decades. They've both increased their dividends throughout at least the past four recessions. There's a good chance they can withstand the next one with similar ease.  XOM Dividenddata byYCharts. Gray bars are recessions. ExxonMobil hiked its dividend payment by 4% earlier this year, extending its streak to 42 years of annual payment increases. \"We're proudof the factthat we've increased our annual dividend per share for 42 years in a row, something only 4% ofS&P 500companies can claim,\" stated CFO Kathy Mikells during the oil giant's fourth-quarter earnings conference call. She continued, \"And we plan for that track record to continue for decadesto come, which is only possible by investing in the high-quality growthopportunities that drive leading returns and higher cash flows.\" The energy company has been investing heavily in transforming its business to dramatically improve its underlying earnings power whilealsoexpanding into lower-carbon energy. This strategy has boosted its earnings capacity by nearly $14 billion over the past five years on a constant price and margin basis. Exxon plans to invest over $140 billion into major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program through 2030, which, along with structural cost savings, should add another $20 billion to its annual earnings capacity. That incremental income will give Exxon even more fuel to grow its dividend, which is already on an incredibly safe foundation. Last year,Exxon produced $34.4 billion in free cash flow, easily covering its $16.7 billion dividend outlay. Meanwhile, it has a fortress balance sheet with an ultra-low 6%leverage ratioand a massive $23.2 billion cash balance. These factors put the oil giant's 3.8%-yielding dividend on a rock-solid foundation that should continue withstanding recessions. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is800%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500. They just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now… *Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025 Coca-Cola boosted its dividend payment by 5.2% earlier this year. That extended its dividend growth streak to 63 straight years. That raise kept Coca-Cola in the ultra-elite group ofDividend Kings, companies with 50 or more years of annual dividend increases. The company has benefited from the durable and growing demand for its beverage brands. Its portfolio features multiple billion-dollar brands that generate lots of free cash flow for the company. Coca-Cola expects to produce $9.5 billion in free cash flow this year, more than enough to cover its dividend outlay ($8.4 billion last year). The company also has a strong cash-rich balance sheet ($12.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments) with leverage at the low end of its target range. Coca-Cola's long-term target is to organically grow its revenue by 4%-6% annually, which should drive mid-to-high single-digit earnings-per-share growth. Meanwhile, the company can enhance its growth rate by making accretive acquisitions. That puts it in a strong position to continue increasing its2.9%-yieldingdividend. Exxon and Coca-Cola have increased their dividendsevery yearfor several decades,which includesthe last four recessions.They're in excellent positions to continue raising their payout during the next downturn, whetherthat happenslater this year orfurtherin the future.Because of that, they're great dividend stocks to buy for a durable passive income stream.

Delta TechOps announced on LinkedIn last week that it has signed a 10-year contract with UPS (NYSE: UPS) to service Pratt & Whitney PW2037 engines on UPS’ entire 757 fleet. Delta CEO Ed Bastian also disclosed the agreement during Delta’s first quarter-earnings briefing. “This is an exciting one for our MRO team and supports long-term revenue diversification and growth,” Bastian said. Both companies are headquartered in Atlanta. UPS operates 75 Boeing 757 freighters, according to a fact sheet on its website.  Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) is one of the largest maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) providers in North America. Other major airlines with their own maintenance units include American and Lufthansa. The companies inspect and maintain their own aircraft, and make extra money from outside customers. Last week, Pratt & Whitney announced an agreement to expand annual overhaul capacity by 30% for geared turbofan engines at Delta TechOps’ Atlanta facility over the next decade. The GTF engine is a newer type mostly used to power the Airbus A220 and A320 neo family of aircraft. The extra infrastructure will enable Delta to overhaul up to 450 of the engines per year.

For March, Volaris reported a 10.9% year-over-year increase in consolidated capacity (measured in available seat miles). The load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) decreased 2.4 percentage points to 84.4% on a consolidated basis. The metric fell as the increase in consolidated traffic (7.8%) was less than the increase in consolidated capacity. During the month, Volaris transported 2.6 million passengers, up 12.3% year over year. On the domestic front, revenue per mile (RPM) and available seat miles (ASMs) increased 9.9% and 13.3%, respectively, from March 2024 levels. The domestic load factor in March was 89.4%, a decrease of 2.8 percentage points from year-ago levels. In international markets, RPM increased 4.6% year over year, while ASM rose 7.6% year over year. 4. For March, LATAM Airlines reported a 7.2% year-over-year increase in consolidated capacity, measured in available seat kilometers. LTM’s revenue passenger kilometers increased 5.6% year over year despite the impact of the carnival holidays on Brazil’s domestic segment. The carnival took place in the month of March in 2025, whereas it was celebrated in February in 2024, affecting year-over-year comparability. Although traffic improved on a year-over-year basis, it failed to outpace capacity expansion. As a result, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) fell to 81.9% from 83.9% a year ago. 5. In a bid to revolutionize pilot training by leveraging extended reality technology, Alaska Air took a stake in Loft Dynamics, which is headquartered in Zürich, Switzerland, with an office in Santa Monica, CA.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The NYSE ARCA Airline Index increased by 2.6% to $59.58 as most airline stocks traded in the green over the past week. The upside followed President Donald Trump's announcement that he would pause the reciprocal import taxes for 90 days. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has decreased 16.5%. Amid the tariff-induced uncertainties, first-quarter 2025 earnings reports of many airlines are expected in the coming days. For example, Alaska Air is scheduled to report quarterly results on April 23. While its top line is likely to have been hurt by the slowdown in domestic air travel demand, the bottom line is expected to have been boosted by reduced fuel costs.

(Bloomberg) — Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup Inc. (C) slashed their estimates for 2025 earnings as companies kick off their first-quarter reports, joining a wave of Wall Street banks warning that tariffs will curb profit growth. Most Read from Bloomberg The Secret Formula for Faster Trains NYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six Even Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem Inside the Quiet, Extravagant Expansion of the Frick Collection Lisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City’s Housing Shortage Citi’s head of US equity strategy, Scott Chronert lowered his 2025 prediction for the S&P 500 to 5,800 from 6,500, predicated on earnings of $255 a share for companies in the index, down from a previous $270 projection. At Morgan Stanley, Mike Wilson cut his 2025 earnings-per-share forecast to $257 from $271. “The 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs and further concessions over the weekend lessen the near-term probability of a recession, but uncertainty remains high,” said Wilson, who sees the S&P 500 trading in a range from 5,000-5,500. The index finished last week at 5,363.36. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) has fallen 8.8% this year on concern that investors increasingly are shifting away from US assets. The selloff was worsened by Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs policy and the tit-for-tat spat with China. Investors are rushing to game out how the effective freezing of Chinese trade will impact companies and growth. Morgan Stanley’s Wilson warned that the S&P 500 could slump back below 5,000 and retest last week’s lows if 10-year Treasuries yields surge above 5% from the current 4.46%. A larger trade deal with China that significantly reduces tariffs still in place would cause significant upside, he said. Read: ‘No Place to Hide’ as Stress Spreads Across Assets: Taking Stock The first signs of a slowdown in global trade are already emerging as companies around the world hit their own pause button on orders. If anything, Trump is extending the uncertainty that has already begun to drag on business and consumer sentiment. “No doubt, the goldilocks sentiment in place entering this year has given way to abject uncertainty,” Chronert wrote in a note. “This is for good reason as the Trump administration’s announced tariff approach is set to disrupt” a global trade system that has developed since China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001. Companies’ attempts to pass through tariff-driven price increases threaten the US consumers’ incomes, who’s spending power has already been sapped by post-pandemic inflation. While a recession is not their base case, the probability for a mild one remains high, according to Chronert and Wilson. Some impacts are already visible. Delta Air Lines Inc. withdrew its full-year financial guidance due to uncertainty surrounding global trade last week. In a difficult environment, Wilson recommends looking for opportunities in industries where prices already reflect the risks, including transports, materials, semiconductors, autos and pharma/biotech as well as hardware, while leaning towards bearish bets in areas such as consumer discretionary and staples stocks. —With assistance from Michael Msika.

The ban will apply to all existing orders from the US manufacturing giant, while Beijing has also told the country’s carriers not to buy any aircraft-related equipment or parts from other American companies.Trump hit back against the Chinese intervention on social media, saying that Beijing had “reneged” on deals for what he called “fully committed to aircraft.” Boeing’s shares slumped as much as 4.5pc in premarket trading following the reports but later recovered most of these losses. The company declined to comment. It comes afterChina imposed 125pc tariffs on US-manufactured goods, which more than doubled the cost of Boeing planes and made it impractical for airlines to buy them, according to Bloomberg. It is the latest move in the tit-for-tat trade war between the US and China, which has seen Washington impose tariffs as high as 145pc on Chinese goods. Boeing has been caught in the middle of the clash, losing access to one of the world’s biggest aviation markets in the process. While Airbus has dominated Western airliner exports to China in recent years, the world’s second biggest economy remains a vital market for Boeing and had been forecast to make up 20pc of global demand over the next two decades.Airbus forecasts that China will have more than 11,000 aircraft in service by 2043, of which 9,500 will be new deliveries. It is also not the first time thatBoeing has been a source of tension between Washington and Beijing, as China was the first country to ground the 737 Max jet following two fatal crashes in 2019. It was also one of the last to allow the plane to re-enter service, which led some Chinese airlines to abandon orders. The standoff highlights China’s lingering dependence on imported planes despite its attempts to build up its own aerospace industry. The C919, a rival to the 737 developed bylocal plane-maker Comac, has won only a handful of export deals.Boeing has what it calls a completion and delivery centre in China but no actual production line there. That is in contrast to Airbus, which operates two final assembly lines for narrow-body jets in the city of Tianjin, 70 miles from Beijing. Currently, around 10 Boeing 737s are preparing to enter Chinese airline fleets, based on data from Aviation Flights Group, with some waiting at Boeing’s manufacturing base in Seattle and others at the firm’s completion and delivery centre in eastern China. Paperwork and payments for some of the jets may have been completed before China’s reciprocal tariffs took effect on April 12, Bloomberg reported, meaning they could still be delivered. The Chinese government is also considering ways to provide assistance to airlines that lease Boeing jets and are facing higher costs, it said.China’s top three airlines – Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines – had planned to take delivery of 45, 53 and 81 Boeing planes respectively between 2025 and 2027. Trump announced a Chinese order for 300 Boeing aircraft worth $37bn (£28bn) at a signing ceremony with President Xi Jinping during his first term in 2017, only for the bulk of the deal to be revealed to consist of earlier agreements, some dating back to 2013. China tends to order jets through a centralised buyer before dividing them up between carriers. Such accords are often tentative, leaving the final purchases particularly prone to changes or cancellation. They also mean that Boeing may have been counting on shipping hundreds more planes to China not yet officially recorded as orders on its books. Meanwhile, the broaderimpact of tariffs on the aerospace industryremains confused. Airlines in both the US and Europe have indicated that they intend to defer deliveries should Washington impose levies on planes, but Mr Trump has so far failed to make clear whether that will be the case. The boss of Delta Air Lines said last week that the carrier would not pay any tariffs that might become applicable on upcoming Airbus deliveries, and would instead delay taking the planes. Michael O’Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, one of the world’s biggest customers for Boeing planes, said he would also probably defer deliveries from the US company if they were to become more expensive. Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday called on his country and Vietnam to \"oppose unilateral bullying\", Beijing's state media reported, during a regional tour as leaders confront US tariffs.Xi told Lam their two countries must \"jointly oppose unilateral bullying, and uphold the stability of the global free trade system as well as industrial and supply chains,\" according to the Xinhua news agency. European Commission may reportedly let companies declare force majeure as part of strategy to rid bloc of Russian fossil fuels by 2027 UK retail bosses have warned that Trump’s tariffs will cause low-quality goods to be dumped into Europe from China via distributor sites like Amazon.

Energy watchdog cuts forecast for growth in demand by a third, and says a trade war could mean it falls further The tussle over British Steel has laid bare just how exposed UK industry is to foreign influence. China is seeking to position itself as a pillar of stability as US President Donald Trump continues to spook investors with tariff plans.View on euronews China has instructed its airlines to stop taking deliveries from Boeing, in the latest twist in the country’s fast-moving trade war with the US. Sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that officials had also requested Chinese carriers halt purchases of any aircraft-related equipment and parts from US companies. Donald Trump has imposed tariffs as Global sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles rose 29% year-on-year in March, helped by growth in China and Europe, while EV growth in North America was hampered by U.S. President Donald Trump's stance towards emissions standards and uncertainties around tariffs, data showed on Tuesday.  U.S. tariffs on car imports may force some of the country's automakers which produce in neighbouring Mexico to readjust prices, or move their production, Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester said.  Chinese counter-tariffs, meanwhile, could affect Tesla's U.S.-made models, leading to an almost doubling in prices of its Model S and Model X cars sold in China, Lester said. MILAN (Reuters) -Stellantis Chairman John Elkann said on Tuesday U.S. tariffs and strict European Union emissions standards were threatening the industry, as the automaker continued its search for a new chief executive.  \"With the current path of painful tariffs and overly rigid regulations, the American and European car industries are being put at risk,\" amid increased competition from China, Elkann said at the group's annual shareholders' meeting.  \"That would be a tragedy as car manufacturing is a source of jobs, innovation and strong communities,\" he said.

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you cansign upto receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings \"Every day is a march toward the next quarterly earnings report.\" That comment came to me compliments of a public company CEO a few weeks ago over coffee. It certainly jibes with what I've heard through the years from investor relations leads, CFOs, and CEOs. These keepers of the numbers have told me they are beholden to the market and its whims, and they spend insane amounts of time crafting earnings call narratives and plotting out guidance ranges. It all seems so silly, seeing as it's not required to issue guidance at all! And this brings me to today's thoughts. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo'sTermsandPrivacy Policy Now could be a good time for execs to use the cover ofTrump tariff uncertaintyto stop providing guidance of any kind, once and for all. After all, how can one believe any outstanding numbers in this environment (and environments three and a half years from now) when it could literally change with one Truth Social post? Delta (DAL) CEO Ed Bastiancaught a clue this week and yanked guidance. Levi's (LEVI) CEO Michelle Gass rolled the dice and let the company's outstanding full-year profit guidance ride. I found it bizarre, given Levi's stands to get hammered by tariffs due to its origin of sourcing. Shortly before Trump's 90-day tariff pause, one former apparel CEO told me by text the price of a pair of jeans could go up 50% to 100%. But the pause didn't include China, which now has a rate of 145%. But hey, at least Gass has formed aninternal \"task force\"to begin figuring out the tariff impact on the business. Walmart (WMT) CEODoug McMillonand CFOJohn David Raineymet investors in the middle. The companywarned on operating profits for the first quarterbut left its full-year range unchanged. \"I suspended guidance once in my six years and that was during COVID,\" former Hostess Brands CEOAndy Callahantold me. He added, \"CEOs/CFOs do a lot of work to understand the forecast and do sensitivities to those inputs to determine a RELIABLE RANGE of outcomes. When two things happen at once like is happening now ... ie a large range of uncertainty or short time to solve, they will suspend. The level of impact happening now is uncertain and likely outside range of CEOs to solve. They will likely suspend for at least a quarter. Guidance is not required and an uncertain or inaccurate guide is worse than a very rational suspension. And saying it does not include the impacts and keeping the guide is disingenuous.\" CEOs tell me a lot of companies are likely to remove guidance when earnings season begins next week. It feels like the right move, even if it hits the company's stock price. That means investors will have to assess companies differently — think more textbook-like than trying to predict an earnings number and subsequent stock reaction. I am curious, though: How much historically do you rely on sales and profit guidance from a company you own? And if you do rely heavily on that guidance, are you doing so now, given any outstanding forecasts are bordering on useless because of tariff uncertainty? I am eager to hear your thoughts — drop me a line on X@BrianSozzi. Full disclosure: I have for years disliked corporate guidance and have been steadfast in saying the practice should be stopped. Time to say bye-bye to analyst forecasts and whipsawing stock prices in the seconds after the earnings result hits the tape! I think a company's investment worthiness should be dictated by the pure health of the business, not by how an investment bankthinksa business should be doing based on their various spreadsheet inputs. The pure health of the business could be assessed by scrutinizing sequential sales, margins, profits, and cash flow growth rates on an absolute and relative basis (being simplistic here, but it can be done this way at the bare minimum). Nevertheless, here is what some top former public company CEOs told me about offering profit guidance during times of considerable economic and policy uncertainty, as is presently the case. Former Cisco CEO John Chambers \"General guidelines I follow in times of uncertainty are to err on the side of transparency and openness even if that requires a wider range in the guidance, with appropriate disclaimers, given the market conditions.\" Boston Consulting Group chair Rich Lesser \"We believe a pause in point estimates of forward guidance is justified for the most impacted industries with the widest outcomes. This should come with: Color on moving parts (e.g., tariffs, pricing, elasticity, supply chain moves, productivity & savings to ease pressure, ability to monetize/sell assets) to help investors and analysts model scenarios. A commitment to share as much as possible as soon as possible (ideally weeks not months). A commitment to get back to formal guidance in the short-to-medium term when the situation has clarified/stabilized a bit.\" Former Medtronic CEO Bill George \"We have discussed this question with CEOs recently. Given the uncertainty created by constantly changing tariffs and their unknown impact on the economy and on supply chains, I believe it is wise to withhold guidance on near-term revenues and earnings. This situation is similar to what CEOs experienced with COVID in 2020.\" Brian Sozziis Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on X@BrianSozzi,Instagram, andLinkedIn. Tips on stories?

The sharp increase in near-term expectations came as the projected level of inflation three years from now held steady at 3%, while the forecast for inflation in five years tipped down to 2.9% in March from 3% the prior month.

(Bloomberg) -- TikTok users in the US are being inundated with videos from Chinese influencers encouraging American buyers to overcome punitive Trump tariffs by buying direct from the “world’s factory” — China. Most Read from Bloomberg How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? The Secret Formula for Faster Trains Even Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem NYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six Lisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City’s Housing Shortage Mostly filmed at Chinese factories purporting to supply top US brands from Lululemon Athletica Inc. to Nike Inc., the influencers aim to “expose” how the vast majority of consumer goods are made in the world’s second-largest economy. Many of them provide website URLs and contact details for viewers to order directly from these suppliers. “Why don’t you just contact us and buy from us? You won’t believe the prices we give you,” said one creator selling luxury handbags. In another video, TikTok creator @LunaSourcingChina, stands outside a factory she says makes Lululemon yoga leggings for $5 to $6 even though they retail in the US for more than $100. “The material and craftsmanship are basically the same,” she says. A Lululemon spokesperson said the company manufactures about 3% of its finished goods in Mainland China and that authentic products are only available for purchase at Lululemon stores, official websites and authorized partners. Some of the most popular videos – many uploaded in March but only gaining traction in recent days – have been amplified by a video titled “China exposed the truth” with 8.3 million views and 492,000 likes, as of Monday morning, New York time. The one that reveals the Chinese supplier to Lululemon garnered 2.6 million views and over 215,000 likes, while a “How we bypass tariffs” clip had close to 1 million views and 118,000 likes. “This campaign appears to be a calculated attempt to undermine President Trump’s tariff policy on China by leveraging TikTok to promote Chinese manufacturing as cheaper, more desirable, and accessible—even in defiance of trade restrictions,” said Alex Goldenberg, senior advisor at the Network Contagion Research Institute at Rutgers University. While it’s unclear how ordering directly from Chinese suppliers would allow consumers to sidestep the tariff — the duty waiver for small parcels that are sent to American homes is also being scrapped from May 2 — the videos are aimed at undermining the White House narrative that the economic measures are in Americans’ interest. The levy on Chinese exports is now 145%, while Trump has paused additional tariffs on other countries for 90 days. The flood of posts also reflects the increased effectiveness of Chinese creators at reaching into the daily lives of ordinary Americans. TikTok’s algorithm, and its ability to influence what information millions of US users see, is one of the main driving forces behind US government efforts to force its Chinese owner ByteDance Ltd. to relinquish control of its international operations. TikTok didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Other Chinese social media apps like Xiaohongshu, or Red Note, have also gained popularity among young US users amid uncertainty around access to TikTok. “These posts are much more confrontational and mocking of the US, rather than showing it as a threat,” said Tom Harper, lecturer in Chinese international relations at the University of East London. They follow a wave of AI-generated images depicting Americans working on assembly lines, Harper added. Some of the videos directly criticize US trade policies and call on American citizens to take action. “For decades your government and oligarchs ship your jobs to China, not for diplomacy, not for peace, but to exploit cheap labor and in the process, they hollow out your middle class, crash your working class and told you to be proud while they sold your future for profit,” user @neil778027 said in a video. “Americans, you don’t need a tariff, you need a revolution.” On Friday, the US announced tariff exemptions on a range of Chinese products including electronics, computers and semiconductors, although it’s not known how long these exceptions will apply. Regardless, they will not affect most of the goods exported by China to the US, including the clothing and accessories produced by Chinese suppliers featured in the TikTok videos. Many European high-end luxury brands are also featured, but the makers of the videos don’t explain why they are featuring European brands in their pushback against the US. Another key question raised by the videos is whether the factories have non-disclosure agreements with their international clients and how the videos will potentially affect long-standing business relationships between brands and their manufacturers. Cameron Johnson, senior partner at Shanghai-based consultancy Tidalwave Solutions, who recently visited the Chinese trading hub of Yiwu, sees it as part of a fundamental shift in purchasing practices for China. “In the past, you might use a middleman or a trading company to source your products for your deal with quality control or go visit the factory, establish those relationships, and then maybe you would come on occasion,” he told Bloomberg TV. “But now what we’re seeing is just a complete democratization of sourcing products.” --With assistance from Annabelle Droulers, Daniela Wei, Zheping Huang and Omar El Chmouri.

The rapid rise of ultra-fast fashion retailer Shein has been so key to the fortunes of a group of urban villages on the outskirts of China's southern metropolis of Guangzhou that they have been colloquially dubbed \"Shein villages\".  Shein was able to become a behemoth selling over $30 billion worth of goods annually on a foundation of cheap prices and advantageous trade rules, such as the U.S. \"de minimis\" exemption that allows low-cost imports to enter the country duty-free.  But the supply chain efficiencies emanating from hundreds of humming factory floors in these villages, reacting in real-time to online orders for leopard print palazzo pants or peasant blouses at unbeatable prices, were also key to its success.

Nike (NYSE:NKE) recently announced an innovative collaboration with Kool-Aid, unveiling the vibrant Nike x Kool-Aid Ja 2 sneaker, which incorporates playful design elements inspired by NBA star Ja Morant's favorite flavors. Despite this launch, Nike's share price dipped 2.2% over the past week, a movement contrasting with the broader market’s 5.8% gain. This slight decline in Nike's price might not align with the broader market trend influenced by external factors, such as overall market optimism from major tech stocks rallying on tariff exemption news, which appeared to influence broader market sentiment more positively. Buy, Hold or Sell NIKE? View our complete analysis and fair value estimate and you decide. Find companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value. The recent collaboration between Nike and Kool-Aid, featuring the vibrant Nike x Kool-Aid Ja 2 sneaker, may add fresh appeal to Nike's product lineup. This partnership aligns with Nike's strategy to enhance brand storytelling and leverage sports performance dimensions as growth drivers. Although the share price fell 2.2% recently, this may be a short-term fluctuation possibly reflecting external market conditions rather than an immediate impact of the collaboration. Over a longer period of five years, Nike's total shareholder return, which includes share price and dividends, was a decline of 34.31%, underscoring challenges the company has faced in maintaining upward momentum. Compared to the past year, Nike's performance has lagged behind both the US Market and the broader Luxury industry, which are indicators of the competitive and economic pressures it encounters. Analysts predict a modest revenue growth of around 1.9% annually, alongside a slight increase in profit margins to 9.9% within three years. However, for Nike to meet the consensus price target of US$78.49, the stock would need to see a significant increase from its current trading price of US$53.27, indicating a trading discount of about 33.4% against the target. The Kool-Aid collaboration may help boost revenue and support these forecasts by enhancing brand engagement and driving full-price sales, aiding in net margin improvements and inventory turnover.

(Bloomberg) -- Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene sold US Treasuries and bought stakes in Amazon.com Inc., Blackstone Inc. and Tesla Inc. the day before President Donald Trump put a 90-day pause on retaliatory tariffs and prompted a market rally. Most Read from Bloomberg How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? Trump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space Even Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem LA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs $15 Million Fund Bets Leadership Training Can Improve Chicago Policing Greene, the Georgia Republican who’s a close ally of Trump, revealed the transactions in a financial disclosure last week. Greene’s trades were executed over two days, April 8 and 9. On the morning of the 9th, Trump posted on social media that it was a “great time to buy.” About four hours later, he announced he was suspending tariffs, propelling the S&P 500 index to a 9.5% gain, its biggest rally since 2008. Greene’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Greene, one of the first lawmakers to file a disclosure since Trump announced his tariffs, is an active trader in stocks, filing eight disclosures so far this year. She’s been particularly bullish on the semiconductor and tech industries. Her sale of Treasuries, though, was the first time she’s sold after buying more than $500,000 of the government-backed securities since the beginning of 2025. Congressional Democrats have urged investigations into whether people connected to Trump profited from the timing of the tariff announcements. In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she did not know which officials may have had advance knowledge, but called it “unconscionable” that insiders may have profited from the market volatility. The disclosure reports only require members to list values of transactions in broad ranges, and do not contain specific times of execution or cost basis, so it’s unclear precisely how many of Greene’s trades happened before Trump broke the news of the tariff pause. But at least $11,011 to $165,000 in purchases came on April 8. As of 11:20 a.m. Tuesday in New York, shares of Blackstone, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Tesla traded higher than at any point on that day. Over the two days, her stock purchases totaled $21,021 to $315,000. She sold $50,001 to $100,000 of US Treasuries on April 8. Among the other names in Greene’s purchases were chipmakers Nvidia Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., along with apparel companies Lululemon Athletica Inc. and Nike Inc.

Ross Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki says he doesn't like the way Elon Musk \"does things\" but still owns Tesla, expecting that \"something fixes itself at some point\". He joins Ed Ludlow on \"Bloomberg Technology\" to discuss. The move came after Tesla’s stock chart formed a so-called death cross on Monday.  For traders, a death cross is a sign that a stock is losing momentum.  Tesla stock, however, never does exactly what investors expect. Amazon.com has emailed its third-party sellers in recent days asking how tariffs are impacting their businesses, from sourcing to pricing strategies and international sales, according to a copy viewed by The Wall Street Journal.  “We’re still dealing with the repercussions of various tariff policies, and I believe it’s crucial for us that you share current experiences and strategies,” the email says.  Amazon also asked in the email about the merchants’ use of the company’s logistics services, which many sellers use to pack and ship their products. At one point last year, it fell about 65% from January to April after poor delivery numbers, only to soar more than 100% from its lows on the news of a partnership with Volkswagen.  Can Rivian take advantage of Musk's missteps?  Elon Musk's foray into politics and DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency) has clearly hurt Tesla and opened the door for electric vehicle (EV) rivals like Rivian. The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan will retain a co-control stake, continuing its partnership with the new investor group. Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) assets have changed considerably in recent years.  Today, the value of Berkshire's controlled companies exceeds its public equity portfolio.  Berkshire has reduced its stake in top holdings such as Apple and Bank of America. We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid Market Volatility.

China appointed a new trade negotiator Wednesday in the midst of its tariff fight with the U.S.  The government said Li Chenggang replaces Wang Shouwen, who participated in negotiations for the 2020 trade deal between the China and the U.S.  China faces 145% taxes on exports to the U.S., while dozens of other countries were given a 90-day reprieve for most duties.

We recently published a list of10 Best Golf Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against other best golf stocks to buy according to analysts. Golf stocks are publicly traded firms that are part of the golf industry. These companies include businesses that manufacture golf equipment, operate golf courses, and provide associated services, giving investors a chance to engage in the golf market. The golf industry continues to evolve with women, social play, lessons, and online bookings driving key developments. According to a report by NBC Sports Next, female engagement has grown by 15%, with 800,000 more women golfers joining between 2020 and 2022, compared to a 2% rise among male golfers. Women now account for one-third of junior players and 49% of surveyed golfers. Golf remains a strongly social activity, with 49% of surveyed golfers primarily playing with friends. Business-related golf is also growing, notably among GolfNow users. While 36% of golfers took a lesson in the previous year, the number rose to 67% among GolfNow customers, with many preferring a combination of on-course and facility-based training. Moreover, younger golfers are frequently booking online, with 43% of those aged 18 to 34 reserving at least one round by 2023. Speed and convenience are essential, with 55% citing online booking as the quickest option. These developments point out expansion prospects for courses that cater to women, social golfers, and digitally aware players. According to the National Golf Foundation’s research, the golf business in the United States is still expanding rapidly, with 45 million Americans (aged 6 and up) playing golf in 2023, including 26.6 million on-course and 18.4 million in off-course venues like simulators and Topgolf. The business has seen nearly 2 million new golfers each year for the past ten years, with 3.4 million first-time players projected in 2023 alone. The largest consumer age group is still young adults (18-34 years old), with 6.3 million participants on the course and 5.8 million off. Since 2019, juniors (3.5 million) have shot up by 40%, with girls accounting for 37%. Female involvement has climbed to 7 million, making up 26% of on-course golfers. In 2023, rounds played reached a record high of 531 million, beating the pre-pandemic average by more than 10%. The US offers 16,000 courses at 14,000 facilities, with 75% open to the public. Despite a 12% drop in course supply since 2006, demand remains high, with 22.4 million people expressing a desire to play. Finally, TGL, the golf league that began playing matches in January 2025, is combining digital and physical components to create an entirely new hybrid golf experience. Teams of golfers compete in a specially created venue across a set of custom-made holes. They begin by hitting a large-screen simulator of real terrain, then shift to a transformable turntable as the green. Broadcasting innovations aimed at bringing golfers’ experiences closer to home viewers were deemed crucial from the start. The 2025 PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando showcased the golf industry’s strong momentum. Marc Simon, Vice President of PGA Golf Exhibitions, stated: “The show is a reflection of the industry, and golf is thriving right now,” “With the surging popularity of golf, we saw the largest number of exhibitors and largest occupied space since 2009, which is encouraging to see.” The exhibition included over 1,000 exhibitors spread across 1.1 million square feet, showcasing golf’s continuous development in the $102 billion industry. More than 1,200 VIP buyers from 770 golf courses and mass merchandisers attended, totaling $810 million in purchasing power and roughly $2 billion in retail sales potential. The event has progressed beyond typical golf equipment and gear to include fitness, health, and wellness areas, as well as racquet sports and club facilities. The Clubhouse exhibition space was doubled in size, mirroring the trend in golf facilities toward broader member experiences. Technology was a major focus, with AI-powered golf simulators, effective ball-flight data, and next-generation golf carts catering to growing personal cart ownership. Golf’s trends are shifting, with a record 200 influencers in attendance and robust clothing growth fueled by Gen Z consumers. The PGA Show’s reinvention is in line with industry trends, stressing experiential marketing and innovation. Looking ahead, organizers intend to continue responding to changing company needs in order to ensure long-term industry success. A team of trainers and athletes displaying a wide range of athletic and casual footwear. For this list, we compiled an initial list of 12 golf stocks, which included companies that are involved in the golf industry. Then, we selected the 10 stocks that had the highest upside potential as of April 9, 2025. We have only included stocks in our list with an upside potential of 10% or higher. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the upside potential. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

However, other sports, such as basketball, jogging, and soccer, continue to receive wide attention.

The business aims to reconnect with players and sports fans by highlighting the brand’s genuine connection to the sport.

The new 24/7 apparel collection outperformed sales projections, showing successful footwear and apparel innovation. Hill admits that NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has relied too heavily on promotions to drive sales and intends to transition to a full-price model in its online business while actively eliminating outdated inventory through less profitable channels.

Key Points Tariffs are rattling markets and leading to spikes in volatility. Growth-focused sectors like technology andconsumer discretionaryare particularly vulnerable given their cyclicality and global exposure. Apple(AAPL-0.19%)andNike(NKE-1.03%)are down over 20% year to date at the time of this writing, significantly underperforming theS&P 500andNasdaq Composite, which are also down significantly. Here's why both stocks are selling off and whether they are worth buying now. Image source: Getty Images. There's no sugarcoating Apple's exposure to tariffs, especially in China. China is a key market for Apple -- both from a manufacturing and a sales perspective. After Apple stock surged on April 9 in response to a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs to all countries except China, it sank 4% the following day on news that the tariff rate on Chinese goods would be raised to astaggering 145%. If it sticks, that steep of a tariff rate would crush Apple's near-term profitability. That's why the stock is down so much year to date.  ^SPXdata byYCharts Buying Apple stock now is a belief that two things will happen: On April 10, reports indicated that Apple was flying iPhones from India to the U.S. to circumnavigate tariffs on China. If Apple feels China could be a longer-term risk, it could work to permanently shift manufacturing out of China toward India and other partners in Southeast Asia. However, investors may want to wait for Apple's upcoming earnings call on May 1 to better understand how the company plans to reduce the tariff impact. As for Apple's pricing power, iPhone growth has slowed in recent years. But the company has made up for some of that slowdown by growing its high-margin services segment and repurchasing stock to grow earnings per share. Entertainment services include Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, Apple Books, and more. Apple also has a growing list of financial services, from Apple Pay to Apple Card and Apple Cash. Apple has yet to make as big a splash in artificial intelligence as some investors may have hoped for, so there are fears that it lacks the pricing power it once had. However, services have enhanced the breadth of the Apple ecosystem. All told, Apple stands out as a solid buy if you believe in its ability to navigate supply chain challenges and its pricing power. But it's also reasonable to take a wait-and-see approach until investors get more clarity on Apple's response to tariffs from the earnings call in a few weeks. Nike's year-to-date losses are even more alarming, considering it was already one of the worst-performing components of theDow Jones Industrial Averagelast year. Nike has sold off so much that it is now hovering around its lowest level in a decade. The abridged version of Nike's problems is that it overly invested in switching the business away from wholesale partnerships to digital, which worked during the pandemic but proved a costly error in recent years, as thedirect-to-consumer segment has been underperforming wholesaleand Nike's brick-and-mortar stores. In addition to management blunders, Nike has been hit hard by formidable competition fromAdidasand newer players likeOn HoldingandDeckers Outdoor-owned Hoka. Tariffs throw yet another wrench in the Nike investment thesis at a time when the company was already licking its wounds from past mistakes. Reports indicate that Nike makes95% of its shoes in China, Vietnam, and Indonesia.China is a key market for Nike's sales as well. For the nine months ended Feb. 28, Greater China sales were $5.11 billion compared to $14.87 billion in North America and $9.26 billion in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. During that period, Nike sold more footwear, apparel, and equipment in Greater China than the rest of Asia Pacific and Latin America combined -- with Greater China making up a significant 15.1% of total Nike Brand revenue during that nine-month period. Like Apple, buying Nike stock now is a bet on the power of its brand, that it can turn the business around, handle competition, and pivot its supply chain. However, Nike is arguably more vulnerable than Apple, considering the business was already in the middle of aturnaroundbefore the onset of trade tensions. Nike has gone from a growth stock to a dividend-paying value stock. Despite its struggles, the company has continued to buy back stock and has23 consecutive years of dividend raises. The sell-off in the stock price has pushed Nike's yield up to a 10-year high of 2.8% and itsprice-to-earnings ratiodown to a 10-year low of just 18. Although if tariffs stick around, Nike's earnings will almost certainly fall in the near term -- making its valuation less appealing. Apple and Nike may operate in entirely different industries, but the buy case for both companies is similar. Both face serious tariff risks, and neither company has been growing earnings at breakneck rates in recent years. However, these are two top brands whose valuations could look cheap in hindsight if they can endure this challenging period. Apple stands out as the safer all-around play, whereas Nike has a higher risk and potential reward if it can turn the business around and navigate tariffs. Both stocks could be worth buying now if you have a long-term horizon. However, it's also reasonable to keep both stocks on a watch list and wait for upcoming earnings calls for more clarity on their strategies, given we are sailing through uncharted waters.

We recently published a list of10 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires. The market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump’s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year. The year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios. In the second month of 2025, the US government’s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States’ tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services. DW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods & services in the latest round of “Trump Tariffs”. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering “continuous stagflation”, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment. This scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children’s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children’s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President & CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing: “Make sure that money can be talked about, that there’s no taboos…so that your children are learning those really good financial literacy skills that they need to set themselves up for success for the rest of their life.” Investing in the markets for your children’s future has the advantage of time. In a report by MorningStar, investments in stocks have the added benefit of compounding return, which means the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to grow exponentially. CNBC reported on billionaire investor Mark Cuban and how he made billions from his first few million with a long-term view on his investments. To compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources and gathered the stocks they collectively favored. These stocks have a long-standing history of performance, with strong balance sheets and sound financials. Then, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database of billionaire stock holdings to arrive at our list of 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires as of Q4 2024. For the stocks with the same number of billionaire holdings, we have used the total value of billionaire holdings as a secondary metric to rank the stocks. Billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). A team of trainers and athletes displaying a wide range of athletic and casual footwear. No. of Billionaires: 14 Value of total Investment by Billionaires: $3.095 billion NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a global leader in the athletic goods industry. The company designs, develops, markets, and sells a wide range of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services worldwide under prominent brands such as NIKE, Jumpman, Converse, and Chuck Taylor. These brands are considered household names for both children & parents/ adults alike. In the Q3 2025 earnings report, NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) revenue was $11.27 billion, down 9.33% YoY, although beating analyst estimates by $231.5 million. EPS was $0.54, also beating estimates by $0.25. The company attributes the decline in sales to rising inflation, high tariffs but remains a market leader in high-quality athletic goods. It is among the best kid-friendly stocks to invest in. Recent declines in international markets such as the Middle East, Europe, and Asia (including China & Vietnam) were the result of reduced buying by price-conscious consumers. As per the United States International Trade Commission (USITC), China is the largest importer of shoes from the United States at 37%, while Vietnam is responsible for 29.8%. China was hit with the aforementioned 34% trade tariffs, while Vietnam was hit even harder with 46%. This is likely to further impact NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE)’s overall revenue figure. Experts consider these conditions as an optimal time to invest in the stock to take advantage of the lower price. Overall, NKEranks 6thon our list of best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of NKE, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Goldman Sachs JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley all said a surge in trading revenue helped lift their profits in the first quarter and beat expectations. Bank trading desks have been collecting more fees from investors scrambling to reduce or dial up the risk in their portfolios on any new clue about how President Trump’s tariffs might ultimately play out. Combined, the three banks earned more than $12 billion in fees in their equities businesses, the desks that run stock-market related activities for clients. Net revenues for Q1 2025 reached $15.06bn, up 6% from $14.21bn in the same quarter of the prior year. After reporting better-than-expected first quarter results, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) highlighted in its earnings call that the bank navigated the market volatility with record equity revenue and warned about “material risks” to the U.S. and global economies amid the ongoing trade war. What Happened: Goldman Sachs navigated a quarter of “rapidly shifting sentiment” to deliver robust first-quarter 2025 results, highlighted by a record $4.2 billion in equities net revenue, according to it Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) reported on Tuesday that the first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenue growth was 3% year-over-year and was $21.6 billion, beating the analyst consensus of $21.29 billion.

(Bloomberg) -- Worries over global trade dragged the dollar to a six-month low on Monday, leaving investors bracing for more weakness ahead. Most Read from Bloomberg How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? The Secret Formula for Faster Trains Even Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem NYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six Lisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City’s Housing Shortage The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index extended declines for a fifth day, falling a total of 3.3% during that stretch. While Treasuries and stocks rallied on news that President Donald Trump will delay levies on some popular consumer electronics, sentiment on the dollar was undermined by his warnings that the exemption will prove temporary. Protracted selloffs in the greenback and Treasuries — typically seen as havens in turbulent times — have exacerbated concerns that investors are lightening up on US assets in the face of tectonic trade policy shifts and broader political uncertainty. Listen to the Here’s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. Weakness in the dollar and Treasuries is a “horrible, toxic combination,” said Jordan Rochester, head of macro strategy for EMEA at Mizuho International Plc., in an interview on Bloomberg Television. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index finished Monday down 0.3%. The gauge has fallen about 6.1% so far this year, on track for its biggest annual loss since 2017. Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade. Sign up here. Positioning in the options market suggested traders were hedging against further declines. An index measuring three-month risk reversals — or the spread between call and put options — on the dollar against its major peers has dropped to a five-year low. That indicates greater demand for put options that would benefit from a weaker dollar than for call options that would gain from a stronger one. The S&P 500 index gained 0.8% on Monday. The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell 11 basis points to 4.38%. A five-day bond market selloff unleashed by anxiety over Trump’s trade war sent 10-year Treasury yields to the biggest weekly surge in over two decades last week. Lasting damage? The discussion that has dominated Wall Street for much of the past week has centered on whether Trump’s actions, even if they are eventually reversed, have inflicted lasting damage to the idea that the US dollar and Treasuries are the ultimate risk-free assets. “We are talking about a regime change in the way the market views the dollar, particularly during times of global financial stress,” Steve Barrow, a strategist at Standard Bank, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. “We’d note that the other key component of the US’s safe-asset allure – the Treasury market – has not been particularly safe.” That view was echoed by Derek Halpenny, head of global markets research at MUFG Bank, who focused on weekend remarks from Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stressing a longstanding plan to apply a different, specific levy to the technology sector. “It is difficult to see any fundamental factor that will likely improve investor sentiment,” Halpenny wrote in a report. “Key levels were broken last week for the dollar.” One-week risk reversals on the Bloomberg dollar index moved toward parity for the first time in five days, a sign that traders are becoming less bearish on the greenback. Still, the gauge has remained in negative territory for a third straight day, with bearish sentiment toward the US currency at levels unseen since the pandemic. “Trump’s actions have persistently damaged the ‘US brand’,” wrote Dana Malas, a strategist at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB. “This means that dollar assets, both inside and outside the US, should continue to carry higher risk premiums.” Almost 80% of respondents to a Bloomberg survey predicted the dollar would weaken further over the next month, the biggest proportion of bears since the surveys began in 2022. Strategists at the biggest Wall Street banks also see the potential for further weakness. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts suggested investors remain bearish the dollar, especially against the yen and euro, as there’s still a chance of a US recession. Mizuho Bank Ltd. anticipates the US currency may fall another 5% on a trade-weighted basis before rebounding, based on how it traded in 2017-18 and during the pandemic. “The design and implementation of these tariffs should have a negative impact on the currency because they have contributed to eroding consumer and business confidence,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Kamakshya Trivedi wrote. “If tariffs weigh on US firms’ profit margins and US consumers’ real incomes, like we think they will, they can erode that exceptionalism and, in turn, crack the central pillar of the strong dollar,” they said. --With assistance from Michael G.

The chaotic activity in the usually staid Treasury market has opened the door to some potential buying opportunities.  The Treasury market has been responding to mixed messages for weeks, even before President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement.  As Treasury yields rose, the dollar fell—both reversing the typical-safe haven moves those markets make when investors are worried. Another tariff climb down from the Trump administration sparked a relief rally in world stocks and bonds on Monday, but smoldering growth fears and deep-rooted doubts over the wisdom and execution of U.S. trade policy limited the euphoria.  Zoom out and the world continues to reassess its long-held faith in the dollar and U.S. Treasuries, the fates of which increasingly appear to be in the hands of foreign private sector investors. \"It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar's reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question,\" Capital Economics said. An eventful 24 hours in the crypto markets saw VTHO zooming 37%, Story’s IP falling and recovering 20%, with some traders hoping that the worst of the tariffs-driven selloffs are in the past. (Bloomberg) -- Investor sentiment regarding economic prospects is the most negative in three decades, yet fund managers’ pessimism isn’t fully reflected in their asset allocation which could mean more losses for US stocks, a Bank of America Corp. survey shows.Most Read from BloombergHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?Even Oslo Has an Air Quality ProblemNYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing SixLisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City’s Housing Shortage$15 Million F U.S. policy on stablecoins offers European citizens an attractive payment method for cross-border transactions which should trigger more concern than trade tariffs, Italy's economy minister said on Tuesday.

U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to overhaul rules on cryptocurrencies and reverse a crackdown on the sector that took place under his predecessor Joe Biden. Allegro had said in March that a sweetened $35.10 per share offer from Onsemi was \"inadequate\", just a few months after the smaller chip firm turned down a $34.50 a share proposal.  \"We have decided to withdraw our acquisition proposal given the reluctance of Allegro’s Board of Directors to fully engage and explore our proposal,\" Onsemi CEO Hassane El-Khoury said. U.S. stocks drifted Tuesday through a rare quiet day for financial markets.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 155 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite edged down by less than 0.1%.  The modest moves offered some respite following the huge swings that have battered Wall Street recently, not just day to day but also hour to hour. - European ETFs register trades worth $161.6 billion in just four sessions after 'liberation day.' - Daily trading volumes for European-listed ETFs averaged $5.7 billion during March. - BlackRock also registered record activity levels on consecutive days for its iShares operations in Europe. Argentina's grain industry welcomed an exchange-rate overhaul on Monday, though the new measures will likely not translate into immediate sales as the harvest remains behind schedule, experts said.  Late on Friday, Argentina's central bank loosened foreign-exchange controls, a long-awaited measure twinned with billions of dollars to be disbursed by development banks including the International Monetary Fund.  Lifting of the controls is also meant to speed up agricultural sales, a prime source of cash from abroad.

Key Points Despite recent stock market volatility,JPMorgan Chase(JPM-0.73%)shares are down just 1% year to date, outperforming the 9% decline in theS&P 500(^GSPC-0.17%)at the time of writing. The banking giant continues to benefit from its fortress-like balance sheet and global diversification, making it well-positioned to navigate any economic environment. That was the message from CEO Jamie Dimon presenting the bank's first-quarter earnings report (for the period ended March 31). JPMorgan topped Wall Street estimates, with revenue climbing 8% year over year, while earnings per share (EPS) of $5.07 was up 14% from the prior-year quarter. Yet the results arrived with a tone of caution. Jamie Dimon also said the U.S. economy faces \"considerable turbulence\" amid the looming impact of tradetariffsbeing implemented by the Trump administration. Let's discuss what tariffs and a trade war might mean for JPMorgan and its stock price outlook now. JPMorgan started the fiscal 2025 year off strongly, with all three of its business segments delivering revenue growth. The flagship Commercial & Investment Bank group saw excellent momentum, driven by optimism about the economic outlook at the beginning of the year and record market levels that propelled trading activity and deal-making. In the Consumer & Community Banking division, card services and auto lending have been growth drivers, reflecting resilient consumer spending. Asset & Wealth Management has also been a bright spot as continued net inflows boosted fee income. Some of the key financial metrics that stood out in the first quarter include a 2% year-over-year increase in average loans and deposits, while JPMorgan's book value per share rose 12% compared to Q1 2024, reaching $119.24.  Although it may have been business as usual for the bank in the first quarter, the outlook has grown increasingly uncertain. Officially, the bank is guiding for full-year net interest income of $94.5 billion, a 1% increase from last year. However, this number isn't etched in stone, since it depends on the rapidly changing macroeconomic environment. For now, the escalating trade tensions present an operational and financial headwind. In recent weeks, the Trump administration announced a major U.S. trade policy overhaul, implementing a 10% baseline tariff on most imports, with significantly steeper tariffs on specific countries like China. Although Trump has since rolled back some steps, pausing higher reciprocal tariffs for 90 days for most countries and allowing for some exceptions, experts warn that the measures may still cause economic disruptions. JPMorgan's chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli now estimates a 50% recession probability, indicating that the bank is taking the risks seriously. While it's too early to fully assess the effects of the tariffs, the widespread market confusion as companies across all sectors adjust to the new environment has several implications for JPMorgan's outlook. Image source: Getty Images. There are already indications that mergers and acquisitions have stalled, with dealmakers taking a wait-and-see approach. Companies are likely to reassess hiring plans or push back on major capital investments. For JPMorgan, this means a potential slowdown in its core investment banking business and commercial lending. If a recession does materialize, the consumer banking side of the business would be particularly hard-hit, as loan defaults rise, adding to credit losses. Even with some areas of the bank, such as trading, possibly benefiting from the market volatility across equities and fixed income to offset declines in fees elsewhere, the risk to earnings is tilted to the downside. All this is happening while shares of JPMorgan don't necessarily stand out as a great bargain. Across multiple metrics including the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.6 and price-to-book (P/B) value of 2.0, JPMorgan continues to trade at a premium relative to its average valuation multiples over the past five years. One interpretation is that if conditions deteriorate, the stock has room to fall further. JPM PE Ratiodata byYCharts. Amongbank stocks, few rival JPMorgan's strong fundamentals and disciplined capital management, offering shareholders a source of portfolio stability even in a severe economic downturn. A swift de-escalation of trade tensions through clearer policies or negotiations could catalyze a stock rebound. For now, I'm not convinced shares are a buy, and a cautious wait-and-see approach remains prudent.

(Bloomberg) -- Oil held steady as traders weighed the latest US moves in the global trade war, as well as the prospect of looser restrictions on Iranian crude. Most Read from Bloomberg How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? The Secret Formula for Faster Trains Even Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem NYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six Lisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City’s Housing Shortage West Texas Intermediate settled little changed near $61.50 a barrel, and Brent held below $65. While equities rallied after US President Donald Trump paused import duties on some electronics, fresh data revealing that American consumers see higher inflation in the year ahead weighed on oil futures. The US and Iran met on Saturday for nuclear talks that both sides described as constructive, raising the possibility of higher oil volumes from the OPEC member. Weekend talks in Oman marked the first top-level engagement since 2022 and signaled a renewed effort to resolve a years-long standoff over the country’s nuclear program. Both sides agreed to meet again. On the demand side, traders are grappling with a rapidly evolving outlook. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries slashed its projections for annual consumption growth by about 100,000 barrels a day, following a larger cut by the US Energy Information Administration. More banks also reduced their price forecasts, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. now seeing Brent at $66 this year. Crude has been dragged down in April as the trade war — especially the confrontation between the US and China — stokes fears of a global recession that would hurt energy demand. A surprise OPEC+ decision to bring back shuttered output more quickly than expected has added to the bearishness. “While the market has already priced in some future inventory builds, we expect large surpluses,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Daan Struyven said in a note, estimating a glut of 800,000 barrels a day this year. Brent is expected to average $63 over the rest of 2025, they said. Oil’s losses this month have formed part of an intense global market reaction to the evolving trade war, with most commodities and equities selling off. Investors pulling out of crude and fuel markets triggered a $2 billion net outflow in the week ending April 11, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Tracey Allen wrote in a note to clients. There have also been unusual declines in the US dollar and Treasuries, assets that typically function as havens during periods of stress.

Goldman Sachs  on Monday reported first-quarter profit that beat analyst expectations as tumultuous markets proved a double-edged sword.  The bank’s trading business boomed, benefiting from market swings, while revenue from investment bankers’ advisory work declined.  Goldman’s stock and bond traders took advantage of volatile markets, which can create opportunities for making big bets. Investment flows into Chinese physically backed gold exchange-traded funds so far this month have exceeded those for the whole of the first quarter and overtaken inflows registered by U.S.-listed funds, World Gold Council data showed.  Gold ETFs in China increased by 29.1 metric tons in the first eleven days of April, John Reade, senior market strategist at the WGC, said on social media on Monday.  \"If the first quarter of this year was dominated by the U.S. tariff-related gold flows and Western ETF buying, the second quarter may have a very different theme, that of a surge in investor interest in gold from China,\" he said. Goldman Sachs earnings beat Q1 views as global banking revenue offset declines elsewhere. The Dow giant was cautious on Q2. But GS stock rose. Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase last week both said they didn’t see indicators that companies were scrambling to do big draw-downs on credit lines to raise cash.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said he was considering a modification to the 25% tariffs imposed on foreign auto and auto parts imports from Mexico, Canada and other places.  That followed the move late on Friday to exempt smartphones, computers and some other electronics from Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs. WARSAW (Reuters) -Warner Bros Discovery has decided not to sell Polish broadcaster TVN, it said on Monday, drawing a line under speculation surrounding the future of the company, which is considered strategic by the Polish government.  The volatility unleashed by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies has led many investors to put deal-making activity on hold.  Warner Bros Discovery said in a statement sent to staff and seen by Reuters that it had reached its decision following a strategic review of its options for the Polish broadcaster.

(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street on Monday finally caught a respite from the deep selloffs and unusually sharp swings that have raced through markets ever since President Donald Trump unleashed his global trade war.

Even Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem NYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six Lisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City’s Housing Shortage $15 Million Fund Bets Leadership Training Can Improve Chicago Policing That was most evident in the Treasuries market. US government bonds rebounded from a five-day selloff that last week sent 10-year yields surging by the most in over two decades and fanned fears that an accelerating exodus from the securities would push the financial system toward a crisis. The relief — however fleeting it may turn out to be — was echoed in the equity market, where major indexes saw modest gains after Trump extended a temporary tariff exemption to imports of smartphones and other electronics and did nothing new to accelerate his conflict with China. “No news is good news in this environment,” said Adam Phillips, managing director of investments at EP Wealth Advisors. “We’re not saying the bottoms are in — we’re hopeful they are — but things can flare up at any time. One press conference or post on X could spark new headwinds,” he said. “We’re not in the clear yet.” The bond market’s recovery pulled down the benchmark 10-year Treasury rate by about 12 basis points on Monday as bonds advanced across the curve. The move extended on Tuesday in Asia, with the 10-year yield falling three basis points to 4.35%. Yields on Australia and New Zealand sovereign notes also dropped. The rebound in bonds eased concerns that built last week, when a steady rise in yields threatened to deal the US economy another hit by pushing up the cost of all kinds of loans. There was speculation it may worsen as Trump undermines confidence in US policy, with some speculating the Federal Reserve would potentially need to step in. But yields had risen so much — and so quickly — that by Monday some on Wall Street were seeing it as a chance to buy, especially since bonds will likely gain if the economy stalls and the Fed resumes cutting interest rates. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent moved to tamp down concerns about the market in an interview with Bloomberg Television, saying he has tools to steady it, such as buybacks, if needed. He also said there’s no evidence that overseas governments are selling their stockpiles of Treasuries. JPMorgan Asset Management’s Bob Michele, the global head of fixed income, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television that Treasuries may have hit bottom. Barclays Plc said five-year notes were attractive given the “downside risks.” “You do appreciate some of the stability in the market,” said Vishal Khanduja, head of broader fixed-income markets at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “These yield levels are compelling for a country that is going into a slower growth environment at best.” There remains little doubt that Trump’s shifting tariff policies are poised to exert a major drag on the economy by keeping businesses in wait-and-see mode and damping consumer confidence. Wall Street traders dazed by the rapid-fire reversals in the days since Trump’s tariff announcements said they have no confidence the volatility is over with. The VIX Index — known as Wall Street’s fear gauge — remains higher than it was on April 2, even though it has pulled back from recent peaks. A similar gauge for the Treasury market points to continued volatility. The 10-day realized volatility on the S&P 500 remains at the highest since the early days of the pandemic. By recent standards, though, the swings on Monday were far less jarring than last week, when the S&P 500 swung more than 10% in a single session. The S&P 500 ended the day up 0.8% after paring its gains late in the trading day. “What we’ve experienced over the last couple of weeks is it feels like the administration is trying to get its footing on its international trade policy in real time,” said Keith Buchanan, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. “We’re all trying to figure out what the heck is going on.” --With assistance from Michael Mackenzie, Isabelle Lee and Tian Chen.

(Reuters) -U.S. consumer spending has benefited from strong wage growth and low unemployment so far, but it faces huge risks if the upheaval sparked by President Donald Trump's trade policy persists, bank executives warned.  While the steep tariffs on the trading partners of the U.S.  have raised fears of price hikes, a low unemployment rate of 4.2% and a 3.8% annual wage growth in March are offering some relief.  \"The consumer continues to be resilient and discerning in their spend,\" Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told analysts.

Global sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles rose 29% year-on-year in March, helped by growth in China and Europe, while EV growth in North America was hampered by U.S. President Donald Trump's stance towards emissions standards and uncertainties around tariffs, data showed on Tuesday.  U.S. tariffs on car imports may force some of the country's automakers which produce in neighbouring Mexico to readjust prices, or move their production, Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester said.  Chinese counter-tariffs, meanwhile, could affect Tesla's U.S.-made models, leading to an almost doubling in prices of its Model S and Model X cars sold in China, Lester said. The filing in federal court in Texas by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and business groups that brought the case asked U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman in Fort Worth to enter a final order terminating the late fee rule.  Pittman had previously blocked the CFPB from implementing the rule, which was part of Democratic President Joe Biden's broader crackdown on \"junk fees,” though Trump’s Republican administration could have defended the rule on appeal. An unusual dynamic has led some to worry that U.S. investments are losing their appeal as a global safe haven.

Key Points One analyst believesJPMorgan Chase(JPM-0.73%)stock isn't the bargain it once was. He substantially lowered his price target on the \"Big Four\" U.S. bank last week, yet he remains bullish on its prospects. Here's a detail or several about his new take on the company, and whether his positive outlook is warranted. CFRA's Kenneth Leon published an update on JPMorgan Chase following thebank's unveiling of itsfirst-quarter resultsFriday morning. As in preceding quarters the lender did well, posting solid year-over-year growth on both the top and bottom lines, and topping the consensus analyst estimates for both. Yet like the rest of the world's businesses, JPMorgan Chase is currently sailing in unfamiliar waters. This was the crux of Leon's price target reduction, according to reports. The analyst wrote that he was narrowing his equity risk premium on the stock due to the currently high level of global uncertainty around U.S. trade policy. Nevertheless, Leon was very complimentary about the bank's trailing performance. In his view, all of JPMorgan Chase's businesses demonstrated robust health during the quarter, with its commercial and investment bank division especially benefiting from recent market volatility. With all this considered, Leon cut his price target to $260 per share, from his former $310. As that's nearly 12% higher than the company's most recent closing level; but he maintained his buy recommendation. It can be tough to stay bullish on a business so exposed to the whims of the global economy. JPMorgan Chase, though, has a very solid balance sheet and a management team that knows how to earn coin in even the most turbulent times. I think maintaining a bullish stance is the smart move with this stock, and I'd be a buyer at the current discount price.

CEO Jane Fraser said the firm has \"real horsepower and firepower in our investment capabilities.\" Citi plans to spend more in 2025 than it did last year on fixing long-running risk, data, and compliance deficiencies, as it carries out a yearslong turnaround plan that it refers to as its “transformation.”  Citi CFO Mark Mason said on a call with reporters that the firm is working to move away from manual activity and automate parts of its risk management processes and compliance programs.  Citi is prioritizing its efforts to try and change that. Citi and Bank of America posted first-quarter net interest income of $14 billion and $14.4 billion, respectively.  Wall Street expected $14.49 billion of NII for the quarter at BofA, according to data compiled by FactSet, and $13.56 billion at Citi.  BofA said in January that it expected to drive between $14.5 billion and $14.6 billion of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the first quarter.

We recently published a list ofJim Cramer Hints at a Bigger Agenda Behind Tariffs and Breaks Down These 7 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. In his latest appearance on CNBC’sSquawk on the Street, Jim Cramer suggested the recent tariffs might not simply be about economic leverage. He hinted at a deeper agenda within parts of the administration that goes beyond trade policy: “There’s plenty of sense that something’s going to happen that’s going to take this away. In fact, just because of what we saw the other day with it going to 10 percent, I don’t see that at all. I think these are very different kinds of tariffs. I mean, this is a tariff where I think there’s some people with the administration who actually ultimately have a goal of regime change.“ READ ALSO:Jim Cramer Reacts to the Surprise Market Surge and Highlights 8 Key StocksandJim Cramer Questions Market Logic and Dissects These 7 Key Stocks Discussing the likelihood of a negotiated settlement between Washington and Beijing, Cramer expressed deep skepticism that China would retreat under pressure. Instead, he described a Chinese leadership that had long prepared for confrontation: “When do the Chinese back down? Right now they’re not, but I don’t know. I think the Chinese have been ready for this since first Trump. I think that they are ready for tariffs. I think they’re going to build coalitions worldwide. I do not think they’re paper tigers. I think that they’re a strong country and they’re ready. They’re ready for the fight. And I’m afraid that we have many divisions that were behind enemy lines before this war started, including Apple.” To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on April 11th.

And when people here pulled forecast, you just sell the stock. Now is that right? I don’t think so.

Dimon had also offloaded some shares last year in his first such sale since taking over the top role in 2005. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender, last week surpassed its first-quarter profit estimates on record equities trading and higher fees from debt underwriting and advising on mergers. Dimon's 2024 pay package went up 8.3% to $39 million. The filing on Monday said Dimon sold 133,639 shares. The share sale comes as JPMorgan prepares for an eventual leadership transition. Dimon, 69, is one of the most influential figures on Wall Street and has run the bank for 19 years. The bank's board has said it is focused on the succession planning, which Dimon said last year is his most important task. Recently, Dimon also warned shareholders that trade wars could have lasting negative consequences including persistent inflation and high fiscal deficits.

(Bloomberg) -- Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene sold US Treasuries and bought stakes in Amazon.com Inc., Blackstone Inc. and Tesla Inc. the day before President Donald Trump put a 90-day pause on retaliatory tariffs and prompted a market rally. Most Read from Bloomberg How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? Trump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space Even Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem LA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs $15 Million Fund Bets Leadership Training Can Improve Chicago Policing Greene, the Georgia Republican who’s a close ally of Trump, revealed the transactions in a financial disclosure last week. Greene’s trades were executed over two days, April 8 and 9. On the morning of the 9th, Trump posted on social media that it was a “great time to buy.” About four hours later, he announced he was suspending tariffs, propelling the S&P 500 index to a 9.5% gain, its biggest rally since 2008. Greene’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Greene, one of the first lawmakers to file a disclosure since Trump announced his tariffs, is an active trader in stocks, filing eight disclosures so far this year. She’s been particularly bullish on the semiconductor and tech industries. Her sale of Treasuries, though, was the first time she’s sold after buying more than $500,000 of the government-backed securities since the beginning of 2025. Congressional Democrats have urged investigations into whether people connected to Trump profited from the timing of the tariff announcements. In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she did not know which officials may have had advance knowledge, but called it “unconscionable” that insiders may have profited from the market volatility. The disclosure reports only require members to list values of transactions in broad ranges, and do not contain specific times of execution or cost basis, so it’s unclear precisely how many of Greene’s trades happened before Trump broke the news of the tariff pause. But at least $11,011 to $165,000 in purchases came on April 8. As of 11:20 a.m. Tuesday in New York, shares of Blackstone, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Tesla traded higher than at any point on that day. Over the two days, her stock purchases totaled $21,021 to $315,000. She sold $50,001 to $100,000 of US Treasuries on April 8. Among the other names in Greene’s purchases were chipmakers Nvidia Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., along with apparel companies Lululemon Athletica Inc. and Nike Inc.

Amazon.com has emailed its third-party sellers in recent days asking how tariffs are impacting their businesses, from sourcing to pricing strategies and international sales, according to a copy viewed by The Wall Street Journal.  “We’re still dealing with the repercussions of various tariff policies, and I believe it’s crucial for us that you share current experiences and strategies,” the email says.  Amazon also asked in the email about the merchants’ use of the company’s logistics services, which many sellers use to pack and ship their products.

JPMorgan Chase & Co.(JPM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +0.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which JPMorgan Chase & Co. falls in, has lost 4.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is expected to post earnings of $4.44 per share, indicating a change of +0.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.3% over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.06 points to a change of -8.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.31 indicates a change of +6.9% from what JPMorgan Chase & Co. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For JPMorgan Chase & Co. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $42.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -14.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $173.59 billion and $178.19 billion estimates indicate -2.2% and +2.7% changes, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported revenues of $45.31 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.1%. EPS of $5.07 for the same period compares with $4.63 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $43.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.82%. The EPS surprise was +9.74%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about JPMorgan Chase & Co. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) reported first quarter increases in profits and revenue driven by robust trading results, becoming the latest big banks to benefit from the market volatility triggered by the start of President Trump’s tariff rollout in February and March. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan acknowledged in a statement Tuesday that \"we potentially face a changing economy in the future\" — a nod to the uncertainties ahead as some of Trump's more aggressive tariffs are still in question — but he also told analysts the bank's research team doesn't see a recession happening in 2025. US consumers, according to the bank's data, keep \"pushing money into the economy\" and the lender's business clients \"remain profitable, liquid and have strong results.\" \"We continue to watch for signs the environment [is] actually changing,\" Moynihan added. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser also nodded to Trump's trade war in her Tuesday earnings statement, noting that \"when all is said and done, and longstanding trade imbalances and other structural shifts are behind us, the U.S. will still be the world’s leading economy, and the dollar will remain the reserve currency.\" At Bank of America, total sales and trading revenue for the country's second-largest bank rose 9% from the year-ago period to $5.66 billion, its highest quarterly haul in more than a decade. Bank of America's revenue just from trading equities was up 17% to $2.2 billion, its highest ever for one quarter. Citigroup's sales and trading revenue rose 12% from the year-ago period to $6 billion, with Citi also notching its highest quarter ever for equity trading. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) also reported jumps in trading amid market volatility during the first quarter. Together, the big five banks on Wall Street pulled in nearly $37 billion on that front. At the same time, some banks showed a slight pullback in investment banking, as companies became more cautious about new deals amid the uncertainties surrounding Trump’s trade policies. Those fees at Bank of America fell 3% from the year-ago period to $1.52 billion.

Its total profits and revenue also rose from a year ago to $4 billion and $21.6 billion, exceeding analyst expectations. Total profits for Bank of America were $7.4 billion. That figure was 11% higher than a year ago and exceeded what analysts expected. The stocks of Bank of America and Citigroup both rose in Tuesday morning trading. Bank of America CFO Alastair Borthwick told reporters, \"Our research team at this point doesn't believe we'll see a recession, and our clients continue to show encouraging signs.\" \"Our research team are still calling for modest growth,\" he added. \"They've talked about the fact that they think that some of the uncertainty may lead to a slowdown in the economy before it picks back up, but that would be very similar to things like the blue-chip consensus at this point, and similar to what Chairman Powell has said\" — referring to Fed Chair Jerome Powell. But there were signs that Bank of America expects credit conditions to worsen. It set aside $1.48 billion in credit provisions for potential future losses, more than 12% more than it set aside a year ago. Borthwick walked analysts through a comparison of the bank's balance sheet now as compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, a tumultuous period following a housing crash andfinancial crisisthat severely tested Bank of America and the rest of the US banking system. He told analysts that Bank of America's capital base and liquidity have increased significantly since the end of 2009, and stress test results indicate significantly lower credit losses expected in a severe downturn. The changes made since that time, Moynihan said, allow the bank to \"stand tall in times of stress.\" Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance Big Tech stocks are too important to be sacrificed in a trade war but a negotiated peace isn't yet on the table.

We recently published a list ofGoldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in. As we recentlydiscussedin another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities. So, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last. Warren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’sBerkshirepicks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities. Overall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio. So, let’s take a look at the top Goldman Sachs value stocks. A group of business people discussing plans around a boardroom table adorned with a financial services company logo.

(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. sold a combined $14 billion of US investment-grade bonds Tuesday, matching the day-earlier total from peers Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Most Read from Bloomberg How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? Trump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space LA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs $15 Million Fund Bets Leadership Training Can Improve Chicago Policing Wells Fargo is issuing $8 billion of bonds in four parts, while Goldman sold $6 billion in three parts, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The market’s third borrower Tuesday, Japanese financial firm Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., priced $3 billion of notes. The longest portion of Wells’ offering, an 11-year security, yields 1.28 percentage point above Treasuries, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified as the details are private. Goldman’s longest portion, a six-year tranche, yields 1.25 percentage point above Treasuries, a separate person said. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Lead $16.5 Billion Bank Borrowing Spree It’s common for the biggest US banks to sell debt shortly after releasing quarterly results. But there were some questions this go-around after the primary market froze earlier this month in the wake of an evolving global trade war. Tuesday’s deals received orders 3.3 times the amount of bonds sold, according to Bloomberg’s Brian Smith, compared with 3.8 times on Monday. “Clearly there’s appetite for sizable bank issuances,” said Peter Simon, an analyst who covers the sector at research firm CreditSights. “We don’t see much evidence that the market is overly concerned with these banks, which makes sense given their results have been solid this quarter.” Goldman reported record revenue in the first quarter, while Wells Fargo’s report pointed to soft loan demand amid the ongoing tariff uncertainty. Wells’ net interest income, the difference between what it makes from lending and pays for deposits, fell short of analysts’ projections. Still, non-interest expenses were better than forecast as Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf works to cut costs. In the high-grade market, banks have underperformed in recent weeks, with TD Securities credit strategist Hans Mikkelsen writing that was likely due to expectations of new debt sales. The average bank bond spread widened 24 basis points this month through Monday, more than investment-grade notes overall while yields for the latter briefly hit 11-month highs last week. That has lured yield buyers into the market, setting things up well to digest the banks’ debt sales, said Samuel Wilson, a portfolio manager at Voya Investment Management. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. are candidates to issue debt after they released first-quarter results Tuesday.
