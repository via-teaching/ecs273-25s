People just kept on engaging with more and more stuff that wasn’t what their friends were doing.”The trial is high-stakes for Mr Zuckerberg, whosenet worth of $192bnis tied to Meta. If the FTC wins, Meta could be forced to sell off both Instagram and WhatsApp.Meta has said the lawsuit “ignores reality” by claiming that the company’s only competitors are Snapchat and an app called MeWe, adding that it is confident of winning.Jennifer Newstead, Meta’s chief legal officer, wrote in a blog post ahead of the trial: “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps).“More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final.”Ms Newstead added: “It’s absurd that the FTC is trying to break up a great American company at the same time the administration is trying to save Chinese-owned TikTok.“And, it makes no sense for regulators to try and weaken US companies right at the moment we most need them to invest in winning the competition with China for leadership in AI.”The start of the trial came despite predictions that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the US government let up on the enforcement of competition law against tech giants.The FTC filed its case during Donald Trump’s first administration in 2020. However, the trial has taken on a new political hue following the US President’s return to the White House.Mr Zuckerberg donated $1m to Mr Trump, who he described as “badass” following last year’s assassination attempt, and was given a prime seat at his inauguration.That came just weeks after Meta announced it was scrapping third-party fact checking in a move widely interpreted as an effort to align the tech company with the President’s politics.The rapprochement will spark speculation that Mr Zuckerberg could seek support from the President in Meta’s legal battle against the FTC.However, any such attempt would be complicated by US District Judge James Boasberg, who is presiding over the case. Judge Boasberg last week threatened to hold Trump administration officials in contempt of court over their rushed efforts todeport hundreds of people to El Salvador.In a court filing, Meta has argued that the FTC “must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past”.This, analysts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media market in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram.The case is expected to last two months, with Mr Zuckerberg likely to give days of evidence.The trial could mark a ‘new social media world order,’ tech expert saysInvesting.com -- Cathie Wood, the founder, CEO, and CIO of ARK Invest, has weighed in on President Trump’s tariff policy, which has been a cause for concern among many observers. Wood, however, sees potential benefits from the policy that may not be immediately apparent.Investing.com -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to start analyzing data on users’ devices to enhance its artificial intelligence (AI) platform. The move aims to protect user information while helping Apple keep pace with AI competitors. Apple’s traditional training of AI models uses synthetic data, which is designed to replicate real-world inputs without any personal details. However, this synthetic information isn’t always reflective of actual user data, which can hinder the effectiveness of itRachel Reeves should consider raising the basic rate of income tax for the first time in 50 years, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said.Twelve years ago, an empty homes tax was introduced across England in an attempt to bring “ghost homes” back to life.The Great War of China.

Trump on Sunday said he would be announcing the tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, indicating that the exemptions for smartphones and computers from his tariffs on China likely will be short-lived.
