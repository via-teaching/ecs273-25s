picture alliance / Contributor / Getty ImagesMeta (META) went to court Monday against the Federal Trade Commission in a landmarkantitrustcase that could force the social media titan to sell offInstagram or WhatsApp.The FTC’s complaint, originally filed in 2021, alleges Meta engaged in an “illegal buy-or-bury scheme to maintain its dominance” and “acquired innovative competitors with popular mobile features that succeeded where Facebook’s own offerings fell flat or fell apart.”1If the trial ends in the FTC’s favor, Meta could be forced to break up its social media holdings by selling off apps such as Instagram or the social messaging platform WhatsApp.The trial comes a couple weeks after Zuckerberg reportedly visited the White House to seek President Donald Trump's help to resolve the FTC case, according to reporting from theNew York Times.2The Meta CEO has also looked to the administration for help in fightingagainst looming finesfrom the European Commission, according to reports.In a statement over the weekend, Meta Chief Legal Officer Jennifer Newstead said, "it’s absurd that the FTC is trying to break up a great American company at the same time the Administration is trying to saveChinese-owned TikTok."3Shares of Meta slid about 2% in recent trading Monday.
