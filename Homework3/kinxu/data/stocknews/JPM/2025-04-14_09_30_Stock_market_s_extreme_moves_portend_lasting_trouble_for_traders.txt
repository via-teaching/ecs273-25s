Ironically, that could be a harbinger of tough times for equity investors.Most Read from BloombergThe Secret Formula for Faster TrainsNYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing SixEven Oslo Has an Air Quality ProblemInside the Quiet, Extravagant Expansion of the Frick CollectionLisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City’s Housing ShortageThe S&P 500 Index’s best days in history have usually preceded weaker-than-average returns in the near term. Following its 15 largest daily gains, the US stock benchmark was higher six months later just 43% of the time, Bloomberg Intelligence data going back to 1928 show. That’s lower than the 67% probability on any given day that the S&P 500 (^GSPC) will advance over the subsequent half year.These “head fakes” happen frequently in market downturns, said Dave Mazza, chief executive officer at Roundhill Investments.Indeed, such moves were only seen during past economic crises. Of the S&P’s best 15 days, two occurred during the pandemic in 2020, two in the 2008 global financial crisis, one amid the Black Monday rout of 1987 and nine across the Great Depression between 1929 and 1933.The 9.5% advance in stocks on April 9 tied for the eighth-best day ever for the S&P 500, according to an analysis led by BI strategists Gina Martin Adams and Michael Casper. It came after Trump said he would hold off on some of the harshest reciprocal tariffs, hurling shares toward their largest upswing in 17 years. That jump helped US equities notch their best week since late 2023.The biggest Wall Street firms have highlighted how difficult it has been to predict the trajectory for equities. Barclay’s Plc’s Venu Krishna said the dramatic volatility leaves little confidence in any pricing now, while JPMorgan Chase & Co.s (JPM) Dubravko Lakos-Bujas indicated that forecasting in the current environment is a challenge and leaves a wide range of outcomes, all contingent on trade policy.The next big hurdle for investors is first-quarter earnings, which kicked off Friday with big banks including JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley (MS). Analysts are warning that companies are flying blind through the trade war turbulence, forcing them to withdraw their outlooks and causing further market swings.Wall Street has been quick to dismiss last week’s record-breaking session, noting that the jump was the result of hedge funds forced to rapidly close out bearish positions, and algorithmic trading strategies picking up on tariff headlines.It was “the mother of all short squeezes,” said Frank Monkam, head of macro trading at Buffalo Bayou Commodities.The rally was not driven by a positive shift in sentiment from investors, said Stuart Kaiser, head of equity trading strategy at Citigroup Inc. (C)“The risk that tariffs stay in place and China retaliating again make it hard to chase a rally, so there is a bit of a buyers’ strike unless or until we get to levels where those risks are more fully priced,” he added.Bank of America Corp.’s (BAC) Michael Hartnett urged investors Friday to sell any rallies in the S&P 500 until the Federal Reserve steps in — something policymakers so far have said they’re not ready to do — and the US and China de-escalate the global trade war. On Friday, Beijing hiked tariffs on all US goods to 125%, mirroring a move by the White House that pushed levies on Chinese imports to the same level, on top of an existing 20% tax.“The reality of the matter is, a 90-day postponement of the tariff deadline ushers in another three months of dark macro clouds for markets,” said Monkam.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Beauty Salon Recession IndicatorTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on PurposeWorld Travelers Are Rethinking Vacation Plans to the USHow One MBA Grad Blew the Whistle on a $2 Billion DealCheap Consumer Goods Are the American Dream, Actually©2025 Bloomberg L.P.By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo'sTermsandPrivacy PolicySony said it will raise prices starting Monday for some PlayStation 5 video game consoles in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, citing global economic turmoil.

That in turn can generate market volatility which can threaten financial stability, it said in a chapter from its forthcoming Global Financial Stability Report.  The IMF did not mention specific events, such as the sweeping tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump has announced in recent weeks.(Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. slashed their estimates for 2025 earnings as companies kick off their first-quarter reports, joining a wave of Wall Street banks warning that tariffs will curb profit growth.

India is resisting U.S. pressure to lower tariffs on staples like rice and wheat, while signalling its willingness to cut tariffs on other farm goods such as almonds, cranberries, quinoa, oatmeal, pistachio, and walnuts.  Still, corn and soybeans are expected to feature in the negotiations, with the United States eager to sell these two agricultural products to India.(Bloomberg) -- While US President Donald Trump has announced a 90-day pause on his proposed tariff hikes, exporters are still dealing with the uncertainty of a 10% universal levy returning if trade deals aren’t struck as his administration envisages.Most Read from BloombergThe Secret Formula for Faster TrainsNYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing SixEven Oslo Has an Air Quality ProblemHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?Lisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City’s HouWhen a group of Harvard Business School students visited Italy's Monte dei Paschi di Siena in January, they gathered notes to build a case study on how to turn around a bank.

Advisory group Institutional Shareholder Services has urged shareholders to reject the plan as it leaves "little margin for error", while rival Glass Lewis is in favour, saying Lovaglio's track record provides guarantees for shareholders.JP Morgan and Houlihan Lokey have been identified as the leading financial advisers in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) for the first quarter of 2025, according to the latest financial advisers league table published by GlobalData.
