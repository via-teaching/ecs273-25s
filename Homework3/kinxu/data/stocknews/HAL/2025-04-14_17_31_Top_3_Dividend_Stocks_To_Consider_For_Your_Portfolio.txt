Does National Fuel Gas (NFG) have what it takes? Let's find out.MPTI, PBI and STRL made it to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) growth stocks list on April 14, 2025.Although the market rebounded sharply on Wednesday on news that President Trump was pausing tariffs and only levying a flat 10% rate, except for China, the Nasdaq is still in a bear market.  Bear markets start when an index drops 20% from its all-time high and technically remain in bear market status until a new all-time high is reached, which then kicks off a bull market.  Regardless of the technical definition of a bear market, there are still plenty of bargains to be scooped up right now, and I think investors should still be buying.Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks.

If the increased costs are eaten by Apple, on the other hand, its profitability will definitely take a hit.How much does the radio host expect you to invest each year?Retiring on a fixed income can seem daunting, but with some planning and commitment to a frugal lifestyle, it's possible to retire comfortably on $2,000 a month.
