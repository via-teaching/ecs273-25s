Speaking to reporters in Washington, D.C., Huang said American innovation in AI should be shared more broadly and that current policies may be out of step with global realities.
We need to accelerate the diffusion of American AI technology around the world, Huang said, calling for stronger backing from the Biden administration to expand global reach.
The comments come as U.S. officials weigh updates to the so-called AI Diffusion Rule, which was implemented in January. The regulation aims to control the overseas flow of cutting-edge AI hardware, such as accelerators, citing national security concerns.
A proposed revision from the Trump campaign would reportedly categorize countries into tiers and restrict the number of advanced chips each can receive.
Huang also warned that China, and in particular Huawei Technologies, is catching up rapidly in AI capabilities, a development he suggested could challenge U.S. leadership in the sector.
The remarks follow growing industry opposition to the rule, with several companies and lobbying groups pressing for more flexible terms.
Shares of NVDA are up 4% on Thursday morning.
