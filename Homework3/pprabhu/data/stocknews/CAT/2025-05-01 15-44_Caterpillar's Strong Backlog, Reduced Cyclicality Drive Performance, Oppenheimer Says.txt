Caterpillar's (CAT) "better than feared" performance is driven by strong and diverse backlog growth
Caterpillar (CAT) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of -1.16% and 2.01%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 2025. Do the numbers hold clues to what lies ahead for the stock?
Caterpillar estimates the Trump administration's tariffs will add $250 million to $350 million in additional costs this quarter.

Here’s a sector-by-sector breakdown of how major players are reacting to the mounting pressure of tariffs and retaliatory trade measures. The post 20 company reactions — good and bad — to Trump’s tariff war appeared first on FreightWaves.
Caterpillar said Wednesday it anticipates that tariffs may increase its second-quarter costs by up to $350 million as its first-quarter sales slipped on declining demand for its equipment.  On Tuesday Trump signed an order relaxing some U.S. tariffs on imports of autos and auto parts.  In the first quarter, Caterpillar's revenue dropped to $14.25 billion from $15.8 billion a year earlier.

Former Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren says a US recession is likely this summer unless the Trump administration pulls back on its tariff policy. He expects the Federal Reserve to move slowly until it's apparent "what the inflation and employment shocks are." He speaks on "Bloomberg Surveillance."
