Warren Buffett, one of the most renowned names in the world of finance, was inspired by two famous economists from the 1930s, Ben Graham and Philip Fisher. From Graham, Buffett learned the idea of a margin of safety, which means he seeks companies whose stocks are trading for less than what their assets are actually worth. He also picked up Graham’s belief that it is pointless to obsess over daily market ups and downs, since real success comes from holding investments for the long term. From Fisher, Buffett developed a strong focus on the quality of a company’s management. He realized that great leadership can make a significant difference in a business’s long-term value. Fisher also warned that over-diversifying could backfire, making it harder to properly monitor each investment. Buffett clearly follows this thinking, since his $267 billion portfolio is concentrated in just 38 stocks as of Q4 2024.
Warren Buffett’s investment strategy is a masterclass in disciplined and fundamentals-driven investing. His focus is on companies with durable competitive advantages, which he refers to as economic moats, combined with strong management and solid capital allocation. The Oracle of Omaha is against chasing trends. Instead, he looks for long-term value and buys only when a company is trading below its intrinsic worth. Buffett’s approach with the iPhone-maker is a great case in point. He was not just impressed by the hardware; he saw the value in its services ecosystem, like the App Store and iCloud, which generate consistent, high-margin revenue.
During the height of the 2008 financial crisis, the Berkshire billionaire shared a remark with investors that remains just as relevant in the current stock market landscape. He wrote:
“Over the long term, the stock market news will be good. In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.”
Buffett also emphasizes simplicity and efficiency. Despite his success as a stock picker, he recommends low-cost S&P index funds for most investors, believing they outperform most professionals over time. At its core, Buffett’s strategy is not flashy, and he offers a blueprint for sustainable wealth creation. This article presents the Warren Buffett stock picks that are especially suitable for new investors looking to build a strong portfolio.

Adjusted earnings fell to $3.6 billion from $6.5 billion, mainly because of weaker margins and lower oil prices. Still, Chevron hit record oil production both globally and in the US, driven by strong growth in the Permian Basin. The company ended the year with about 9.8 billion barrels in reserves. Chevron also returned a record $27 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks and announced a 5% dividend increase heading into 2025.
According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 81 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management was a prominent stakeholder of the company, with nearly 20 million shares valued at $2.8 billion.
