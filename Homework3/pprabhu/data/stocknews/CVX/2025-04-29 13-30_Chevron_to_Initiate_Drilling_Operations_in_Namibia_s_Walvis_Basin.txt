Chevron Corporation CVX, the U.S. oil and gas major, has stated that it plans to drill an exploration well in the Walvis Basin offshore Namibia. Namibia has recently gained significant attention from major oil-producing firms worldwide owing to promising discoveries in the region (like the Orange Basin), and it is anticipated to emerge as the next hotspot for exploration and production activities.
Chevron’s subsidiary, Chevron Namibia Exploration Limited,expects to begin drilling activities offshore Namibia in 2026 or 2027. The drilling activities will be conducted within the Petroleum Exploration License (PEL) 82, in the Walvis Basin. The Walvis Basin lies to the north of the prolific Orange Basin, where several international energy players like TotalEnergies, Galp Energia and Shell have made successful oil discoveries.
In February 2025, Chevron acquired an 80% stake in PEL 82 from Custos Energy. The company has assumed the operatorship of the exploration license. Custos Energy retained a 10% stake in PEL 82, and the remaining 10% is owned by the National Petroleum Company of Namibia (“NAMCOR”). The Walvis Basin was described as the most promising opportunity within PEL 82, per Custos Energy.
This move expands CVX’s global exploration portfolio and marks a step closer to entering Namibia’s promising oil and gas sector. However, CVX mentioned in January that its first well in the Orange Basin did not yield promising results, and the hydrocarbon reserves found were not suitable for commercial exploitation.
Namibia has attracted the attention of global oil companies owing to its significant untapped potential and promising offshore hydrocarbon finds. Many large energy players that previously focused on established oil-producing regions in Africa, like Nigeria and Angola, are now shifting their exploration efforts toward Namibia.
CVX currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
