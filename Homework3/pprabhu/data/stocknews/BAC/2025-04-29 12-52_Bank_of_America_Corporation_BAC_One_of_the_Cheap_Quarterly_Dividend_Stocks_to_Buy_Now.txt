We recently published a list of the 10 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stands against other overlooked dividend stocks.
In the current market environment, investors are looking to seek stable income as a way to protect themselves against a possible recession. Business surveys from ISM and S&P Global have highlighted increasing concerns among companies about the impact of new tariffs, with the S&P Global survey projecting an annual GDP growth rate of only around 1% for the first quarter. While most forecasts predict growth of 0.5%, some nowcasting models indicate the possibility of a contraction. Markets are particularly focused on how the US administration will address the growing recession risks, especially regarding its approach to tariffs and trade agreements.
In addition, despite President Donald Trump’s decision to pause a significant tariff increase on multiple countries, Americans continue to fear a recession and rising inflation. Consumer sentiment dropped 8% in April compared to the previous month, reaching a final reading of 52.2, according to the University of Michigan’s latest survey. This level of sentiment marked the fourth-lowest in records dating back to 1952. Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, made the following comment in the release:
“While this month’s deterioration was particularly strong for middle-income families, expectations worsened for vast swaths of the population across age, education, income, and political affiliation. Consumers perceived risks to multiple aspects of the economy, in large part due to ongoing uncertainty around trade policy and the potential for a resurgence of inflation looming ahead.”
Analysts suggest that investors worried about an economic slowdown might want to consider investing in dividend-stock funds, as these stocks have historically performed relatively well during recessions. Companies that pay dividends usually generate enough excess cash flow to sustain payments year after year. Dividend programs are often seen as a sign of strong financial discipline, as companies committed to paying dividends are generally hesitant to alter their policies. According to a Morningstar report, dividend-paying stocks outperformed the broader market during the recessions that began in July 1981, March 2001, and December 2007, with the stocks doing significantly better in two of those periods. However, they slightly underperformed during the short recession of 1980, which followed the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes to control the high inflation of the 1970s.
Within dividend investing, dividend growth stocks have outperformed those with high yields. A Morningstar report noted that dividend growth funds provided the most appealing long-term returns, as seen in the data presented. These funds not only offered the highest total returns but also achieved the best balance of risk and return, as measured by the Sharpe ratio. The report also pointed out that dividend growth strategies have generally performed the best during recessions. Except for 2001, when their greater exposure to technology stocks became a disadvantage, dividend-growth funds performed better than other dividend categories during recent recessionary periods.
