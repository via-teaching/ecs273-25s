(Reuters) -UnitedHealth Group said on Tuesday insider Patrick Conway will take on the top job at Optum, its health services segment, replacing Heather Cianfrocco, who will take on a new role within the healthcare conglomerate.
Conway is currently the chief executive officer of Optum Rx, the company's pharmacy benefit management unit. Conway joined Optum in February 2020 and has held senior leadership roles at Optum Rx and Optum Health.
The Optum health services arm offers a range of healthcare solutions, from pharmacy benefit management to financial consultation and mental health support.
Cianfrocco has been appointed as the executive vice president of governance, compliance, and information security at Optum.
Both the new appointments are effective May 6.
Earlier this month, UnitedHealth posted a rare miss to its quarterly profit and lowered its annual outlook due to higher-than-expected medical costs.
The company pointed to rising medical costs in its plans for older adults - and what it termed as "unanticipated changes" in its Optum health services unit that was viewed as the growth engine of the conglomerate's business.
UnitedHealth had a rough 2024, as it dealt with an aftermath of a cyberattack at its tech unit, elevated medical costs and public backlash after the murder of its insurance unit head, Brian Thompson, late last year.
In January, the company named insider Tim Noel to lead the health insurance business.
