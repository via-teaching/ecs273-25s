We recently published a list of How Did Jim Cramer’s 12 Bold Predictions Play Out?. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently discussed.
During the most recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer revisited the recent turbulence in artificial intelligence stocks, three months after the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI firm that initially rattled markets. He noted that despite the broad pullback in the sector, many of the fears triggered by DeepSeek’s debut have not materialized, which has led to a reconsideration of the panic that followed.
“Three months ago, January 23rd is a day that will live in artificial intelligence infamy. That’s when we learned that a Chinese firm called DeepSeek had figured out a way to train high quality generative AI models using far less hardware. They claim their hardware costs were around $6 million versus $80 to $100 million for their enormous American competitors.”

The announcement sent shockwaves through the market. Cramer recalled how NVIDIA saw its stock fall sharply over just two trading sessions. The market reaction spread quickly beyond and hit other companies tied to data center infrastructure, which eventually pulled down the broader Nasdaq. However, Cramer noted that the company then revealed plans to build $500 billion worth of AI infrastructure in the United States over the next four years.
Cramer noted that initially, it seemed to signal a renewed sense of stability. But soon after, the administration imposed a ban on selling AI chips to China, which forced the GPU kingpin to write down $5.5 billion tied to that entire initiative. Even so, Cramer emphasized that the company’s core business remained strong.
“We understand that they’re basically sold out for the year, even as they can only sell their best stuff in the United States and the 18 friendly countries.”
Cramer attributed the export restrictions to a policy from former President Biden, one that President Trump has not reversed. Despite the geopolitical constraints, Cramer stressed that demand for the company’s technology is still overwhelming. He argued that the stock never should have experienced such a steep drop in the first place. He added:
“Even with the trade war, the AI infrastructure theme seems totally back on track. In fact, it never left the track to begin with.”

The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the iconic beverage giant, was mentioned back then in relation to a strong earnings report that was overshadowed by a market selloff. Jim Cramer called the market irrational at the time and followed it up with an interview with its CEO James Quincey. Here’s what he said:
“Look, this is really important—I don’t want you to let today’s ugly tape scare you away from some great earnings stories. Take Coca-Cola. Reported an excellent beat-and-raise quarter this morning but because the whole market got slammed the stock actually went down. It should have gone up. It’s absurd. […]
Cramer’s bullish sentiment around The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was warranted and its shares have risen by 16.62% since then.
Addressing the most recent pullback in consumer product stocks, Cramer once again gave a positive opinion on the stock, saying this on the 25th of April:
“On the other side of the economic spectrum, we have Coca-Cola. It’ll be interesting to see if Coca-Cola can maintain its momentum. It’s the only stock in the consumer products group that I follow that’s still hanging in there after a brutal week for the cohort. Did you see PepsiCo? Holy cow.”
Overall, KO ranks 7th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of KO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.
