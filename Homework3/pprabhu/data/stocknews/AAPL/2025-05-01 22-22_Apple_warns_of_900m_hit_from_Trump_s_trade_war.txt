Apple faces the prospect of paying almost $1bn in extra costs thanks to Donald Trump’s trade war, its boss has said.

Tim Cook, the tech giant’s chief executive, told analysts on Thursday: “Currently we are not able to precisely estimate the impact of tariffs as we are uncertain of potential future actions...if no new tariffs are added we estimate the impact to add $900m to our costs.”

Apple has been caught up in Donald Trump’s tariff blitz, with millions of iPhones sold in China every month. Many of Apple’s biggest suppliers, such as Foxconn, make its products in China.

Last month, Mr Trump exempted smartphones and computers from his most punishing duties on China, although the products are still subject to a 20pc levy as part of the President’s so-called “fentanyl” tariff.

The California giant has begun shifting manufacturing for iPhones destined for the US to India, in order to avoid the worst of the levies.

Apple’s shares dipped 1.8pc as its China sales just missed forecasts. Its China sales came in at $16bn, slightly down on the previous year. Analysts at Emarketer said Apple’s better-than-expected iPhone sales could be down to consumers attempting to get ahead of America’s tariff crackdown.

However, the company surprised the market with better than expected sales of iPhones over the first three months of 2025.

Apple reported net sales of $95.4bn, up 5pc, and net profit of $24.8bn. Its iPhone sales of $46.8bn came well ahead of Wall Street expectations.
