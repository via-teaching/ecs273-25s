NOV Inc. NOV reported first-quarter 2025 adjusted earnings of 19 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents. The bottom line decreased from the year-ago quarter’s 30 cents. This underperformance can be attributed to margin pressures on projects within its Energy Equipment segment. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)
The oil and gas equipment and services company’s total revenues of $2.1 billion marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.2%, driven by stronger-than-expected revenues from the Energy Equipment segment. The segment’s revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.6%.  However, revenues declined 8.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.
During the first quarter of 2025, NOV repurchased 5.4 million shares of common stock for $81 million. Including dividend payments, the company returned a total of $109 million in capital to its shareholders.
Additionally, NOV recorded $13 million in Other Items, primarily due to severance expenses and the deconsolidation of its Russian subsidiaries, following the imposition of new U.S. sanctions on the country’s operations during the quarter.

Energy Products and Services: The unit reported first-quarter revenues of $992 million, which missed our prediction of $998.6 million. The figure also decreased from the prior-year quarter’s reported number by 2.5%, primarily caused by lower industry activity levels, which disproportionately impacted demand for the segment’s shorter-cycle capital equipment offerings.
Adjusted EBITDA of $145 million missed our estimate of $153 million. The reported actuals also decreased from $174 million in the corresponding period of 2024.
Energy Equipment: Revenues in this segment decreased 2.7% year over year to $1.1 billion. However, the figure beat our estimation by 1%. The year-over-year drop in revenues was mostly because the company sold its Pole Products business in early 2024 and saw lower revenues from aftermarket support.
Adjusted EBITDA of $165 million beat our estimate of $139.9 million. The reported actuals also increased from $119 million in the corresponding period of 2024.
This segment experienced strong demand with new orders of $437 million in the quarter, indicating an increase of $47 million from a year ago, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 80.
As of March 31, the backlog for Energy Equipment capital orders was $4.4 billion, indicating an increase of $458 million from the prior year.
As of March 31, 2025, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion and long-term debt of $1.7 billion with a debt-to-capitalization of 20.7%. The company had $1.5 billion available on its primary revolving credit facility during the same time.
NOV generated $135 million in operating cash flow and $51 million in free cash flow in this quarter.
For the second quarter of 2025, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects consolidated revenues to decline 1% to 4% year over year, with adjusted EBITDA predicted to be between $250 million and $280 million.
The company plans to return at least 50% of its excess free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of quarterly dividends, opportunistic stock buybacks and a supplemental dividend, aligning with the strategy to enhance shareholder value.

While we have discussed NOV’s first-quarter results in detail, let us take a look at three other key reports in this space.
Oil and gas equipment and services provider, Liberty Energy LBRT, reported a first-quarter 2025 adjusted net income of 4 cents per share, which marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. Liberty's outperformance indicated operational efficiencies as well as increased utilization of frac and wireline fleets. However, the bottom line underperformed the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of 48 cents due to a decline in service activity.
As of March 31, Liberty had approximately $24.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. The pressure pumper’s long-term debt of $210 million represented a debt-to-capitalization of 9.6%.
Another oil and gas equipment and services provider, Halliburton Company HAL, posted first-quarter 2025 adjusted net income per share of 60 cents. The figure met with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but was down from the year-ago quarter’s profit of 76 cents (adjusted). The numbers reflect softer activity in the region of North America, partly offset by international growth. Meanwhile, Halliburton’s revenues of $5.4 billion decreased 6.7% year over year but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.3 billion.
As of March 31, 2025, Halliburton had approximately $1.8 billion in cash/cash equivalents and $7.2 billion in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 40.8.
Houston, TX-based oil and gas equipment and services provider, Baker Hughes BKR, reported first-quarter 2025 adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. The bottom line also improved from the year-ago level of 43 cents.
As of March 31, 2025, Baker had cash and cash equivalents of $3,277 million. Baker had a long-term debt of $5,969 million at the end of the reported quarter, with a debt-to-capitalization of 25.9%.
