We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Game Plan for This Week: 16 Stocks in Focus. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.
On Friday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer took a close look at what he called one of the most important stretches of the earnings season, which came alongside major economic developments.
“We made it. Yep, we got through another stretch without the White House upending the whole market, which therefore led to the second-best week of the year.”

Still, Cramer warned that the real challenge lies ahead, as the market now enters another week where important earnings are reported. He expressed concern that the reprieve from political interference may be short-lived, just as investors need to stay focused on corporate performance. Cramer pointed out that clarity on President Trump’s influence won’t be long in coming. With the president in Europe for a funeral, Cramer speculated he may still pursue trade talks behind the scenes.
“But there’s no doubt that he’s going to probably try to nail down some trade deals this weekend, maybe with emissaries from Japan and South Korea. Hey bears, be aware, if any country’s willing to compromise with Trump, the rest of the world might fall in line. And honestly, if we can’t win over Japan and South Korea, two countries where we have a ton of military bases, well, we might as well throw in the towel.”
Looking ahead to the end of the week, Cramer emphasized the significance of Friday’s upcoming non-farm payroll report from the Labor Department. The prior week’s market strength, he noted, was partially due to President Trump taking a break from criticizing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Cramer hoped that the restraint would last, though he remained skeptical, calling it a “temporary stay of execution.” The data on employment could shape the Fed’s next move, he explained.
Cramer believes that a weaker jobs number might help Powell justify a rate cut in the near future. He added that the Fed is in a tough spot: “It’s mighty hard to cut rates when you’re raising the price of everything imported by a pretty hefty sum.” The central bank, he said, must balance economic pressure from tariffs with the need to act quickly if unemployment rises sharply. While he doubts the Fed can afford to make a move right now, he stressed that they must be ready to cut rates at the next meeting if job losses spike.
“Here’s the bottom line: This is a really consequential week ahead. We’re about to get into the weeds with tariffs, and we have to sort out what’s real and what’s just mandated by the president. Most important, we need to see some trade deals, please. With them, the market can absorb some earnings disappointments, but without them… things could get really ugly very quickly after the run up we just had.”
For this article, we compiled a list of 16 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 25. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was mentioned during the episode, and here’s what Mad Money’s host had to say:
“Friday’s important, not just because we have Exxon and Chevron. Hey, by the way, the two largest oil companies, and I doubt that they’ll really… have anything good to say because look at the price of oil.”
Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) explores, produces, refines, and sells oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and specialty products. The company is also investing in lower-emission technologies, including carbon capture, hydrogen, and lithium. Over the past year, XOM stock has gone down more than 8%. Additionally, it is worth noting that when Cramer was asked about the company in February, he commented:
“You know, look, frankly, I’d rather see you in Chevron if you could do that… but I, no, we wanna stay away from Exxon… It’s just, it’s, it’s not where the action is.”
Overall, XOM ranks 15th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.
