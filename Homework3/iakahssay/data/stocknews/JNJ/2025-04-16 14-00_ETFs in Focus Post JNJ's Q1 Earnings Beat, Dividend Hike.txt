Content: Johnson & Johnson JNJ reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter 2025 results. The world's biggest healthcare products maker continued with its long streak of earnings beat and also exceeded revenue estimates. It raised its revenue guidance for this year amid tariff chaos and boosted its quarterly dividends.Given the resilience of the drugmaker amid the potential tariff shifts under the Trump administration, investors should tap the company’s growth prospects through ETFs with the largest allocation to this diversified drug maker. These includeiShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETFIHE,iShares U.S. Healthcare ETFIYH,First Trust Nasdaq Pharmaceuticals ETFFTXH,Health Care Select Sector SPDR FundXLV andVanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETFPPH.JNJ’s first-quarter earnings per share came in at $2.77, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 and improved 2.2% from the year-ago earnings.

Sales of JNJ’s top-selling blood cancer treatment, Darzalex, jumped 20% to $3.2 billion, while Xarelto generated $690 million in sales, up 33% year over year. However, sales of the blockbuster psoriasis drug Stelara declined 34% to $1.6 billion due to the launch of several biosimilar versions entering the market. Invega Sustenna sales also dropped 15% to $903 million.Johnson & Johnson raised its revenue guidance for fiscal 2025 to $91.0-$91.8 billion from $89.2-$90.0 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 2.6%-3.6% versus the prior expectation of 0.5%-1.5%. The new guidance reflects the addition of Caplyta (lumateperone) following its $14.6 billion acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies. The company maintained its adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of $10.50-$10.70 due to tariff costs, dilution from the Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition, and updated foreign exchange.
