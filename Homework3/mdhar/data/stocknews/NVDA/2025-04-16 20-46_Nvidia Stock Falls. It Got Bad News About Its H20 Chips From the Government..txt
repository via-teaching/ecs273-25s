The U.S.-China tech war just claimed another high-profile casualty.
On Wednesday, Walmart (NYSE: WMT) stock was guilty by association in the eyes of the market, a dynamic reflected in a share price drop of nearly 3%.  A top investment bank published a downbeat research note on a major peer in the retail world, and the bearishness spread to Walmart's stock.  Overall, however, few investors were enthusiastic about any stocks, as Walmart's decline was only slightly steeper than the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 2.2% dip.
World stocks fell into a downward spiral on Wednesday led by tech losses after Washington said it is putting new curbs on AI chip exports to China, marking an escalation in the global trade war.  The Trump administration's latest broadside sparked huge demand for safe-haven assets like gold, the Swiss franc and U.S. Treasuries, even though Fed Chair Jerome Powell signalled he is in no rush to cut interest rates.

Nvidia shares fell more than 6% in after-hours trading.  The H20 chips have far less processing power than the latest top-of-the-line Nvidia processors.
The ban on sales of the H20 chips calls into question the company’s ability to continually beat Wall Street’s lofty expectations.
