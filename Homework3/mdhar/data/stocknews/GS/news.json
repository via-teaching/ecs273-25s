Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates in a worst-case scenario, the hit this year from reduced travel and boycotts could total 0.3% of gross domestic product, which would amount to almost $90 billion.\nForeign tourism has been a tailwind for the US in recent years as the cessation of pandemic-era restrictions sparked a resurgence of international travel. But many potential visitors are now rethinking their vacation plans amid increased hostility at the border, rising geopolitical frictions and global economic uncertainty.\nOne of them is Curtis Allen, a Canadian videographer who canceled an upcoming US vacation after President Donald Trump imposed punitive tariffs on his home country and suggested it should become the 51st US state. Allen and his partner have been on multiple camping trips to Oregon over the years, but this year, they will be traveling around British Columbia instead.\n“We’re not just staying home,” said Allen, 34. “We’re going to go spend the same money somewhere else.”\nAllen’s hesitance doesn’t stop there. He canceled his Netflix subscription and is actively avoiding American imports at the grocery store.\n“Now it takes us double the time, because we’re looking at where the products came from,” he said.\nInternational travelers spent a record $254 billion in the US last year, according to ITA figures. Coming into 2025, the outlook was positive: The ITA projected in early March that the US would welcome 77 million visitors this year, just shy of the 2019 record, before pushing to a new high in 2026.\nBut those estimates came out just before stories of harsh detentions at US airports, ensnaring travelers from countries like France and Germany, started making headlines. Major public institutions in Canada, including a pension management firm and a leading hospital, are now advising staff against traveling to the US.\nAlmost $20 billion in retail spending from international tourists in the US may be at risk, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis.\nEarly signs of a sharp pullback are already showing up. Airfares, hotel rates and car rental costs fell in March, according to a monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics report on consumer prices published April 10. Economists at Goldman Sachs and HSBC Holdings Plc said lower demand, including from foreign travelers, probably played a role.\nOmair Sharif, president of Inflation Insights, noted the decline in hotel rates was driven by an almost 11% drop in the Northeast in particular, possibly a result of fewer Canadians traveling there.\n“Given what we know about how much Canadian travel has fallen off, that’s potentially a bit worrying for that region,” Sharif said.\nThe timing is “very interesting” for Rainbow Air Helicopter Tours in Niagara Falls — which just invested $25 million in a new building, an enhanced fleet and a virtual reality attraction ahead of the busy summer season — said Patrick Keyes, the firm’s sales and marketing manager. “We are waiting to see the fallout,” he said.\nCanadian flight reservations to the US are down 70% through September versus the same period last year, according to a report by OAG Aviation Worldwide. Meanwhile US summer bookings are also down 25% among European tourists at Accor SA hotels — which Chief Executive Officer Sébastien Bazin said could be attributed to border detentions creating a “bad buzz” and diverting tourists to other destinations.\n“US tariff announcements and a more aggressive stance toward historical allies have hurt global opinions about the US,” Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Megan Peters said in a March 31 report.\n“This headwind provides another reason — in addition to the more direct negative impacts of tariffs and drag on exports from foreign retaliation that are already built into our US GDP forecast — why US GDP growth will likely underperform consensus expectations in 2025,” they said.\nDespite the worsening outlook, Oregon’s tourism commission — known as Travel Oregon — is continuing efforts to attract foreign visitors, said CEO Todd Davidson. His team just came back from a trip to pitch the state at an adventure tourism conference in Vancouver, and in the coming weeks they will be hosting sales and marketing partners from places like the UK, India and Brazil.\nAt the same time, they’re also contemplating whether the commission will need to shift its strategy more toward domestic visitors as the situation unfolds.\n“Oregon is not and will not take its eye off those international markets,” Davidson said. “We will be here when our international visitors feel that they are ready to return.”\n(Updates to add Canada executives advising against US travel in ninth paragraph.)\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nRisks are mounting but, overall, the economy is still in a good place, according to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.\nCEOs have warned on the economy because of Trump administration tariff policies. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has a message for them all.\nLast week's rally in the broader stock market indexes sprung the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) back upward after a more than 20% that technically put it into a bear market.  Income investors looking at the current landscape may be wondering if now is the best time to buy dividend stocks given the wild swings to the upside and the downside.

Recent tensions between the U.S. and China may have injected some volatility, yet the company's robust earnings and share repurchase likely supported its impressive performance.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\nOn Friday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer outlined what investors should focus on in the week, especially pointing to earnings reports from major banks.\n“Rumor, innuendo, intrigue these are the stuff of great novels, of fabulous miniseries, riveting plays, and now they’re the stuff of the stock market.”\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks and 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently.\nHe noted the chaotic nature of the current environment and remarked that “this tape has it all,” and emphasized how unpredictable developments from the White House have added to the turbulence. Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes.\n“Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,” he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, “Except this isn’t an eight-part blockbuster, it’s our money.” Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday’s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic.\nCramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a “liberation day bottom,” a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, “Not sure, I’m just not sure.” He added:\n“Have you ever noticed the weekends don’t provide relaxation anymore because the president’s got advisors? He’s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He’s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime…. Monday’s trading, well, let’s just say that it looks like that it’s earning season so it’s gonna be even harder than usual.”\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NYSE:GS) was mentioned during the episode, and here’s what he had to say:\n“Alright, well, let’s start with Goldman Sachs, right? That’s what it’s, it’s the first bank stock. It’s the first stock that reports this week and I’ve gotta tell you, usually doesn’t report on Mondays. It’s interesting. JPMorgan stole the show today with a monster good quarter. Wells Fargo was too run of the mill. That one hurt me for my Charitable Trust. I don’t know… Morgan Stanley, better. Goldman’s by far the most controversial. Why? Because as an investment bank, its business can be pretty episodic.\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is a financial firm known for investment banking. It also provides wealth management services and other financial solutions.\nOverall, GS ranks 1st on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of GS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in.\nAs we recently discussed in another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’s Berkshire picks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.\nOverall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio. So, let’s take a look at the top Goldman Sachs value stocks.\nEngineers using the latest Cisco TelePresence technology to collaborate with colleagues around the world.\nTo compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

This will offer businesses a safe, flexible, and simple way to create and manage AI systems without losing performance or protection.\nOn February 12, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share, up 3% compared to the last quarter. The dividend will be paid on April 23, to shareholders listed by April 3. Cisco’s board also approved a $15 billion boost to its share repurchase program, bringing the total available for buybacks to around $17 billion.\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 84 hedge funds were long Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), up from 60 funds in the prior quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 13.8 million shares valued at $821.7 million.\nOverall, CSCO ranks 12th among the Goldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks. While we acknowledge the potential of value stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Cargo data last week already showed a slowdown in the volume of goods processed by Chinese ports, foreshadowing a decline in commerce as global companies pause orders and reduce output.\nThe improvement is “all in the past now,” said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale SA. “Stimulus delivery is still pretty urgent. Things can deteriorate fairly quickly with some high-frequency data showing tariff impact on US-bound shipments.”\nIn a sign that tariff fears prevailed, Chinese stocks in Hong Kong extended their losses to as much as 3.3%. The yuan was steady at 7.3297 in the offshore market, while the 10-year government bond yield fell 2 basis points to 1.63%.\nThe data released by the National Bureau of Statistics suggests the economy was supported in part by front-loaded shipments before tariffs jumped to prohibitive levels this month.\nWithout more stimulus, China could struggle to meet its official growth target of around 5% this year. Exports are expected to contract after contributing to a third of growth in 2024, while business and consumer sentiment will likely suffer a blow from the trade war.\nEconomists at international banks including UBS Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. and Societe Generale have lowered their forecasts for China’s 2025 growth in recent weeks to around 4% or lower. Australia & New Zealand Banking Group announced a similar downgrade following the data release.\nThe Chinese economy’s performance this year will largely depend on how much stimulus Beijing rolls out and how quickly it deploys support measures. A key factor will be the sustainability of the recovery in consumer demand, which has been buoyed by subsidies for buying cars, appliances and smartphones.\nSome economists expect the People’s Bank of China to cut interest rates or the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve as soon as this month, while others predicted several trillions of yuan in additional fiscal borrowing and spending to fill the gap left by declined exports.\nThe government could also provide targeted help to exporters by expediting tax rebate payouts or offering them cheaper loans, according to Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc.\nA meeting by the Communist Party’s decision-making Politburo at the end of April will likely provide further clues to policymakers’ thinking when it comes to the timing and size of stimulus. With the positive data, the risk is that officials could decide to act only when growth hits a wall.\n“The government may wait to observe the magnitude of the slowdown in exports and react accordingly,” Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.\nOff to a Good Start\nData released Wednesday showed industrial output expanding 7.7% in March from a year ago, the fastest growth since June 2021. Retail sales increased 5.9%, the best pace since December 2023 and much stronger than the 4.3% gain expected by economists.\nThe NBS struck a note of caution even as it released the positive indicators, emphasizing the need for greater support for the economy.\n“The external environment is becoming more complex and severe, and the drive for growth of effective domestic demand is insufficient,” the bureau said in a statement. “We must implement more proactive and effective macro policies.”\nHighlights of other key economic indicators:\nFixed-asset investment rose 4.2% in the first three months of 2025, and property investment contracted 9.9%. Both are largely in line with expectations\nThe urban jobless rate was 5.2% in March, dropping from 5.4% in the previous month\nThe surprise improvement in the industrial sector is in line with a surge in exports in March. The production of computers and other electronics picked up, soaring 13% last month from a year ago. Steel, cement and electricity output all accelerated, also supported by the government’s push to build infrastructure projects early this year.\nFor consumption, home appliances and furniture led the expansion with sales growing about 30% in March from a year ago, thanks to government subsidies. However, some unsubsidized goods such as cosmetics and clothing expanded only modestly, suggesting potential weakness in underlying sentiment.\nCatering spending accelerated to the fastest in a year, as a number of local governments rolled out discount vouchers to encourage dining out and tourism spending.\nThe government is increasingly looking at services as a potential source for growth after previously focusing measures on boosting spending on goods. In a work plan released Wednesday, authorities including the Ministry of Commerce listed 48 measures to expand household spending in catering, health care, entertainment and tourism and sports.\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n“Looking ahead, the picture looks a lot more challenging, with high US tariffs likely to slam external demand. We expect policymakers to step up stimulus urgently, front-loading this year’s big budget and cutting rates and reserve requirements.”\n— Chang Shu and David Qu\nRead the full note here.\nIn a sign of an imbalance between supply and demand, the economy continued to suffer from persisting deflation. The GDP deflator — a broad measure of prices across the economy — declined for the eighth consecutive quarter. That’s the longest streak since the quarterly data began in 1993.\nHighlighting the urgency to shore up domestic demand, Premier Li Qiang visited a consumer goods exhibition in Beijing on Tuesday.\nHe called on business representatives to be “united” to overcome difficulties and actively diversify markets, including compensating export losses with domestic sales. Officials should make greater efforts to stabilize employment, boost people’s income and strength social security to encourage consumer spending, and guide companies to compete in a healthy way, he said.\nLi was also debriefed by the city government regarding progress in the purchases of unsold homes, pledging to “study and launch new supportive policies in a timely manner.” The property market is still far from reaching a turning point, Wednesday’s data showed.\n“China can only count on domestic consumption,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. “The retail sales figure is encouraging. Whether it can be sustainable depends on how fast and large the stimulus package will be.”\n--With assistance from Zhu Lin and Iris Ouyang.\n(Updates with more details, comments throughout.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nFaced with the fear of rising tariffs, importers continued to stock up on foreign goods, fueling a surge in February shipments.\n(Bloomberg) -- The Stellantis NV assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario, rises like an industrial temple on the city’s outskirts.

Revenue also rose at all of these banks. Trading revenue alone jumped 17% to more than $36 billion.\nMany banks said their consumer customers were still spending, defaults were still manageable, and businesses were not experiencing distress despite the uncertainty about the months ahead. None of the institutions with big Wall Street footprints updated their earnings outlooks for the rest of the year, either.\nWhat these results didn't include, however, was the volatile period that followed Trump's April 2 \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement, which took place two days after the quarter ended. Stocks and bonds plunged and have yet to fully recover, ushering in new uncertainty about the economy and the safety of US assets.\n\"We're surprised about the degree of ongoing firmwide strength at all 5 big banks ... and the more than expected upbeat views,\" said Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo in a Tuesday note.\n\"To us, it all says that events since Apr 2 can still be little more than a speed bump, so long as policy moves faster to help ease most of the uncertainty,\" he added, in reference to promised deregulation of the banking industry expected from the Trump administration.\nNot that banks and their top executives were entirely upbeat. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said that the prospect of a recession \"has increased.\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the economy faces \"considerable turbulence,\" with a recession as a \"likely outcome.\"\nIn such a scenario, he added, \"earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down.\"\nBut many bankers were noticeably more optimistic. The word \"recession\" did not come up once on Citigroup's Tuesday earnings calls with analysts. Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, also offered an optimistic vision of the current turmoil.\n\"When all is said and done, and longstanding trade imbalances and other structural shifts are behind us, the U.S. will still be the world's leading economy,\" she said in a statement with the bank's Tuesday earnings release.\nBrian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, went out of his way on Tuesday to note that his bank's research team doesn't see a recession happening in 2025.\nRead more: What is a recession, and how does it impact you?\nUS consumers, he added, keep \"pushing money into the economy,\" and the lender's business clients \"remain profitable, liquid and have strong results.\"\nBut \"nobody has a perfect crystal ball,\" Moynihan acknowledged, noting that \"we potentially face a changing economy in the future.\"\nSome banks even showed a rise in investment banking income during the first quarter, defying predictions of a slowdown. Executives acknowledged some deals were now on hold due to uncertainties, but many described the pullbacks as temporary rather than long-lasting.\n\"I'm saying pause versus delete,\" Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick told analysts of the current investment banking environment. \"We don't know whether the economy is going to contract.\"\nEven amid the optimism, there were signs that banks are preparing for harder times. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo (WFC) added $8.4 billion in provisions to account for future loan losses.\nThe figure was 29% higher than the year-ago period and 9% higher than the previous quarter.\n\"We're still in a cloudy period.

Brent crude futures fell 21 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $64.67 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 20 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $61.33.  The International Energy Agency followed on Tuesday with its projection that global oil demand in 2025 will grow at its slowest rate for five years due to worries about economic growth from Trump’s trade tariffs.\nWith President Donald Trump announcing a wide set of tariffs, there could be increased costs for a range of companies.

But an outgrowth of shifting tariff policies has sparked another lucrative exchange on Wall Street: the volatility trade.\nA surge in trading activity has shuttled billions of dollars to the nation’s largest banks as investors have attempted to protect their money or deploy it in the face of market gyrations.\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's \n                        \n                            Terms\n                        \n                     and \n                        \n                            Privacy Policy\n                        \n\nEarnings reports from the big five banks in recent days revealed they collectively raked in nearly $37 billion in trading revenue this past quarter, touting record sales from equities changing hands.\nWarren Buffett famously urged investors to “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” A corollary for the financial institutions facilitating those trades is to sit back in any environment and collect fees.\nWall Street wants stocks to go up, sure, but most importantly, it just wants stocks to move.\nThe big banks' trading may mostly be for hedge funds, pensions, and large companies — big institutional investors. But everyone's rolling up their sleeves at the volatility and tinkering with their portfolios, looking to optimize or take advantage of the moment.\nAs my colleague Josh Schafer reports, everybody's trading. Dip-buying flows following the week of “Liberation Day” reached record levels, according to data from VandaTrack, including $3 billion in net purchases on April 3. That was the largest daily total since VandaTrack began collecting the data in 2014.\nBuying at recent lows and FOMO trading explained much of the heightened activity.

But pushing an order on a trading app has become something of a pastime for an increasingly large American demographic, the foundation for group chats among young people, and the basis for an entire genre of aspirational lifestyle content.\nThat big banks' big shot clients are doing this too is a great \"stars, they're just like us\" moment. But it's also part and parcel of the same volatility that's been a hallmark of the 2025 stock market and a lesson in the importance of a diversified portfolio of banks' business lines.\nThat these banks can up their profitability amid economic uncertainty and a lack of an anticipated IPO boom isn’t unique to volatile trading. A similar dynamic was at play earlier this year, when a major market narrative was whether the Fed would continue to ease rates. (The Fed cut rates in September, November, and December but has since paused.)\nFurther rate cuts would have curtailed banks’ lending margins, which were supercharged by the central bank’s years-long tightening campaign. But the big banks could have done just fine in a low-rate environment because they can lean on other commercial operations to cover revenue losses elsewhere.\nThe diversified nature of financial services allows the nation's biggest banks to profit even when the outlook grows darker. It's not clear how the American exceptionalism trade will unfold in the months ahead. Tax cuts and other business-friendly deregulatory efforts are in the offing.\nIn the meantime, as long as money is still moving and greasing the trading gears, at least one part of Wall Street will be happy.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Some top leaders have expressed to me that the tariffs are putting their businesses into a state of chaos.\nBessent added, \"They'll [CEOs] also have clarity on tax and on deregulation. I remember in 2017 I heard a lot of the same things because the tax deal wasn't done until right before Christmas in 2017. And it was the same thing. We can't plan. We can't do this. We need clarity. So, you know, we're going to have clarity on tax. We're going to have clarity on deregulation.\"\nRead more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\nCorporate America has sounded the alarm on the state of the economy amid the tariff turmoil.\nJPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said in a recent TV interview that a recession is likely. Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon told analysts on his earnings call on Monday that the prospect of a recession has increased.\nBessent's hedge fund mentor Stanley Druckenmiller has weighed in on X that he doesn't support tariffs above 10%.\n\"Well, the consumer is concerned about a number of things ... the pricing and costs of things, inflation,\" Constellation Brands (STZ) CEO Bill Newlands told me on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts. \"They're concerned about immigration, particularly consumers that have had friends or family who have been involved with issues around immigration. How that's translating is that people are spending less. They're out less in restaurants. They're spending less on consumer goods and consumables.\"\nThe Corona and Modelo beer maker has seen beer sales go flat amid the economic uncertainty.\nBessent said about the recession concerns from Dimon and Solomon: \"Look, that's their job is to be concerned. But again, I think that there is all this chatter on tariffs and what we're worried about. And, you know, I come from Wall Street, I think Wall Street can continue to do great, but we are focused on Main Street.\"\nThe concerns from CEOs have been well placed.\nOn April 9, the Trump administration announced a 90-day pause on all reciprocal tariffs, with the exception being China. The tariffs on China, one of the US's most important trading partners, now stand at 145%.\nA 10% across-the-board tax is still being applied to all imports to the US.\nThe administration further refined its tariff plans on April 11.\nThe White House issued a rule that spared smartphones, computers, semiconductors, and other electronics from reciprocal tariffs — especially the harsher ones on Chinese goods. The US Customs and Border Patrol said that the goods would be excluded from Trump's 10% global tariff on most countries and the much more significant 145% tariffs on Chinese imports.\nBessent suggested a trade deal with China remains in the distance.\nTrump quickly downplayed that he was reversing course on tariffs, noting electronics would still get hit.\n\"There was no Tariff ‘exception’,\" Trump said in a social media post on Sunday. \"These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket.'\"\nThe administration is working on a semiconductor tariff, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) has recovered to a decline of 4.67% beneath its level at the April 2 tariff announcement, but a decline is still a decline.

There have been relentless protests in many cities in California - echoing the backlash in other countries - against Musk's involvement in U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and his embrace of far-right politics in Europe, a key factor behind Tesla's 13% drop in first-quarter deliveries globally.\nMiddle Coast Investing, an investment advisor firm, released its first-quarter investor letter.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) stands against other key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes.\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer reacted to the partial tariff exemptions announced by the White House, interpreting them not as a full retreat, but as a strategic pause designed to avoid punishing American companies. He suggested the administration was being careful not to hand over competitive advantages to Southeast Asian rivals, particularly Samsung:\n“So what I saw today, and not to be facetious, but what I see is people saying, you know what, we’ve seen the downside. Maybe we can test it again. But the president has, I don’t want to say blink, because that’s nonsense. What the president did was say, OK, look, we’re not going to continue to punish American companies and give the green light to Korea. I don’t know if you heard Lutnick’s words. He was very specific. Southeast Asia. That’s Samsung. They didn’t want to give the ball to Samsung.”\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Hints at a Bigger Agenda Behind Tariffs and Breaks Down These 7 Stocks and Jim Cramer Reacts to the Surprise Market Surge and Highlights 8 Key Stocks.\nTurning to currency dynamics, Cramer pushed back on what he sees as misplaced panic over a weakening U.S. dollar. Instead, he argued that a softer dollar actually benefits American multinationals and gives long-needed relief to CFOs who’ve spent years blaming currency strength for lost market share:\n“Well, look, I’m not so certain I’m going to do a little contrary stuff on the dollar here. When we listen to conference calls, for the last four years, all we hear about is it would have been so much better if the dollar weren’t so strong. We keep losing share, the dollar’s too strong. Suddenly the dollar’s weaker, and now we start hearing all the downside, what, the bonds? I mean, I’m almost thinking that, I’m gonna put this out there, the people who are saying that it’s the end of the world, that the dollar is weaker, I think they have to go do some work boots on the ground. […] So suddenly the dollar’s weaker and we are petrified? These are people who have an agenda. And their agenda is to say, you know what matters more than anything else? Our hegemony from a strong dollar. And I don’t get it. If you’re in our business of picking stocks, you’re sick and tired of hearing CFOs say, we are done. We’ve got to stop this dollar rise.”\nCramer also gave his opinion about the rhetoric coming from Beijing, likening it to the Cold War-era paranoia of the 1960s and ’70s. He questioned whether a diplomatic breakthrough similar to Nixon’s historic visit to China is even possible under the current tone of U.S.-China relations:\n“But when I listen to the rhetoric from China, this is the 1968-72 rhetoric. It’s the kind of rhetoric that just says there’s never going to be a meeting. Is there a way to have a Nixon to China moment? Because as far as I’m concerned, this is just right now you’re on the verge of when I was a little boy and we kept thinking, when are they going to bomb us? I mean, that was the same rhetoric. When are they going to launch their nuclear weapons? I mean, that’s why we used to live in fear. That’s why we had cubbyholes. That’s why we used to put our heads in a cubbyhole, because the Chinese were going to bomb us if the Russians didn’t bomb us. This is the same sound.”\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on April 14th.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NYSE:GS) in the context of its latest earnings report, highlighting both its strengths and potential challenges. While the bank reported a strong quarter driven by equities trading revenue, Cramer noted that activity in investment banking remains muted due to macro uncertainty. Here is his full analysis:\n“Well, we need the buyback. Now, they did buy back 7 million shares with a $610 basis. You’re obviously nowhere near that. What Goldman excels at is helping clients in a time of turmoil. And they did great there, but net interest income was good too. But when you take a look at investment banking, look, they’re just debt underwriting. They’re just not making a lot of money in debt underwriting. […]\nOverall, GS ranks 7th on our list of key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes. While we acknowledge the potential of GS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Analysts at Bank of America, Piper Sandler, and Raymond James lowered their price targets for the chipmaker stock.\nApple's (AAPL) India suppliers shipped $2 billion worth of iPhones in March ahead of US President Trump's tariffs.\nWall Street's top financial firms, like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS), saw record-high trading revenue in the first quarter, driven by tariff-fueled market volatility.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.\nIt's now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Nvidia, Apple, and Wall Street banks. First up, several Wall Street firms cutting their price targets on Nvidia stock after the chip maker disclosed that it anticipates a $5.5 billion charge from new chip curbs. The US government told Nvidia earlier this month it would need a special license to export certain chips to China. Analysts at BFA Global Research, Piper Sandler, and Raymond James all lowering their price targets on the news. And also, Steve, what I also thought was really interesting here is an analyst over at City talking about how it's not just about Nvidia. This could also impact Broadcom. This could also impact other chip names in the space.\nWell, you're seeing them, you're seeing them sell off today. I mean, you know, AMD announced an $800 million charge along in there. Um, you know, Broadcom was trading lower this morning as well. ASML was trading lower, although they released earnings, but, but they're all, they're all part and parcel of this. This is not good news for the chip sector, because, you know, I, I don't mean to just sound like a broken record, but this is uncertainty, and uncertainty, the markets don't love uncertainty.\nWell, speaking, speaking of uncertainty, let's get to another name we're looking at. Apple's main suppliers in India shipping roughly $2 billion worth of iPhones in March ahead of President Trump's reciprocal tariffs announcement. That is according to new customs data. Smartphones have since secured a temporary reprieve from tariffs, but persistent tensions between the US and China threaten the iPhone maker's China-focused supply chain in the longer term. The Wall Street Journal reporting Apple is investigating moving some iPhone production to the US, but the process could take years, and CEO Tim Cook has said in the past that it would be difficult to find the skilled labor in America that's needed to build the smartphones. Treasury Secretary Scott Beson dismissed that comment and concern in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\nYou don't need a PhD in mechanical engineering to assemble an iPhone. So, I, I'm not sure why Tim Cook says that the skills aren't here.\nAnd Steve, I think what analysts who cover Apple might say and investors might say is that that skilled labor does take years to build up, and it's certainly something that allows Apple to turn out these iPhones incredibly quickly.\nWell, that's it. I mean, every, you know, labor now is not just, you know, pounding a hammer or nail. There, there's, there's, there's intricacies in the supply chain. You know, I, I know that, you know, the commerce secretary with his comment, you know, we're going to have lots of people screwing tiny little screws into things. That's not what people really want. You know, we want the high-tech value-added manufacturing because, quite frankly, our cost basis is higher. So, if there's value-added stuff to be done, that's great. If it's just, if it's just bringing low-skilled labor, bringing back low-skilled jobs, that's not necessarily, you know, I understand the need for that, particularly maybe in some strategic industries, but overall, I think we want people bringing a skill set to it. You know, I saw a statistic, this was posted on, on, on Twitter by my friend Frank Luntz who I trust. Um, and he got the statistics from the Cato Institute. 80% of the people when asked, said, do you want more manufacturing in the US? 80% said yes. When asked, would you take a factory job? 75% said no. 23% said yes. The other two said I already have a factory job. So, it, it's, you know, it's one of these, it's nice in theory, but in practice, um, you know, you need skilled, the people who are going to take these jobs, by definition, are really going to be skilled labor. Not, not just, you know, people, not just, you know, automatons screwing in screws.\nYeah. Right. The price that they're requiring for their labor requires it to be skilled. All right. Finally, trading desks at some of the biggest names in banking crashed in, cashed in, rather, on market volatility in the most recent quarter. And that is not including the past two weeks, which fell outside of that reporting period. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Goldman, all seeing record equity trading revenue during the quarter. Despite the blockbuster results, executives did express some caution about the current macro backdrop. JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon warning of considerable turbulence roiling the US economy. Well, Goldman's David Solomon said the prospects of a recession had increased. You couldn't pay Solomon to mention the word tariffs, but he did semi-maybe allude to it in that comment. Is this trading revenue for banks a signal of strength in your view, Steve? Or is this something that can kind of hide any economic macro concerns?\nKind of the latter. You know, I remember I spent the bulk of my career as an option trader, and I used, I loved environments like this. Um, you know, and to Jamie Dimon's comment, you know, about turbulence, you know, I always described VIX as sort of the price of a parachute when the plane hits turbulence at some level. You know, people want that protection. But here's what happens during volatility with, if you're an active trader. You widen your spreads, you shrink your sizes. So, effectively that really impairs liquidity, but if you're the person trading off those bid offs, bid-ask spreads, each trade you do is more profitable. And so, yes, that leads to the trading desks making more money, but really, you know, analysts typically discount that over time. It's actually a little odd this quarter that the analysts are very happy that the banks are making all this money trading because for years, again, as a trader at a publicly traded firm, the analysts were always very dismissive when we had a good quarter.\nYeah. Right, right, because it's potentially not a sign of continued gains for, for the banks. Steve, thank you so much for sticking with us.

(NYSE:GS) just kicked off its latest first-quarter results with some very strong numbers. Goldman Sachs Group beat earnings, with revenues hitting US$15b, ahead of expectations, and statutory earnings per share outperforming analyst reckonings by a solid 15%. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.\nOur free stock report includes 2 warning signs investors should be aware of before investing in Goldman Sachs Group. Read for free now.\nTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Goldman Sachs Group from 16 analysts is for revenues of US$55.2b in 2025. If met, it would imply a modest 4.1% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to increase 2.3% to US$44.52. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$56.4b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$45.10 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.\n See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group \nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$592. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Goldman Sachs Group analyst has a price target of US$720 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$490. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The analysts are definitely expecting Goldman Sachs Group's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 5.5% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 2.7% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 5.2% annually. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Goldman Sachs Group is expected to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$592, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have forecasts for Goldman Sachs Group going out to 2027, and you can see them free on our platform here.\nHowever, before you get too enthused, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group that you should be aware of.\nHave feedback on this article?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in.\nAs we recently discussed in another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’s Berkshire picks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.\nOverall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio.\nAn aerial view of an oil rig at sunrise, emphasizing the power of the natural gas transportation industry.\nTo compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nGoldman Sachs' Q4 2024 Stake Value: $1,795,751,044\nP/E Ratio as of April 11: 12.23\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 37\nEnergy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) is a Texas-based company that operates a massive network of pipelines and facilities to transport, store, and process natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids.

ET forecasts 2025 adjusted EBITDA to fall between $16.1 billion and $16.5 billion.\nOn January 28, 2025, Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.325 per share, a 0.8% increase from its prior dividend of $0.323. The dividend was paid out on February 19.\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 37 hedge funds held stakes in Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET), compared to 29 funds in the preceding quarter.

While we acknowledge the potential of value stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in.\nAs we recently discussed in another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’s Berkshire picks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.\nOverall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio.\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\nTo compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nGoldman Sachs' Q4 2024 Stake Value: $2,504,575,163\nP/E Ratio as of April 11: 12.85\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), an American multinational oil and gas titan, is one of the best Goldman Sachs value stocks. The investment firm holds 6.5 million shares of XOM worth $2.5 billion as of Q4 2024. On April 4, TD Cowen reiterated a Buy rating on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) but trimmed the price target from $128 to $125. While the company’s financial outlook has slightly shifted, analysts at TD Cowen remain confident in Exxon’s performance and share buyback plans, even if commodity prices dip. They still see it as one of the strongest picks in the energy sector.\nIn 2024, ExxonMobil reported $33.7 billion in earnings, slightly less than last year’s $36 billion. The company generated $55 billion in cash from operations and returned $36 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. It also led the industry in shareholder returns over the past 1, 3, and 5 years. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) plans to maintain its $20 billion annual share repurchase program through 2026. XOM raised its dividend for the 42nd straight year and ended 2024 with a $23.2 billion cash balance and low debt levels.\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has remodeled its oil and gas portfolio by discarding assets worth $15 billion and focusing on resources like the Permian Basin, Guyana, and LNG. The company’s full-year production came in at 4.3 million BOED, which can potentially reach 5.4 million BOED by 2030. The Pioneer acquisition boosted its Permian position, and innovation is improving recovery rates. XOM also plans to double its LNG capacity through projects in the United States, Papua New Guinea, and Mozambique.\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 104 hedge funds held long positions in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), compared to 86 funds in the earlier quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management was a significant stakeholder of the company, with 8.6 million shares valued at roughly $934 million.\nOverall, XOM ranks 6th among the Goldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks.

There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.
