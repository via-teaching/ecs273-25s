In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other American tech stocks.\nAmerican stocks moved up a bit on Monday, April 14 as investors focused on news about tech companies getting a break from President Trump’s tariffs. The S&P 500 rose by 0.8%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose by 0.6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by about 0.7%.\nREAD ALSO: 11 Best American Energy Stocks to Buy Now and 10 Best Stocks Under $10 to Buy Now.\nIn recent days, President Trump and his advisers have given mixed signals on the future of tariffs on China and on specific industries. Over the weekend, big American tech companies scored a victory when it was revealed that the US had not put tariffs on smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics.\nHowever, on Sunday, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that these electronics would soon be covered under new tariffs, which would be different from those imposed on specific countries. President Trump also posted on social media that there would be “no exception” for these products. He also said that the government is looking at semiconductors and the entire electronics supply chain in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\nLast week was the best week for the major indexes since at least 2023. However, with all this uncertainty, Wall Street is getting ready for another week of potential tariff-fueled ups and downs.\nTo compile our list of the 14 best American tech stocks to buy now, we used stock screeners from Finviz and Yahoo Finance to find the largest American technology companies. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 30 American stocks. Next, we focused on the 14 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database of more than 1,000 elite hedge funds. Finally, the 14 best American tech stocks to buy now were ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q4 2024.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 166\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American multinational technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets consumer electronics, software, and services. The company is best known for its products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers, as well as services such as the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Pay. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks among the best American stocks to invest in.\nOn April 9, Jefferies upgraded Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from “Underperform” to “Hold” but lowered the price target to $167.88 from the previous $202.33. This adjustment reflects concerns about the potential impacts of a global recession on iPhone demand and the expected price increases for future iPhone models. The analyst noted that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to be exempted from US tariffs because of its commitment to invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years. The analyst believes that the company will make further investments in US manufacturing, possibly including iPhone production. Despite this, a growing risk of a global recession could have a negative impact on iPhone demand. Jefferies has lowered its iPhone shipment forecasts by 3.6%, 7.7%, and 5.5% for fiscal years 2025, 2026, and 2027 respectively, which leads to a reduction in projected revenue by 2%, 4.1%, and 3.5% for the same fiscal years. The firm anticipates that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will raise iPhone prices by $50 in 2026 for the iPhone 18 and by $100 in 2027 for the iPhone 19. These increases in price are expected to be mainly driven by higher hardware costs. Following these revisions, Jefferies now estimates earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) lower than market consensus by 2.5%, 8.5%, and 3.4% for fiscal years 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively.\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of the best American tech stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\nApple (AAPL) closed at $202.14 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.19% move from the prior day.\nTo the relief of anyone with an aging iPhone, the Trump administration exempted smartphones, computers, and other tech products from its punishing tariffs on Chinese imports over the weekend.  While Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has geographically diversified its supply chain, the company still relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing partners for its devices.  Absent any special treatment, prices in the U.S. on Apple products would have likely risen substantially due to the tariffs.\nWe recently published a list of 12 Best Gambling Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.

Refining margins and oil output offer partial support amid its shift to fossil fuels.\nLast week's rally in the broader stock market indexes sprung the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) back upward after a more than 20% that technically put it into a bear market.

In the video, posted on X by CNBC TV18 reporter Nigel D’Souza, Cook dismissed the idea that Apple’s manufacturing in China is due to low labor costs, stating, “China stopped being a low labor cost company many years ago.”\nTrending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.\nInstead, he emphasized China’s unparalleled skilled labor concentration in one location and advanced tooling capabilities as the primary reason. Cook emphasized that “the products that we do require truly advanced tooling.”\n\nOn that note, Cook emphasized the sharp difference in vocational skills between the US and China. The Apple CEO stated, \"In the US, you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I’m not we could fill the room.\" In China, however, \"you could fill multiple football fields.... Hence, the vocational expertise in China is very deep”.\nWhy It Matters: The U.S.-China tariff war has put pressure on American companies to shift production back home. Earlier this month, a leading tech analyst predicted a significant price hike for Apple iPhones if manufacturing shifts to the U.S., potentially reaching around $3,500. This is due to the complexity of recreating the production ecosystem that currently exists in Asia.\nSee Also: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share.\nFurthermore, experts opined that Apple’s supply chain could face major disruptions due to new reciprocal tariffs. Apple had temporarily dodged steep tariffs on Chinese-made electronics following an exemption granted by Trump.\nA recent report also suggested that Apple completed an urgent logistics operation, transporting five planeloads of iPhones and other products from manufacturing centers in India and China to the U.S. within 72 hours, in a bid to beat President Donald Trump's new 10% reciprocal tariff on imports.\nGiven these complexities, Cook’s emphasis on China’s skilled labor and advanced tooling capabilities provides a clearer understanding of Apple’s manufacturing decisions.\nApple has lost over $500 billion in market capitalization since the Apr 2 ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs.

Unfortunately, Buffett recently stated he wouldn't comment on the current tariff-related negotiations and/or economic fallout until the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) annual meeting in early May.  While one might think the champion of free markets has a very clear stance on the market-distorting characteristics of tariffs, Buffett is also not a fan of the U.S. trade deficit.\nPresident&nbsp;Donald Trump&nbsp;has called on China to reach out to him in order to kick off negotiations to resolve the escalating trade fight between the world's two largest economies. As the US warns \"the ball is in China's court,\"&nbsp;China Southern Airlines has suspended the sale of 10 used Boeing Dreamliners. Bloomberg's White House Correspondent Kate Sullivan reports that China is expected to remain defiant in the face of an escalating trade fight.\nOn April 2, President Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on all physical products imported into America, which sent investors flocking to safe-haven assets like cash on fears of a global economic slowdown.  Shares of Nvidia and Alphabet are down by more than 20% from their all-time highs, yet most of the products they sell are either exempt from President Trump's tariffs or were never impacted to begin with.\nIt's been a rough start to 2025, with the S&P 500 having its worst quarter since 2022 followed by escalating trade tensions in April.  Investors looking for broad-based exposure to the utilities sector might want to consider an exchange-traded fund (ETF) like the Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEMKT: VPU).

This change lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.17%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.39%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.05%.\nThe maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's shares have seen a decrease of 5.36% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 6.26% and falling behind the S&P 500's loss of 3.94%.\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Apple in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on May 1, 2025. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.60, showcasing a 4.58% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $93.5 billion, up 3.03% from the prior-year quarter.\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $7.20 per share and a revenue of $404.46 billion, demonstrating changes of +6.67% and +3.43%, respectively, from the preceding year.\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Apple. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.85% lower. Apple is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nInvestors should also note Apple's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 28.12.

The company offers a growing list of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that allow you to invest broadly in the stock market or focus on specific themes or types of stocks. \nOne of its many funds is the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG -1.51%). It's one of the smartest funds to buy because it tracks the performance of companies that grow their dividends. Historically, dividend growth stocks have delivered the highest total returns with the lowest risk. That makes this a great fund to buy and hold for 20 years to grow your wealth. \nThe Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF aims to track the performance of the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index. The managers of that index designed it to measure the performance of U.S. companies that have consistently increased their dividends for at least the past 10 years. Of note, it excludes the top 25% highest-yielding dividend stocks because these companies typically have higher dividend payout ratios and lower growth profiles. Those characteristics put them at a higher risk of stopping growth or reducing their dividends in the future. \nThe ETF's focus on companies that grow their dividends and are at lower risk for a future reduction is worth noting, given the data on dividend stocks by their policies: \nDividend Policy\nAverage Annual Total Returns\nDividend growers and initiators\n10.2%\nDividend payers\n9.2%\nNo change in dividend policy\n6.8%\nDividend cutters and eliminators\n(0.9%)\nDividend non-payers\n4.3%\nEqual-weighted S&P 500 index\n7.7%\nData sources: Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds. \nAs that table shows, dividend growers have produced the best returns among dividend stocks by policy while also significantly outperforming non-dividend-payers. \nThe ETF has delivered similarly strong returns throughout its history. Since its inception in 2006, the ETF has produced a 9.6% annualized return. Meanwhile, its return over the past 10 years is 11.3%. To put that into perspective, $2,000 invested into the fund at its inception nearly 20 years ago would have grown into about $12,500 today at a 9.6% average annual return. \nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nThe Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF currently holds 337 stocks. It has a higher weighting toward the biggest dividend growth stocks by market cap. Currently, the top 10 holdings comprise nearly 32% of its assets. \nHowever, these are the cream of the crop when it comes to dividend growth stocks. For example, the fund's top holding is tech titan Apple (AAPL -3.82%), at 4.9% of the fund. The company has increased its payout for 14 straight years while growing it at a nearly 8% annual rate over the past decade. While Apple currently offers a low dividend yield of 0.5%, that payout is extremely safe. Apple produced nearly $30 billion in cash from operating activities last quarter, easily covering its $3.8 billion dividend outlay. Meanwhile, with its earnings up 10% last quarter and growing, Apple should have no trouble continuing to increase its dividend in the future. \nApple is just one of the many high-quality dividend growth stocks among the fund's top 10 holdings. Other notable names are Visa, with 16 years of dividend increases; ExxonMobil, with 42 years of dividend growth; and Walmart, with 52 years of increasing its dividend. \nOne final thing to point out is that because the fund focuses on dividend growth and excludes higher-yielding dividend stocks, it has a lower dividend yield than some other dividend-focused ETFs: It recently yielded around 1.7%. However, the fund should still deliver attractive total returns in the future as the underlying companies grow their earnings and dividends, which should steadily increase their stock prices. \nDividend growth stocks have historically outperformed other dividend stocks and dividend non-payers over the long term. Given its focus on dividend growth stocks, buying the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is wise. The fund should deliver strong total returns over the decades, which should enable investors to meaningfully increase their wealth by buying and holding this fund. \n\n \n\nBefore you buy shares in the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF wasn’t one of them.

Digital platforms would bear the brunt, realizing $29 billion less in ad spending, with TV facing a $12 billion shortfall.\nRead more: What is a recession, and how does it impact you?\nEven before the Trump administration's April 2 announcement of a 10% baseline tariff on nearly all foreign imports, MoffettNathanson said companies were already in wait-and-see mode, holding back ad spending while trade policy remained unclear.\nRead more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\nIt's a stark reversal from the significant spending rebound the advertising industry enjoyed in 2024 on the back of record political spending, a booming economy, and lingering momentum from the post-pandemic digital and e-commerce boom.\nBut as MoffettNathanson argued, the tone has shifted from \"softly pessimistic\" to \"significantly more bearish.\"\n\"The shift is driven largely by the current administration's unorthodox and aggressive approach to addressing 'unfair' trade practices,\" the analysts said. \"The heightened uncertainty following the tariff announcement has led us to adopt a more cautious outlook for advertising.\"\nCompanies heavily reliant on advertising — like Meta (META), Snap (SNAP), and the Trade Desk (TTD) — would be hit \"disproportionately harder,\" with projected stock declines of at least 30% each, the firm estimates.\nDigital players with variable cost structures and less reliance on advertising, like Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), are \"better positioned to weather the storm.\"\nMeanwhile, connected TV player Roku (ROKU) would see the biggest relative impact, flipping from positive earnings in 2024 to a net loss in both 2025 and 2026, according to MoffettNathanson's projections.\nParamount could also reverse recent positive earnings trends, and other traditional media names like Disney (DIS), Fox (FOX), and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) would likely see earnings per share (EPS) declines of around 20% to 25%.\nAs earnings season kicks off, some clarity on the outlook may emerge. But if a US recession takes hold, a drop in ad spending could send lasting ripple effects across a broad spectrum of companies, regardless of their size.\nAs a UBS analyst said in a separate client note sent Tuesday: \"Advertising is usually the first to go in an economic downturn as companies look to cut expenses.\"\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nThe Trump administration plans to eliminate the IRS' Direct File program, an electronic system for filing tax returns directly to the agency for free, according to two people familiar with the decision.

Despite a recent rebound, shares trade ~30% below their 52-week highs, with the decline somewhat justified. Indeed, higher costs and global trade tensions could dent the company’s near-term prospects. Still, the effort to restore chip manufacturing to U.S. soil promises a lucrative payoff in the long run. Given this narrative and AMAT’s unmatched role in chip production, I’m bullish on the stock.\nDiscover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks.\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using  Tipranks' Stock Screener.\nEven with a 90-day tariff pause on semiconductors and electronics announced last Friday, it’s clear that Applied Materials faces choppy waters. The remaining 10% global tariff hike will undoubtedly damage chipmakers like Intel (INTC) and TSMC (TSM), who depend on imported wafers, gases, and components. This will squeeze their budgets, potentially freezing orders for AMAT’s high-end tools.\nTake its $20 million etching systems, for instance, or its deposition chambers, critical for cutting-edge chips. China’s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods further threaten AMAT’s foothold in a market that, for context, accounted for 30% of last year’s $26.5 billion in revenue.\nThe uncertainty is already biting. A single delayed fab can wipe out $500 million in AMAT orders, and with Asian chipmakers like Samsung rethinking expansion amid tariff chaos, you can see why the market might think that AMAT’s multi-billion-dollar backlog risks stalling. And then you have a story about Trump’s looming semiconductor-specific tariffs, which the market expects to hit within months. Undoubtedly, they keep customers jittery, as they are reluctant to greenlight projects when costs could spike overnight. It’s like a waiting game where hesitation makes more sense than action, leaving AMAT to tread carefully through a murky year.\nIf AMAT’s outlook wasn’t already wobbly, the company’s supply chain isn’t immune. Tariffs on niche materials, like high-purity silicon or rare-earth metals, could inflate costs, forcing the company to either absorb the hit or pass it on, risking customer pushback. So, for now, AMAT stock is facing pressure on multiple fronts.\nDespite the potential headwinds I just mentioned, investors should keep their minds open and consider that a bullish case might be hiding in the shadows. If Trump’s dream of a U.S. chipmaking renaissance pans out, maybe, just maybe, Applied Materials could be the golden goose. Tariffs are designed to lure chipmakers to American soil, and AMAT, the king of deposition and etching tools, is primed to cash in.\nNew fabs in places like Ohio or Arizona would devour AMAT’s machines, each plant potentially funneling $1 billion in orders for systems that layer and sculpt chips for AI, EVs, and defense. The CHIPS Act’s $52 billion war chest already greases the wheels, and tariffs could kneecap foreign rivals like ASML (ASML), whose scanners might face a looming 20% import tax with further increases on the table.\nBeyond fab construction, AMAT is also poised to ride the wave of state-of-the-art packaging and AI chip demand. Tariffs will likely incentivize U.S. production of complex chipsets, including Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPUs or Apple’s (AAPL) M-series, requiring AMAT’s advanced 3D stacking and hybrid bonding tools.\nIndustry projections suggest advanced packaging revenue could hit $79 billion by 2034. AMAT’s early lead in this niche could drive billions in orders as domestic firms like Intel scale up to compete globally. If tariffs lock in this shift, AMAT’s role as a tech enabler makes it a leader in America’s chip revival.\nAfter last week’s selloff, Applied Materials’ stock seems compelling, especially assuming the bullish case plays out. Down 30% from its 52-week peak, the stock trades at about 15x forward earnings. Analysts have trimmed their forecasts, yet AMAT is still set to churn out $6 billion in free cash flow this year, which is not too bad compared to last year’s ~$7 billion, considering the circumstances.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes.\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer reacted to the partial tariff exemptions announced by the White House, interpreting them not as a full retreat, but as a strategic pause designed to avoid punishing American companies. He suggested the administration was being careful not to hand over competitive advantages to Southeast Asian rivals, particularly Samsung:\n“So what I saw today, and not to be facetious, but what I see is people saying, you know what, we’ve seen the downside. Maybe we can test it again. But the president has, I don’t want to say blink, because that’s nonsense. What the president did was say, OK, look, we’re not going to continue to punish American companies and give the green light to Korea. I don’t know if you heard Lutnick’s words. He was very specific. Southeast Asia. That’s Samsung. They didn’t want to give the ball to Samsung.”\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Hints at a Bigger Agenda Behind Tariffs and Breaks Down These 7 Stocks and Jim Cramer Reacts to the Surprise Market Surge and Highlights 8 Key Stocks.\nTurning to currency dynamics, Cramer pushed back on what he sees as misplaced panic over a weakening U.S. dollar. Instead, he argued that a softer dollar actually benefits American multinationals and gives long-needed relief to CFOs who’ve spent years blaming currency strength for lost market share:\n“Well, look, I’m not so certain I’m going to do a little contrary stuff on the dollar here. When we listen to conference calls, for the last four years, all we hear about is it would have been so much better if the dollar weren’t so strong. We keep losing share, the dollar’s too strong. Suddenly the dollar’s weaker, and now we start hearing all the downside, what, the bonds? I mean, I’m almost thinking that, I’m gonna put this out there, the people who are saying that it’s the end of the world, that the dollar is weaker, I think they have to go do some work boots on the ground. […] So suddenly the dollar’s weaker and we are petrified? These are people who have an agenda. And their agenda is to say, you know what matters more than anything else? Our hegemony from a strong dollar. And I don’t get it. If you’re in our business of picking stocks, you’re sick and tired of hearing CFOs say, we are done. We’ve got to stop this dollar rise.”\nCramer also gave his opinion about the rhetoric coming from Beijing, likening it to the Cold War-era paranoia of the 1960s and ’70s. He questioned whether a diplomatic breakthrough similar to Nixon’s historic visit to China is even possible under the current tone of U.S.-China relations:\n“But when I listen to the rhetoric from China, this is the 1968-72 rhetoric. It’s the kind of rhetoric that just says there’s never going to be a meeting. Is there a way to have a Nixon to China moment? Because as far as I’m concerned, this is just right now you’re on the verge of when I was a little boy and we kept thinking, when are they going to bomb us? I mean, that was the same rhetoric. When are they going to launch their nuclear weapons? I mean, that’s why we used to live in fear. That’s why we had cubbyholes. That’s why we used to put our heads in a cubbyhole, because the Chinese were going to bomb us if the Russians didn’t bomb us. This is the same sound.”\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on April 14th.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund holders: 166\nJim Cramer spoke extensively about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the context of escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and the existential threat tariffs pose to the company’s supply chain and margin structure. He emphasized how vulnerable Apple is compared to competitors like Samsung, especially when government policies appear to be more favorable to foreign players. Here is what he had to say:\n“Look, I can’t tell what really happened with Apple, other than the fact that if you wanted to take Apple down, you’d keep doing what they were doing. And the reason I say that, very specifically, is because Apple is a loser to Samsung. […]\nA day earlier, Jim Cramer analyzed some of the risks that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) faces with the current regime. Here’s what he said last time:\n“And I think that one of the things that’s happening is that people are just saying, look, it’s too crazy. I mean, Apple was up. Now, I could argue that Apple shouldn’t have ever been up, but Apple’s come down. There’s a sense that, like, OK, this thing may be for real. And if it’s real, then how can you own Apple? Why not go buy Samsung?\nOverall, AAPL ranks 10th on our list of key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

We are watching Nvidia, Apple, and Wall Street banks. First up, several Wall Street firms cutting their price targets on Nvidia stock after the chip maker disclosed that it anticipates a $5.5 billion charge from new chip curbs. The US government told Nvidia earlier this month it would need a special license to export certain chips to China. Analysts at BFA Global Research, Piper Sandler, and Raymond James all lowering their price targets on the news. And also, Steve, what I also thought was really interesting here is an analyst over at City talking about how it's not just about Nvidia. This could also impact Broadcom. This could also impact other chip names in the space.\nWell, you're seeing them, you're seeing them sell off today. I mean, you know, AMD announced an $800 million charge along in there. Um, you know, Broadcom was trading lower this morning as well. ASML was trading lower, although they released earnings, but, but they're all, they're all part and parcel of this. This is not good news for the chip sector, because, you know, I, I don't mean to just sound like a broken record, but this is uncertainty, and uncertainty, the markets don't love uncertainty.\nWell, speaking, speaking of uncertainty, let's get to another name we're looking at. Apple's main suppliers in India shipping roughly $2 billion worth of iPhones in March ahead of President Trump's reciprocal tariffs announcement. That is according to new customs data. Smartphones have since secured a temporary reprieve from tariffs, but persistent tensions between the US and China threaten the iPhone maker's China-focused supply chain in the longer term. The Wall Street Journal reporting Apple is investigating moving some iPhone production to the US, but the process could take years, and CEO Tim Cook has said in the past that it would be difficult to find the skilled labor in America that's needed to build the smartphones. Treasury Secretary Scott Beson dismissed that comment and concern in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\nYou don't need a PhD in mechanical engineering to assemble an iPhone. So, I, I'm not sure why Tim Cook says that the skills aren't here.\nAnd Steve, I think what analysts who cover Apple might say and investors might say is that that skilled labor does take years to build up, and it's certainly something that allows Apple to turn out these iPhones incredibly quickly.\nWell, that's it. I mean, every, you know, labor now is not just, you know, pounding a hammer or nail. There, there's, there's, there's intricacies in the supply chain. You know, I, I know that, you know, the commerce secretary with his comment, you know, we're going to have lots of people screwing tiny little screws into things. That's not what people really want. You know, we want the high-tech value-added manufacturing because, quite frankly, our cost basis is higher. So, if there's value-added stuff to be done, that's great. If it's just, if it's just bringing low-skilled labor, bringing back low-skilled jobs, that's not necessarily, you know, I understand the need for that, particularly maybe in some strategic industries, but overall, I think we want people bringing a skill set to it. You know, I saw a statistic, this was posted on, on, on Twitter by my friend Frank Luntz who I trust. Um, and he got the statistics from the Cato Institute. 80% of the people when asked, said, do you want more manufacturing in the US? 80% said yes. When asked, would you take a factory job? 75% said no. 23% said yes. The other two said I already have a factory job. So, it, it's, you know, it's one of these, it's nice in theory, but in practice, um, you know, you need skilled, the people who are going to take these jobs, by definition, are really going to be skilled labor. Not, not just, you know, people, not just, you know, automatons screwing in screws.\nYeah. Right. The price that they're requiring for their labor requires it to be skilled. All right. Finally, trading desks at some of the biggest names in banking crashed in, cashed in, rather, on market volatility in the most recent quarter. And that is not including the past two weeks, which fell outside of that reporting period. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Goldman, all seeing record equity trading revenue during the quarter. Despite the blockbuster results, executives did express some caution about the current macro backdrop. JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon warning of considerable turbulence roiling the US economy. Well, Goldman's David Solomon said the prospects of a recession had increased. You couldn't pay Solomon to mention the word tariffs, but he did semi-maybe allude to it in that comment. Is this trading revenue for banks a signal of strength in your view, Steve? Or is this something that can kind of hide any economic macro concerns?\nKind of the latter. You know, I remember I spent the bulk of my career as an option trader, and I used, I loved environments like this. Um, you know, and to Jamie Dimon's comment, you know, about turbulence, you know, I always described VIX as sort of the price of a parachute when the plane hits turbulence at some level. You know, people want that protection. But here's what happens during volatility with, if you're an active trader. You widen your spreads, you shrink your sizes. So, effectively that really impairs liquidity, but if you're the person trading off those bid offs, bid-ask spreads, each trade you do is more profitable. And so, yes, that leads to the trading desks making more money, but really, you know, analysts typically discount that over time. It's actually a little odd this quarter that the analysts are very happy that the banks are making all this money trading because for years, again, as a trader at a publicly traded firm, the analysts were always very dismissive when we had a good quarter.\nYeah. Right, right, because it's potentially not a sign of continued gains for, for the banks. Steve, thank you so much for sticking with us.

But there's little chance companies like Apple (AAPL) will reinvent their supply chains before Trump leaves office in 2028.\nThe Trump administration hit China with a whopping 145% tariff on Chinese-made goods before announcing exemptions for tech devices ranging from smartphones to laptops on Friday. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during an interview with Jonathan Karl of ABC News on Sunday that the move was temporary and only applied to Trump's reciprocal tariffs.\nInstead, he explained, tech products will be tariffed as part of the administration's planned duties on semiconductors, which could be announced later this week.\nStill, even the threat of sky-high tariffs won't be enough to force tech giants like Apple to pick up and move their suppliers to the US en masse.\nRead more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\n\"Anything is possible, but the setup of smartphone production in India has been a three-year process from site identification through ramped-up production, with at least another two years to achieve full supply chain integration,\" Chris Rogers, head of supply chain research at S&P Global Market Intelligence, told Yahoo Finance.\nIt's not just about timing. Companies would also need the workers to build devices.\n\"While there's a degree of automation possible and while many of the components needed are made in the US, there's still a need for tens of thousands of trained electronics assemblers willing to work long, arduous hours in highly repetitive tasks,\" he added.\nCompanies including Nvidia (NVDA), TSMC (TSM), Apple, and others have announced increased investments in the US to win over Trump and avoid tariffs. On Monday, Nvidia said it will produce $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years through partners including Foxconn (601138.SS), TSMC, and Wistron (3231.TW).\nApple also said it will spend $500 billion, and TSMC has said it will spend $165 billion. Many of those plans, however, were already in the works or don't necessarily go above prior spending levels. Nvidia, for example, talked up building chips in the US last year.\nAnd while that doesn't take away from the fact that the companies are pouring money into the US, it doesn't exactly support the idea that they're moving vast amounts of their manufacturing capabilities to America.\n\"We believe hardware companies will remain focused on accelerating US-bound product assembly out of China, and see India and Mexico as the most-likely incremental beneficiaries of these actions (we'd argue Vietnam and Mexico have been the biggest beneficiaries over the last 5 years),\" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in an investor note.\n\"We just don't see large volume hardware production ever reaching US shores — these plans take years to devise, the costs (capex and opex) associated with manufacturing hundreds of millions of products annually in the US are high, and most importantly, tariff exemptions on finished goods disincentivize on-shoring (and is why we didn't see onshoring after President Trump's first administration),\" he added\nEven if companies brought their manufacturing bases to the US, they'd still have to deal with a host of headwinds ranging from worker salaries to the need to continue importing certain parts from abroad.\nAccording to Bank of America's Wamsi Mohan, while Apple may be able to find enough laborers in the US to build its iPhones, importing the company's entire supply chain will still take some time.\n\"This is because, while it may be possible to move final assembly to the US, moving the entire iPhone supply chain would be a much bigger undertaking and would likely take many years, if even possible.\"\nIt's not just Apple that's contending with these issues. Everything from laptop makers to display producers would face the same problems if they were to move to the US. That doesn't even take into account the potential price increases associated with manufacturing tech products in the US.\nAccording to some estimates, prices on devices could jump by hundreds of dollars, resulting in demand destruction as consumers seek out less expensive options or hold onto their existing smartphones and computers for longer periods.\nWhile it's unlikely manufacturing is coming back to the US, there's still plenty of uncertainty about how tech companies and consumers navigate the next four years of tariff shocks.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025.\nOn April 4, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives appeared on CNBC to discuss the potential impact of current tariffs and compared the situation to an economic armageddon. If the current tariffs remain in place, Ives thinks it would lead to a 15% to 20% demand reduction across the board. He thinks that investor anxiety is much higher considering how things were in the March 2020 COVID-19 crash earlier. The analyst thinks that investors should now focus on the likelihood of tariff adjustments from comments about negotiations, the impact on consumer-focused companies, and the potential for demand destruction. He even thinks that companies may refuse to provide guidance in the first-quarter earnings calls due to the persistent tariff uncertainty.\nIves thinks that a lot of tech companies will not be able to absorb high tariff increases and rather this cost will be passed on to the consumers which will lead to significant margin erosion and even potential sales declines. He indicated that tech stocks are currently pricing in a 10% to 15% cut to numbers. He suggests that investors should now look at companies with strong long-term potential as he believes earnings may normalize in 2025 and 2026. The analyst also addressed the defensive performance of defense contractors. While acknowledging the relative stability here, Ives cautioned that even these even such sectors are not immune to tariffs. He noted the significant foreign component, specifically 40% to 50% in some instances, in hardware and other sectors.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through the financial media reports to compile a list of the top NASDAQ stocks to buy for 2025. We then selected the 13 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 166\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs and manufactures smart devices. It offers smartphones under the iPhone line, personal computers under the Mac line, and multi-purpose tablets, under the iPad line. It also offers other accessories and wearables, like the AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, and HomePod. It also offers AppleCare support and cloud services.\nErik Woodring from Morgan Stanley lowered his iPhone shipment estimates for 2025-2026 by 1% to 5% because of delayed releases at the company. This is because of quality issues and malfunction rates that exceed 80%. Since June 2024, many features planned for release in April with iOS 18.4 2025 have been postponed. The company now aims to fix these issues by 2026, but the investors are already concerned about the competitiveness of its AI development.\nWoodring has also reduced his price target on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $275 to $252 due to the lack of an AI-driven iPhone upgrade cycle. The company is generally best known for its iPhone product cycle, with 52% of its revenue coming from this product line. The company has over 2.2 billion devices on sale and the next target is now to integrate AI for strengthening these service offerings.\nColumbia Seligman Global Technology Fund is optimistic about the company due to iPhone 17’s AI potential. It stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n“The fund maintained a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) throughout the quarter through the release of the company’s new iPhone 16 in September. Company leaders were excited about the release of the new model, as this is the first model that will feature enhanced AI capabilities through the Apple Intelligence features. Sales for the first few weeks in October and November trailed behind year over year sales from the iPhone 15, as availability of Apple Intelligence was not compatible with all iPhone models. Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI that has allowed the integration of ChatGPT into the Apple ecosystem, separate from the core Apple Intelligence features. This partnership highlights continued progress from Apple to introduce AI capabilities into its products and we expect the iPhone 17 to have even more expansive AI capabilities, increasing potential demand for the new model that is on track to be released in 2025.”\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy so far in 2025. While we acknowledge the growth potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Title: ‘It’s going to be the small stuff’_ Trump’s tariffs could make cheap tech gadgets not so cheap\nDate: 2025-04-16 15:30\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/tech/trump-tariffs-china-tech-products-price?.tsrc=rss\nContent:\nMarkets \n\n\n\nHot Stocks \n\n\n\nFear & Greed Index \n\n\n\n\n            Latest Market News \n\n\n\n\n            Hot Stocks \n\n\n\nFollow:\n\n            Those shopping for a new smartphone or computer may be spared from tariff-induced sticker shock. At least, for now.\n    \n\n            President Donald Trump issued a memorandum on April 11 saying certain electronics — including computers, smartphones and some components — won’t be subject to the reciprocal tariffs imposed on imports from China. While tariffs on virtually all other products from China are now at least 145%, prices of smartphones and certain other devices should avoid completely skyrocketing, at least for a little while.\n    \n\n            But with comments from the Trump administration indicating an upcoming wave of tariffs on semiconductors — a critical part of the chips that power electronic devices — it’s still unclear if and when tech products could get more expensive in the US. Plus, the current exclusions aren’t expected to cover many everyday tech products that consumers are likely to buy more frequently than new phones — such as some charging cables and earbuds.\n    \n\n            That makes it challenging for shoppers to know what to expect, but also for tech companies to adjust their supply chains and shipments as demand potentially fluctuates due to tariff-induced price swings — all while keeping prices reasonable.\n    \n\n            “It’s completely impossible for any company to plan,” said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president of client devices for the International Data Corporation, a firm that tracks global shipments of tech devices. “So the best, the only thing they can do at the moment is… ship as many products as they can while the exemption lasts to the US.”\n    \n\n            Some reports indicate that companies may be doing just that. Apple’s India-based suppliers shipped a record number of iPhones to the US in March, nearly $2 billion worth, according to Reuters. PC shipments grew by 12.6% in the US during the first quarter of 2025 as vendors increased shipments ahead of potential tariffs, market research firm Gartner said in a press release Monday.\n    \n\n            The exception is a major win for Apple, which relies on iPhone sales for most of its revenue — about $69 billion of its roughly $124 billion in its first fiscal quarter of 2025 — and has much of its smartphone supply chain located in China. But the Trump administration has indicated that more tech tariffs are coming.\n    \n\n            Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Sunday that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” when it comes to tariffs, adding that “there was no tariff exception” announced and these products are still subject to a 20% tariff on Chinese imports.\n    \n\n            The excepted products will be moved to a “different tariff bucket” as the administration examines the “whole electronics supply chain,” the post said. The Trump administration on Monday began investigating semiconductor imports to set the stage for tariffs.\n    \n\n            Kevin Hassett, national economic council director, said when speaking with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday that “it was always the case” that semiconductors would be covered under a separate action rather than reciprocal tariffs.  \n\n\n            The exception came after Trump’s tariff policies resulted in a whirlwind couple of weeks for the stock market, with the S&P 500 having its worst week since 2020 earlier this month.\n    \n\n            But the stock market saw massive gains last week when Trump announced a 90-day pause on most reciprocal tariffs, a sign that investors were seeking a reprieve from his levies.\n    \n\n            The exclusions specifically mention smartphones, computers (described as “automatic data processing machines”), monitors, storage devices and various components that power those devices, including integrated circuits and transistors.\n    \n\n            But a host of other tech products don’t appear to be included in the exceptions, such as USB charging cables, portable battery packs, headphones and video game consoles, a public affairs officer for the US International Trade Commission said in response to a CNN inquiry about whether these products fall under the exceptions.\n    \n\n            But it’ll likely depend on which components are inside these devices and how they’re categorized.\n    \n\n            The US ITC also said computer mice and keyboards are covered under the exceptions, but added that US Customs and Border Protection has the final say on how imported goods are classified and whether they’re exempted from tariffs.\n    \n\n            “It’s a gray area,” said Dave Marcotte, a senior vice president and analyst with market research and consultancy firm Kantar. “This is where you get creative about describing your products when you move to Customs. If you look at the scheduling and say, ‘Okay, well, I have, I have peripherals. Are peripherals covered? Or (are) computer cables covered?’ Well, they’re the same thing.”\n    \n\n            Even before Trump specified these exclusions, some analysts had expected smaller items like charging cables and headphones to be among those most heavily impacted by tariffs.\n    \n\n            “I think the first things you’re going to see (are) the stuff we don’t really pay attention to, like… USB chargers and batteries and stuff that’s less than, say, $20, $25,” Marcotte said last week ahead of Trump’s exception on smartphones and other select tech products. “It’s going to be the small stuff.”\n    \n\n            Smaller companies don’t have the supply chain flexibility of a stalwart like Apple, for example, and the margins on cheaper items such as charging cables are much lower. That means these firms don’t have as much flexibility to absorb additional tariff costs and would likely have to pass it down to consumers to turn a profit.\n    \n\n            And many of these ancillary tech gadgets appear to be from China.\n    \n\n            When CNN searched Amazon for earbuds under $50, iPhone charging cables and portable battery packs, many of the top five results for each product either had China listed as the country of origin, or mentioned a manufacturer based in China. Some of the results didn’t name a country of origin, but other product pages from the same sellers listed products as coming from China.\n    \n\n            Trump also got rid of the “de minimis exemption,” which allowed packages valued at less than $800 to enter the US tax-free — another change that’s expected to impact the prices cheap goods from China.\n    \n\n            Price hikes on these smaller, cheaper items could feel more impactful to consumers in some cases since the difference in price may feel more drastic.\n    \n\n            “A $40 increase to an $80 increase looks a lot worse for a consumer than, say, a $1,200 to $1,500,” said Jack Leathem, an analyst at market research firm Canalys.\n    \n\n            Although some tech products got a break on certain reciprocal levies, new tariffs on semiconductors are expected to arrive in the “next month or two,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told ABC News on Sunday. It’s part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to reduce US reliance on China while reshoring manufacturing.\n    \n\n            But tariffs or not, the chances of an American-made iPhone seem slim. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump believes iPhone production could move to the US, but higher labor costs and the logistics of shifting Apple’s massive production network to the other side of the world — further away from Asia, where many components would likely still be sourced — present major challenges.\n    \n\n            And it’s not just the components. Finding workers would be an issue, too.\n    \n\n            “It’s very hard to find skilled labor in the numbers they need,” Jeronimo said.\n    \n\n            Apple in February announced a $500 billion investment to expand its US operations. But that commitment is largely focused on building production facilities for Apple Intelligence servers and boosting education in manufacturing, not building iPhones. And while several tech leaders like chipmaking giants TSMC and Nvidia have announced major US expansions, the tech supply chain is largely expected to remain in China, says Jeronimo.\n    \n\n            Companies are more likely to shift some production to other regions, like the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, according to Jeronimo.\n    \n\n            Trump’s tariff policy is already seems to be impacting some tech product launches and shipments. The US smartphone market grew more than 5% in the first quarter of 2025, according to the IDC, partially driven by a “sense of urgency to buy before potential price increases,” the IDC’s research director for client devices Anthony Scarsella said in a Monday press release.\n    \n\n            Nintendo also postponed US preorders for its new Switch 2 game console in early April as it assesses the tariff situation.\n    \n\n            “You stockpile during a hurricane because it happens for five days,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, vice president and principal analyst at market research firm Forrester. “There is no pantry in the world that’s large enough where you can stockpile four years’ worth of trade policy uncertainty.”\n    \nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, which is now based in Singapore, said in separate but nearly identical notices that their operating expenses have gone up “due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs.”  Both companies said they would be making “price adjustments” starting April 25, although neither provided details about the size of the increases.\nTSMC, the main global producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is set to report a 57% leap in first-quarter profit on Thursday, though it is also likely to flag risks from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies.

The dollar tumbled last week on concerns over the economic impact of new tariffs and as investors shifted allocations overseas due to uncertainty on the erratic implementation of the trade levies.  The United States is in discussions with countries including Japan, while tensions between China and the U.S. are intensifying.\nNvidia stock sank after a surprise disclosure it would take a hit north of $5 billion following new chip export restrictions.\n(Reuters) -The ripple effects of Donald Trump's global trade war are increasingly being felt across numerous industries all at once and on Wednesday were once again exerting pressure on U.S. stock markets that have been roiled for weeks by his erratic trade policies.  Stocks fell broadly, with tech stocks hit particularly hard after bellwethers like Nvidia that are highly tied into the world's supply chain warned of hits to their bottom line.  Meanwhile, airlines said they are bracing for an uncertain summer travel season, and the head of the Federal Reserve noted slowing economic activity - but also cast a wary eye on the threat that tariffs pose to its goal of lowering inflation.\nTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results\nSign in to access your portfolio\n\n\n\nTry again."

Attempts to reorient global trade through tariffs and export curbs have started to show the effect as Nvidia warned of a $5.5 billion hit after Washington restricted exports of its AI processor tailored for China, while Dutch chip-making tools giant ASML raised doubts about its outlook.  The U.S. restriction, which also hit the MI308 processor of Advanced Micro Devices, marked the latest blow for the AI chip trade that is losing steam after a two-year rally as tariff threats and fears over Big Tech's spending weigh on sentiment.\nNetflix is slated to report first-quarter results after markets close Thursday, and options markets suggest traders are expecting a stock price big move in the following days.\nWe recently published a list of 13 Best NASDAQ Stocks to Buy So Far in 2025.

Seeking to explain messages in which he worried that Instagram was a competitive threat, Zuckerberg said the app's camera was simply better than camera features Meta had developed.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized in federal court on Wednesday that he bought Instagram and WhatsApp because he saw value in the companies — not to take out competitors, as the Federal Trade Commission alleges in a historic antitrust trial.  Zuckerberg took the stand for the third day in the trial, wrapping up his testimony as the first witness Wednesday afternoon.  Hansen focused some of his questioning on emails sent by Zuckerberg and his associates that the FTC cited in earlier testimony to illustrate the Facebook founder's alarm over the growth of Instagram and his sense that he needed to neutralize its threat.\nWith President Donald Trump announcing a wide set of tariffs, there could be increased costs for a range of companies.

World stocks fell into a downward spiral on Wednesday led by tech losses after Washington said it is putting new curbs on AI chip exports to China, marking an escalation in the global trade war.\nThe Trump administration's latest broadside sparked huge demand for safe-haven assets like gold, the Swiss franc and U.S. Treasuries, even though Fed Chair Jerome Powell signalled he is in no rush to cut interest rates.\nIf U.S. Big Tech had acquired a safe-haven status in the eyes of some investors in recent years, it is disappearing fast. More on that and more below, but first, a round-up of the day's main market moves. I'd love to hear from you, so please reach out to me with comments at . You can also follow me at @ReutersJamie and @reutersjamie.bsky.social.\nIf you have more time to read today, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets.\n1.

Will the damage done to Nvidia and others on Wednesday prompt a similar rethink?\nEconomic signals from China and the U.S. on Wednesday were surprisingly positive, with U.S. retail sales in March and first quarter Chinese GDP growth beating forecasts. But these are rear-view mirror indicators, and if anyone needed it, Wednesday's news is a reminder that the outlook is pretty bleak.\nEconomists at Morgan Stanley and UBS this week cut their Chinese 2025 GDP outlooks to 4.2% and 3.4%, respectively. Anything close to the UBS forecast would be particularly alarming for Beijing, which is targeting growth of around 5%.\nMorgan Stanley's economists estimate tariffs will knock 90 basis points off growth relative to their original forecast, which will only be partially offset by 60 bps of additional stimulus.\nAlthough U.S. growth is slowing, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled on Wednesday the central bank will wait for \"greater clarity\" before deciding its next move on rates. He also said markets have been orderly and downplayed the risk of Fed intervention.\nMassive selling of long-dated Treasuries last week raised fears that part of the bond market wasn't functioning smoothly. There was no sign of that on Wednesday, however, as bonds' 'safe haven' qualities pushed yields down as much as 5 basis points at the short end.\nIn Europe, eyes will turn to Frankfurt where the European Central Bank on Thursday will announce its latest policy decision and ECB President Christine Lagarde will offer her outlook. Market pricing suggests a 25 basis point cut is all but certain, with at least another two coming later this year.\nAnd after Wednesday's rout, the focus in Asia on Thursday will stay on tech as Taiwan's TSMC reports first-quarter earnings. The world's largest contract chipmaker is expected to report a 34.2% increase in revenue to $25.318 billion from $18.87 billion a year ago, according to the mean estimate from five analysts based on LSEG data.\nTech and tariffs - a potent mix which roiled markets on Wednesday and will likely do so again sooner rather than later.\nUS Big Tech swaps 'safe haven' sheen for trade war target\nTreasuries are not the only 'safe haven' U.S. asset getting the cold shoulder as investors around the world rethink their enthusiasm for all things America. The shadow over 'Big Tech' is darkening and lengthening too.\nIn recent weeks, the global trade war, the Trump administration's 'America First' agenda and its apparent disdain for the post-war world order have dramatically slowed inflows into U.S. markets, and in some cases, reversed them. What used to be considered some of the safest shelters from crisis are now looking a little flimsy.\nIt might seem a stretch to put shares of U.S. technology and chip companies, such as Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon, on par with IOUs of the federal government, but these cash-generating emblems of 'U.S. exceptionalism' certainly seemed like sure things up until recently.\nAs these firms' global dominance spread over the past decade and their market footprint reached an unprecedented size, they effectively become ATMs for shareholders, generating record profits running into the hundreds of billions of dollars.\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, the 'Magnificent Seven' - Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Tesla - accounted for a record 35% of the S&P 500's market cap, with a combined valuation of around $17.5 trillion. Credit ratings on some, like Apple, are the same as the U.S. sovereign rating, and yields have even traded below Treasury yields on occasion.\nInvestors of all stripes wanted in, from domestic to foreign, retail to official.\nAnd who could blame them? The 'Mag 7' appeared to offer the best of both investment worlds: a high income-generating asset and a safe-haven. So much so that the Swiss National Bank has a quarter of its $150 billion equity holdings in Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon, and half of the $1.8 trillion Norwegian wealth fund's record $222 billion profit last year came from U.S. tech.\nREALITY CHECK\nBut that sweet spot is gone. The 'American exceptionalism' narrative has been undermined, as the U.S. economy looks set to slow and America's AI invincibility has been shattered by China's DeepSeek. And now tech companies find themselves on the front line of the global trade war.\nWashington is issuing new export licensing requirements for Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China. Nvidia said it faces $5.5 billion in charges, and its shares tumbled 9% on Wednesday, wiping nearly $250 billion off its market value and dragging the broader semiconductor index down 4%.\nTo be sure, U.S. tech has been getting slammed since mid-February, as investors have begun to re-evaluate the sunny outlook they had for the industry under a Trump presidency. The semiconductor index is now deep in a bear market. It has lost 30% in just two months and valuations have come down much more than the wider S&P 500.\nU.S. Big Tech is suddenly vulnerable on multiple fronts. Tariffs and trade restrictions from Washington will bite, as will retaliatory moves from China. And if Europe really wants to hit America where it hurts, tech is an obvious target.\nWHAT GOES UP...\nBut it's also worth remembering how much Big Tech outperformed on the way up. They were - and remain - incredibly profitable. According to LSEG figures, the Mag 7's net profit margin hit a record 25.8% in the fourth quarter, nearly double the S&P 500's 13.4%.\nNvidia's value rose 10-fold in two years to more than $3.5 trillion, Mag 7 stocks more than doubled between October 2023 and last December, and these companies accounted for almost all of the market's profit growth in 2023.\nWhile that halved last year and is expected to decline further this year to around a third, there is still a lot of air left to come out of the balloon. According to Bank of America's latest global fund manager survey, 'long Mag 7' was the most crowded trade for 23 consecutive months until April.\nAnd what was it replaced with? Long gold, one 'safe haven' that isn't giving up its title.\nWhat could move markets tomorrow?\n* TSMC earnings (Q1) * Japan trade (March) * Bank of Korea interest rate decision * European Central Bank interest rate decision * Germany producer price inflation (March) * U.S. weekly jobless claims * U.S. 5-year TIPs auction * U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent meets Japan EconomyMinister Ryosei Akazawa\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best blue chip stocks to buy according to billionaires.\nThe US stock market is showing volatility after President Donald Trump’s recent announcement of sweeping 10% tariffs on all US trading partners and higher tariffs on countries with a trade deficit with the US.\nEconomists and investors believe President Trump’s tariff policies could potentially lead to a trade war with America’s trading partners, propelling inflation even higher. These two factors could plunge the US into an economic slowdown, and the markets could potentially sell off quickly if a recession materializes among its looming threats.\nOn April 10, CNBC reported that stock prices rose sharply a day before after declining for four days straight following President Trump’s announcement of a pause in a significant part of his tariff plan. The White House said that Democratic lawmakers were indulged in partisan games by inquiring if any stock market purchases conducted in recent days were undertaken with prior knowledge of the fact that President Trump would authorize a pause in his tariff plans. Trump announced higher tariffs on China even after he announced a 90-day pause for steeper-than-baseline rates for several other countries.\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Medical Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires and 10 Best Organic Food Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires.\nOn April 11, Erica York, economist and the vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy, talked to CNBC’s “The Exchange” about the ongoing scenario and said that the imposition of around 145% total tariff on Chinese goods would result in a suspension of most trade between the US and China. She said:\n“It depends on how narrowly the tariff is applied or how broadly it’s applied, but generally, if you get north of a triple-digit tariff, you are cutting off most trade.”\nShe further opined that:\n“There may still be some things without any substitutes that companies just have to foot the bill, but for the most part, that cuts it off.”\nThe economist said that Trump’s new China tariffs, along with the others he implemented, would raise the average tariff rate to record highs the country hasn’t seen since the 1940s. The current market volatility has created numerous remarkable investment opportunities, so let’s look at the 15 best blue chip stocks to buy according to billionaires.\nWe reviewed financial media reports and ETFs to compile an initial list of blue chip stocks and selected stocks that have a 5-year revenue growth rate of at least 10%. We have also considered the popularity of these stocks among billionaire investors. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies. We also added the number of hedge fund holders for each stock as of fiscal Q4 2024, and sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey’s database.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and sells smartphones, personal computers, wearables, accessories, and related products and services worldwide. The company’s stock is facing turbulence and skepticism after Trump imposed 125% tariffs on China, which is where much of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) products come from.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring released a note on April 10, speculating that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could experience a $7 billion to $8 billion drop on next year’s iPhone sales even if the company manages to reroute around 60% of its production to India. The analyst maintained an overweight rating on the stock and set a one-year price target of $220 per share, based on the expectations that it would route around 50% of the tariff costs to suppliers, lowering the effect on its EPS.\nApart from these circumstances, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) holds a significant premium brand and market position, supported by highly in-demand hardware devices. It is also a financially sound company, generating a notable $36.3 billion in net income in fiscal Q1 2025, resulting in a sizable free cash flow. Analysts are bullish on the stock, and its median price target of $198.15 implies an upside of 26.17% from current levels.\nOverall, AAPL ranks 13th on our list of the best blue chip stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential for AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The messages, often between Zuckerberg and other top Meta executives, painted a picture of an executive who was paranoid about his rivals and willing to buy competitors whenever possible.\nThe FTC is seeking to force Meta to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that the two acquisitions have given Meta an illegal monopoly over parts of the social networking industry. Emails and documents presented at trial show that Meta, then called Facebook Inc., struggled to compete in the mobile app boom in the early 2010s, buying up successful competitors. The FTC said Meta bought the companies to eliminate direct competitive threats.\nMultiple Competitors\nZuckerberg and Meta’s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Meta faces a wide array of competitors that fight for user attention, including ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, Google’s YouTube, Apple Inc.’s iMessage and Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that TikTok, in particular, posed a “highly urgent” competitive threat when it sprang up in 2018.\n“We observed that our growth slowed down dramatically,” as TikTok gained popularity, Zuckerberg said Wednesday. “It was highly urgent, this has been a top priority for the company for several years.” Meta eventually rolled out a direct competitor, called Reels, that now drives a significant amount of video traffic for the company.\nZuckerberg was at times vague over his three days in court, and regularly disputed the FTC’s interpretations of his prior emails. As a leader, the way he communicated with staff was often blunt or harsh, and he spent time on the stand trying to add more nuance to what was written by his younger self. He occasionally clashed with the FTC’s lead lawyer, Daniel Matheson, who objected at one point that Zuckerberg wasn’t answering his questions.\nWhat’s unclear is how much weight those emails will ultimately have as US District Judge James Boasberg, who is presiding over the case, makes his decision. Meta has argued that the intent behind the purchases doesn’t matter, only whether those deals lead to consumer harm, which it disputes.\nBoasberg previously said the FTC will have a difficult time. Despite allowing the bulk of the case to proceed last November, Boasberg struck a skeptical tone about the FTC’s chances at trial. “Prevailing here, however, does not obscure the fact that the Commission faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial,” the judge said. “Indeed, its positions at times strain this country’s creaking antitrust precedents to their limits.”\nBoasberg also said in a ruling shortly before the trial that the FTC must prove Meta is harming competition in the present day.\nSheryl Sandberg, the company’s former chief operating officer, followed Zuckerberg on the witness stand, facing sharp questioning from FTC lawyer Susan Musser.\nIf the FTC prevails, a spinoff of Instagram and WhatsApp would undo years of integration between the apps, disrupt two of the most popular digital consumer products in the world and potentially erase hundreds of billions of dollars in Meta’s market value. It would also raise serious questions about how the government evaluates and approves deals because the government allowed the transactions to go through at the time.\n‘Network Effects’\nPart of the FTC’s case involves the technical concept of “network effects,” meaning that the more users a company like Meta has, the more likely they are to retain a dominant position, because people are unlikely to switch to a service used by few people.\nBoasberg has remained largely silent during the questioning, but interjected during Zuckerberg’s testimony Wednesday to ask if network effects still really matter.\n“How much does it matter if your friends are on a particular platform if you can send content out of that platform? Why does it matter if your friends are there?” the judge said.\nZuckerberg said it doesn’t. “These apps now serve primarily as discovery engines,” he said. “People can take that content to messaging engines.”\nBigger Company\nUnder questioning by Meta lawyer, Mark Hansen, Zuckerberg refuted the FTC’s argument that Meta bought Instagram to bury a competitor. Instagram would not likely have been able to grow to the extent it has had it remained independent, he said. “Instagram has been built out into a much more vibrant service” as a result of the deal, Zuckerberg said.\nTaking a small online platform to a billion users and beyond is unlikely to happen without the backing of a larger company, he said. “Every company that has this level of scale is owned by a bigger company,” he said, citing TikTok and YouTube as examples.\nEarlier in the trial, it was revealed that Snap Inc.’s Evan Spiegel turned down a $6 billion acquisition offer from Facebook in 2013 for its Snapchat app. Zuckerberg said that the app would have grown more rapidly had it joined his company.\nZuckerberg sought to walk back some statements that he made in previous internal communications. He acknowledged that he sent a 2013 email saying that Facebook blocked advertising for messaging apps WeChat, Kakao and Line, in which he wrote the apps were “trying to build social networks to replace us.” On the stand this week, however, he said “it’s hard for me to characterize what their intent was.”\nMatheson also sought to show that Meta was aware of its antitrust risk years ago, including a possible breakup.\nHe displayed an email from 2018 in which Zuckerberg suggested that Meta should consider spinning off Instagram into a standalone company. “As calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway,” he wrote.\nAt one point, Zuckerberg was asked by Hansen to describe how he was evaluating the competitive threat posed by Instagram and others at the time of the deals. He referenced a quote from former Intel Corp. CEO Andy Grove: “Only the paranoid survive.”\n(Updates with color on Zuckerberg testimony starting in the first paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nTrump's trade war is causing all sorts of extreme dislocations in market and economic sentiment.\n(Bloomberg) -- Shale fracker Liberty Energy Inc. posted its worst earnings in three years amid plunging oil prices and mounting concerns about energy demand.Most Read from BloombergTrump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office SpaceHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?Why the Best Bike Lanes Always Get BlamedLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal CostsDOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on LeaveAdjusted first-quarter profit fell to 4 cen\nEven in the midst of a sharp drop in his company’s stock price and a freight market that is not supporting the bottom line at Triumph Financial, CEO Aaron Graft touted milestones reached and signaled a new aggressiveness in pricing the company’s products.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank would wait for more data on the economy's direction before changing interest rates.  Speaking to the Economic Club of Chicago, he noted that there was a potentially tough situation developing for the Fed in which inflation is pushed higher by tariffs while growth and potentially, employment, weaken.\nChinese online marketplace Temu and fast-fashion retailer Shein, two of the biggest advertisers on U.S. social media, are sharply cutting their U.S. digital ad spending, industry data show, in a blow to tech companies such as Meta's Facebook and YouTube.  The online retailers, both of which ship low-priced China-made goods direct to U.S. shoppers, had been on an ad spree until recently, targeting younger, thriftier shoppers in digital media.  U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order earlier this month threatens this business.\nA federal judge’s decision, which stated agencies lacked authority to pause funding, follows the president’s executive order to freeze the money on his first day in office.\nChina-founded e-commerce sites Temu and Shein say they plan to raise prices for U.S. customers starting next week, a ripple effect from President Donald Trump's attempts to correct the trade imbalance between the world's two largest economies by imposing a sky-high tariff on goods shipped from China.  Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, which is now based in Singapore, said in separate but nearly identical notices that their operating expenses have gone up “due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs.”  Both companies said they would be making “price adjustments” starting April 25, although neither provided details about the size of the increases.\nAll is not lost when it comes to investing in Nvidia.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\nOn Friday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer outlined what investors should focus on in the week, especially pointing to earnings reports from major banks.\n“Rumor, innuendo, intrigue these are the stuff of great novels, of fabulous miniseries, riveting plays, and now they’re the stuff of the stock market.”\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks and 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently.\nHe noted the chaotic nature of the current environment and remarked that “this tape has it all,” and emphasized how unpredictable developments from the White House have added to the turbulence. Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes.\n“Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,” he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, “Except this isn’t an eight-part blockbuster, it’s our money.” Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday’s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic.\nCramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a “liberation day bottom,” a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, “Not sure, I’m just not sure.” He added:\n“Have you ever noticed the weekends don’t provide relaxation anymore because the president’s got advisors? He’s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He’s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime…. Monday’s trading, well, let’s just say that it looks like that it’s earning season so it’s gonna be even harder than usual.”\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 113\nCommenting on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) during the episode, Cramer said:\n“Tuesday, we hear from two more big banks and by this time, I gotta tell you, when we see the numbers from Bank of America and Citigroup, our eyes are going to glaze over. They shouldn’t but they will. I think that Bank of America will be the usual fine self and Citigroup’s gotten so loved that it’s probably going to roar no matter what is said, such is the admiration for CEO Jane Fraser and she certainly earned it.”\nBank of America (NYSE:BAC) is a long-standing financial institution. It offers services such as savings accounts, checking accounts, loans, investment management, and wealth planning. Hardman Johnston Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n“Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is the second largest bank in the developed world and operates the third largest branch network in the US. With 86% of revenues coming from the US, the bank is a clear beneficiary of the lower regulatory environment expected from the incoming administration. The company’s business is highly diversified across retail, commercial, wealth management, and investment banking, with significant scale across all verticals. Management believes there is a big opportunity going forward in growing and monetizing its mass retail client base. Wealth is another huge opportunity, with the Merrill Lynch platform enabling customers to make more transactions and purchase additional products. Lastly, Bank of America has an opportunity to increase efficiency through cost reduction and online banking. Our expectation is for the bank’s ROE to move significantly higher, driving EPS growth and higher multiples.”\nOverall, BAC ranks 3rd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of BAC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BAC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

Meantime, the European Union and US made scant progress bridging trade differences.\n“We would advise investors to avoid making hard and fast assumptions about how tariff developments will ultimately play out in the economy and on corporate profits,” said Anthony Saglimbene at Ameriprise. “Instead, we suggest investors prepare for a range of possible intermediate-term outcomes that include slow-to-positive economic and profit growth, and scenarios of slow-to-negative growth.”\nHigh uncertainty surrounding US trade policy and a spike in financial-market volatility has unsettled global investors over the past few weeks. Sentiment regarding economic prospects is the most negative in three decades, yet fund managers’ pessimism isn’t fully reflected in their asset allocation which could mean more losses for US stocks, a Bank of America Corp. survey shows.\nFund managers are “max bearish on macro, not quite max bearish on the market,” strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a note. “Peak fear” is not yet reflected in cash allocations, they added.\nSome of the main moves in markets:\nStocks\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.2% as of 4 p.m. New York time\nThe Nasdaq 100 rose 0.2%\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%\nThe MSCI World Index rose 0.1%\nBloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index fell 0.6%\nThe Russell 2000 Index rose 0.1%\nKBW Bank Index rose 1.2%\nCurrencies\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.3%\nThe euro fell 0.6% to $1.1284\nThe British pound rose 0.3% to $1.3228\nThe Japanese yen was little changed at 143.16 per dollar\nCryptocurrencies\nBitcoin fell 1% to $83,970.85\nEther fell 1.6% to $1,608.22\nBonds\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined four basis points to 4.33%\nGermany’s 10-year yield advanced two basis points to 2.53%\nBritain’s 10-year yield declined one basis point to 4.65%\nCommodities\nWest Texas Intermediate crude was little changed\nSpot gold rose 0.7% to $3,232.61 an ounce\n--With assistance from John Viljoen, Julien Ponthus and Anand Krishnamoorthy.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n(Bloomberg) -- Republicans in the White House, Senate and House are drafting analyses on how best to craft a new tax bracket for the wealthiest Americans, work that signals the GOP under President Donald Trump is seriously considering ideas to raise taxes on the rich.Most Read from BloombergHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?Trump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office SpaceLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs$15 Million Fund Bets Leadership Trai\nU.S.-traded shares of Ericsson jumped Tuesday after the Swedish telecommunications firm reported first-quarter profit that topped analysts’ expectations.\nAfter electronics, the administrative windfall is now shifting to autos.

Monitor these key levels on the weekly chart.\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Citigroup beat Wall Street estimates for first-quarter profit on Tuesday and moved closer to its profitability target as its traders reaped a windfall from volatile markets that fueled client activity.  The third-largest U.S. lender's earnings echoed those of Wall Street rivals, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley, whose results were also lifted by stronger equities trading.  While industry profits rose, executives warned that U.S. tariff policies cast a shadow over the economic outlook.\nTOKYO/OTTAWA (Reuters) -Honda said it has no plans to move car production from Canada and Mexico to the U.S., responding to a report that it might move operations in an effort to avoid potentially devastating tariffs.  \"No changes are being considered at this time,\" Honda Canada said in an emailed statement.  \"Honda has not made any production decisions that affect operations in Mexico, nor are any currently being considered,\" Honda Mexico said in an emailed statement.\nWith President Donald Trump announcing a wide set of tariffs, there could be increased costs for a range of companies.

Despite recent gains, all three major indices remain well below their pre-April 2 levels, when President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements first rattled markets.\nRead more: Wall Street banks are cashing in on trade war chaos.\nAuto stocks fell despite fresh rumors of a possible reprieve on tariffs. Ford, GM, and Rivian each ended the day lower, following a new forecast from S&P Global Ratings (SPGI) projecting a 700,000-unit drop in annual U.S. car sales if tariffs move ahead. “Affordability challenges and elevated interest rates are already pressuring demand,” analysts wrote. “Tariffs would only exacerbate those headwinds.”\nTech and financial names led the upside among individual stocks. Palantir surged more than 6% following news that NATO finalized its purchase of the company’s AI-powered Maven Smart System. Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 5% amid ongoing activist investor pressure, and Netflix (NFLX) added nearly 5%. Bank of America and Citigroup also posted solid gains after beating first-quarter earnings expectations, fueled by strong trading revenue and consumer banking results.\nInvestors are now looking ahead to fresh earnings from United Airlines (UAL) and The Trade Desk (TTD), both due after the bell, and to a Wednesday slate that includes Abbott Labs (ABT) and U.S. Bancorp (USB)—reports that should offer further insight into consumer health and the state of regional lending.\nStocks opened higher Tuesday, with tech and bank names leading the charge as investors welcomed a morning packed with strong earnings and fresh deal buzz. Big banks were in rally mode: Citigroup, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs all ticked higher after posting better-than-expected results, fueled by strong trading revenues.\nPalantir Technologies jumped 4% after NATO finalized its purchase of the company’s AI-powered Maven Smart System — another boost for the defense-tech darling after Monday’s rally. Apple also edged higher, extending its 2% gain from Monday, which followed a surprise tariff exemption from the Trump administration.\nMeanwhile, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) caught a wave of investor enthusiasm after activist firm Elliott Investment Management revealed a $1.5 billion stake and backed the company’s newly announced strategic review. The broader market got a lift as chipmakers, software stocks, and AI plays rode the wave, with early signs pointing to a tech-led session and plenty of earnings drama still to come.\nAuto stocks gave back some of Monday’s gains, with Rivian (RIVN), Ford, and GM trading lower despite President Trump floating a potential delay in auto tariffs. “A US car with all US parts made in the US is a fictional tale,” analysts at Wedbush wrote, warning that the proposed tariffs — if not paused — could send the industry into “upside down mode” and trigger widespread supply-chain disruption.\nU.S. stock futures edged down Tuesday morning, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average trading just below the break-even line as investors braced for a flurry of corporate earnings.\nThe subdued start followed a tech-driven rally on Monday, a temporary lift amid lingering concerns around tariffs and broader economic uncertainty.\nGoldman Sachs (GS) kicked off the week’s earnings slate with a profit jump, even as CEO David Solomon warned of a “markedly different” environment in the current quarter. Echoing Solomon’s sentiments, in March, hedge funds unloaded global stocks at the fastest pace in over a decade — a sign that institutional investors may be growing more cautious as economic uncertainty deepens.\nTuesday’s earnings lineup includes Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and Rent the Runway (RENT) before the bell, offering a pulse check across finance, healthcare, and consumer spending.\nBank of America beat expectations in the first quarter, with EPS of $0.90 on $27.37 billion in revenue, lifted by a strong showing in its trading division. Like Goldman Sachs, the bank benefited from market volatility, which juiced results even as the broader economic outlook remains uncertain.\nLooking to Bank of America’s consumer banking division, revenue rose 3% to $10.5 billion, with combined credit and debit card spend hitting $228 billion — up 4% from a year ago. The bank added about 250,000 new consumer checking accounts, marking its 25th straight quarter of growth, and saw 4 billion digital logins, with 65% of sales now digitally enabled.\nStill, CEO Brian Moynihan struck a cautious tone, noting that “we potentially face a changing economy in the future.”\nCitigroup posted first-quarter 2025 net income of $4.1 billion, or $1.96 per share, on $21.6 billion in revenue — a 3% increase from a year ago. Growth was broad-based across all five core businesses, with standout performances in the markets and wealth divisions.\nU.S. personal banking revenue rose 2% to $5.2 billion, powered by gains in branded cards and retail banking, though partially offset by a drop in retail services. Net interest income climbed 6%, fueled by loan growth in branded cards and wider deposit spreads in its retail banking.\nJohnson & Johnson beat Wall Street expectations in the first quarter, reporting adjusted earnings per share of $2.77 on revenue of $21.89 billion. Sales of cancer drug Darzalex jumped 20% year over year to $3.24 billion, helping drive 4.2% growth in the company’s “innovative medicine” segment.\nThe healthcare giant raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $91.6 billion and $92.4 billion, reflecting the impact of its Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition and the addition of Caplyta, a treatment for bipolar depression. However, adjusted EPS guidance held steady at $10.50 to $10.70 as the company factors in tariffs, deal-related costs, and currency headwinds.\nJ&J also moved to reverse $7 billion previously set aside for talc-related legal settlements, after courts rejected its bankruptcy-based strategy for resolving lawsuits over its discontinued baby powder. The company maintains the claims are without merit and says it will defend them in state courts.\nDuring a television appearance on Monday, former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that Trump’s economic strategy is eroding global trust in U.S. financial assets, with volatility in Treasury yields reflecting broad investor unease.\nTreasury yields continued to climb on Tuesday, with the 10-year yield reaching 4.43%, as investors reacted to ongoing trade tensions and concerns over inflation. The bond market’s volatility has raised questions about the long-term stability of U.S. financial assets.\nBoth the Dow and the S&P 500 added about 0.8% on Monday, while the Nasdaq climbed about 0.6%. All three indexes briefly slipped into the red before rebounding, buoyed by tech stocks after the Trump administration issued a surprise tariff exemption. Apple (AAPL) stock gained more than 2% on Monday, while Palantir Technologies (PLTR) surged almost 5% following news that NATO had finalized its Maven Smart System purchase.\nAuto stocks also rallied Monday after President Donald Trump suggested his administration may offer tariff relief for automakers moving parts production. General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) each rose more than 3%, though no specifics were provided.\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nBank stocks were on track for their largest increase in a week after Citi and Bank of America each reported first-quarter earnings that topped analysts’ expectations. On Tuesday the SPDR S&P Bank ETF rose 2.\nUS benchmark equity indexes were little changed intraday as companies continued to report financial\nJohnson & Johnson reports strong first-quarter 2025 results, raises revenue guidance and boosts its quarterly dividends.\nOmnicom (OMC) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of 4.29% and 0.15%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 2025. Do the numbers hold clues to what lies ahead for the stock?\nWe recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. On Friday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer outlined what investors should focus on in the week, especially […]\nWhile the top- and bottom-line numbers for Omnicom (OMC) give a sense of how the business performed in the quarter ended March 2025, it could be worth looking at how some of its key metrics compare to Wall Street estimates and year-ago values.\nMerrill Lynch and Bank of America’s Private Bank posted a flat profit for the first quarter of 2025 amid a strong earnings beat for their parent company.  BofA’s  wealth unit reported net income of $1 billion in the first quarter, down 0.1% from the fourth quarter and nearly identical to the first quarter in 2024.  The wealth division reported total revenue of $6.02 billion for the first quarter, up nearly 8% from $5.59 billion a year ago as clients and assets under management both increased during the period.\nHealth care giant Johnson & Johnson expects about $400 million in tariff-related costs this year.  The costs will be felt primarily within the company's medical technology unit, which makes a range of medical devices and surgical products.  The most substantial impact comes from tariffs against China and retaliatory tariffs from China, said Joseph Wolk, Johnson & Johnson's chief financial officer, in a conference call with analysts following the company's latest earnings results.\nCVX, COP and EOG offer stability and upside, as OPEC's outlook signals slower growth but confirms oil's lasting role in the global economy.\nFutures edged down Tuesday morning, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow trading just below break-even, as investors braced for a flurry of corporate earnings. The muted open followed Monday’s tech-led rally, which briefly masked deeper market jitters tied to tariffs and macro uncertainty.\nTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results\nSign in to access your portfolio\n\n\n\nTry again."

The market’s third borrower Tuesday, Japanese financial firm Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., priced $3 billion of notes.\nThe longest portion of Wells’ offering, an 11-year security, yields 1.28 percentage point above Treasuries, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified as the details are private. Goldman’s longest portion, a six-year tranche, yields 1.25 percentage point above Treasuries, a separate person said.\nMorgan Stanley, JPMorgan Lead $16.5 Billion Bank Borrowing Spree\nIt’s common for the biggest US banks to sell debt shortly after releasing quarterly results. But there were some questions this go-around after the primary market froze earlier this month in the wake of an evolving global trade war.\nTuesday’s deals received orders 3.3 times the amount of bonds sold, according to Bloomberg’s Brian Smith, compared with 3.8 times on Monday.\n“Clearly there’s appetite for sizable bank issuances,” said Peter Simon, an analyst who covers the sector at research firm CreditSights. “We don’t see much evidence that the market is overly concerned with these banks, which makes sense given their results have been solid this quarter.”\nGoldman reported record revenue in the first quarter, while Wells Fargo’s report pointed to soft loan demand amid the ongoing tariff uncertainty. Wells’ net interest income, the difference between what it makes from lending and pays for deposits, fell short of analysts’ projections. Still, non-interest expenses were better than forecast as Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf works to cut costs.\nIn the high-grade market, banks have underperformed in recent weeks, with TD Securities credit strategist Hans Mikkelsen writing that was likely due to expectations of new debt sales. The average bank bond spread widened 24 basis points this month through Monday, more than investment-grade notes overall while yields for the latter briefly hit 11-month highs last week.\nThat has lured yield buyers into the market, setting things up well to digest the banks’ debt sales, said Samuel Wilson, a portfolio manager at Voya Investment Management.\nBank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. are candidates to issue debt after they released first-quarter results Tuesday.\nComing into earnings season, JPMorgan strategists Kabir Caprihan and Vincent Barretta predicted the six big US banks could might issue about $32 billion of bonds.

RBC Capital Markets bank analyst Gerard Cassidy joins Market Domination to break down what's driving bank earnings.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.\nBank of America and Citi reporting first quarter earnings this morning, beating on the top and bottom lines and following a trend of strong Q1 bank earnings. For more, we're bringing in now Gerard Cassidy, analyst at RBC Capital markets, covering the banking sector. Gerard, it's great to see you as always. So, listen, the bank earnings they continue to roll in, Gerard. We heard from Bank of America and Citi this morning. Investors clearly like what they heard there. Both those stocks are higher in today's trade. Broadly, how would you characterize what we've heard, Gerard, from the sector you know so well? I mean, it has seemed generally positive, Gerard.\nJosh, you're absolutely right. The results have been good. Um, the banks have generally beaten all of our estimates on the street consensus EPS estimates as well as my own. And I think part of the reason is of course, the capital markets businesses for the large money center banks and for Goldman and Morgan Stanley were really strong in trading, particularly equity trading. So that was a large reason for the beats from most of these companies. Also credit. Credit remains very resilient even though they're building up reserves as they're required to do under the new accounting standard called CECL, current expected credit losses. When I say new, it's January of 2020 when it was introduced. So I think what we're seeing is that you know, the first quarter of course had two months of no commentary about tariffs. It was only in March that the commentary started to be elevated. And April of course has been very volatile. So I think what we're seeing is first quarter results overall are better than expected. Credits strong. Capital levels are very healthy. Liquidity is high. It's really the future and the unknown of the future that has everybody on edge.\nHow long do you think the elevated volatility, that the trading volume that comes from that, can make up for muted deal activity? Can that continue for a couple of quarters or is there a limit to how far that could take you?\nIt's a really good question because it was outstanding in the first quarter and it did more than offset, you know, the lower, the lower numbers in some of the selected investment banking categories, particularly ECM, equity capital markets. The IPO market has really kind of fizzled out here due to this volatility. So you really need volatility and volumes to go with it to enable these larger firms to offset any slowdown in activity and advisory, which is M&A activity of course, and then the ECM business. Um, the DCM, debt capital markets had a very strong first couple of months of the year. It has slowed down a little bit. So you're right, we will need to see elevated volumes and volatility if the investment banking markets don't come back. Ideally, if we could have some resiliency in the markets and less volatility, you might get a combination of lower revenues and trading, but more than offset by incremental pickup in the advisory and the ECM business. So we'll have to see how that plays out, but right now the uncertainty is really weighing on the ECM and advisory business at this time.\nA federal judge has ordered Bank of America to pay more than $540 million to resolve long-running litigation from a U.S. regulator that alleged the company underpaid mandatory assessments for deposit insurance.

A: Alastair Borthwick, CFO: We ended the quarter with $7 billion in earnings, allowing us to increase the share buyback from $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion. We are growing into our capital by investing in the business, and we still have flexibility to increase the buyback. We don't have a specific CET1 target yet, as we await full clarity on capital requirements.\nQ: What drove the strength in loan and deposit growth in Q1, and what is the outlook for commercial loan growth given policy uncertainties? A: Brian Moynihan, CEO: We've been investing in building more commercial bankers globally, which is now paying off. Despite potential economic changes, our increased capacity and use of AI for efficiency are driving growth. We expect this to continue across the board.\nQ: What were the dynamics of setting the loan loss reserve this quarter, and how did you account for potential economic changes? A: Alastair Borthwick, CFO: We set reserves using data as of 3/31, with the ability to add judgmental layers. We use blue-chip economic indicators for baseline assumptions, which have moved down in terms of economic growth. Our reserve is set closer to an unemployment rate of around 6% for 2025-2026.\nQ: How are you managing expenses, and is the full-year expense growth expectation of 2% to 3% still valid? A: Alastair Borthwick, CFO: Yes, we still expect full-year expenses to grow 2% to 3%. It might be towards the higher end, but it depends on fee developments throughout the year.\nQ: How do you view the impact of potential rate cuts on your net interest income (NII) targets? A: Alastair Borthwick, CFO: We expect to maintain our Q4 NII target despite four anticipated rate cuts. The cuts are expected later in the year, so they won't significantly impact 2025 but may pose a headwind in 2026. Our long-term target remains a 2.3% NIM.\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\nLast week's rally in the broader stock market indexes sprung the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) back upward after a more than 20% that technically put it into a bear market.

Revenue also rose at all of these banks. Trading revenue alone jumped 17% to more than $36 billion.\nMany banks said their consumer customers were still spending, defaults were still manageable, and businesses were not experiencing distress despite the uncertainty about the months ahead. None of the institutions with big Wall Street footprints updated their earnings outlooks for the rest of the year, either.\nWhat these results didn't include, however, was the volatile period that followed Trump's April 2 \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement, which took place two days after the quarter ended. Stocks and bonds plunged and have yet to fully recover, ushering in new uncertainty about the economy and the safety of US assets.\n\"We're surprised about the degree of ongoing firmwide strength at all 5 big banks ... and the more than expected upbeat views,\" said Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo in a Tuesday note.\n\"To us, it all says that events since Apr 2 can still be little more than a speed bump, so long as policy moves faster to help ease most of the uncertainty,\" he added, in reference to promised deregulation of the banking industry expected from the Trump administration.\nNot that banks and their top executives were entirely upbeat. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said that the prospect of a recession \"has increased.\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the economy faces \"considerable turbulence,\" with a recession as a \"likely outcome.\"\nIn such a scenario, he added, \"earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down.\"\nBut many bankers were noticeably more optimistic. The word \"recession\" did not come up once on Citigroup's Tuesday earnings calls with analysts. Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, also offered an optimistic vision of the current turmoil.\n\"When all is said and done, and longstanding trade imbalances and other structural shifts are behind us, the U.S. will still be the world's leading economy,\" she said in a statement with the bank's Tuesday earnings release.\nBrian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, went out of his way on Tuesday to note that his bank's research team doesn't see a recession happening in 2025.\nRead more: What is a recession, and how does it impact you?\nUS consumers, he added, keep \"pushing money into the economy,\" and the lender's business clients \"remain profitable, liquid and have strong results.\"\nBut \"nobody has a perfect crystal ball,\" Moynihan acknowledged, noting that \"we potentially face a changing economy in the future.\"\nSome banks even showed a rise in investment banking income during the first quarter, defying predictions of a slowdown. Executives acknowledged some deals were now on hold due to uncertainties, but many described the pullbacks as temporary rather than long-lasting.\n\"I'm saying pause versus delete,\" Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick told analysts of the current investment banking environment. \"We don't know whether the economy is going to contract.\"\nEven amid the optimism, there were signs that banks are preparing for harder times. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo (WFC) added $8.4 billion in provisions to account for future loan losses.\nThe figure was 29% higher than the year-ago period and 9% higher than the previous quarter.\n\"We're still in a cloudy period.

Brent crude futures fell 21 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $64.67 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 20 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $61.33.  The International Energy Agency followed on Tuesday with its projection that global oil demand in 2025 will grow at its slowest rate for five years due to worries about economic growth from Trump’s trade tariffs.\nWith President Donald Trump announcing a wide set of tariffs, there could be increased costs for a range of companies.

It slightly pared losses after China said it wants to see a number of steps from the US administration before it agrees to trade talks.\n“All this uncertainty and talk of more tariffs is fueling the idea of de-risking from US assets — sell the dollar,” said Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign-exchange strategist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney. “Euro and Swiss franc are prime candidates of that flow, even as the trade war escalates and global growth deteriorates.”\nHaven currencies including the Swiss franc and yen rallied earlier alongside the euro while demand for long-volatility exposure surged. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slid as much as 0.6% on Wednesday after rising for the first time in six days on Tuesday.\nThe greenback gauge has slumped more than 3% so far in April, on track for its steepest monthly decline since late 2022, amid deepening concerns about a trade war-driven US recession and the dollar’s appeal as a safe haven.\n“We see the era of strong dollar as having peaked,” Jefferies International chief economist and strategist Mohit Kumar wrote in a note to clients. “US dollar weakness is likely to continue. Our favorite version of a weaker dollar has been long gold as central banks seek to diversify out of US dollar in alternatives.”\nIn another sign of weakening confidence in traditional safe-haven US assets, Treasuries suffered their worst selloff in more than two decades last week due to worries that foreign holders such as China were reducing ownership.\nFund managers are the most bearish on the dollar since 2006, according to a Bank of America survey. That sentiment is now spilling into options markets, where traders are paying a premium — for the first time in five years — to hedge against a weaker greenback over the next 12 months.\nWhat Bloomberg strategists say...\n“The US’s tariff policy, capital outflow, and the assault on the dollar as a politically meddle-free global financial instrument are keeping pressure on the US currency. In this environment, other currencies, such as sterling, are likely to remain overall supported, with weak domestic fundamentals only providing fleeting headwinds, until the dollar looks cheap enough again to attract buyers despite its new risks.”\n—Simon White, Macro Strategist, London\nOne-week risk reversals, a gauge of sentiment, show the same trend as they hover near record bearish levels, while volatility gauges indicate traders aren’t counting on calm anytime soon.

This has tipped the buy/sell ratio to 0.40, keeping it near the highest level since late 2023. While corporate executives often buy stock for reasons unrelated to market performance, the uptick in purchases suggests a confidence in their companies that’s reassuring to investors who’ve been battered by the weeks-long selloff.\n“This is a positive sign,” said Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management. “Investors are still mired in a negative feedback loop, given trade and economic uncertainty. So it’s pivotal for this trend to continue as the stock market attempts to get its sea legs.”\nGrowing optimism from corporate executives stands in contrast to the broader risk-off mood. Investor sentiment regarding economic prospects is the most negative in three decades. Global fund managers are gloomy, with 82% of respondents to a monthly Bank of America global survey expected the global economy to weaken. A record number of them intend to reduce exposure to US equities, according to the poll.\nThat’s as investors are dealing with inflation that risks becoming entrenched because of a global trade war and the possibility of a recession. It’s the reason some, like EP Wealth Advisors’ Adam Phillips, are reluctant to overstate the trend of insider share purchases.\n“Like so many others, a lot of these companies are flying blind as they await clarity around trade policies,” Phillips, managing director of portfolio strategy at the firm, said.\nBuying and selling among corporate executives has a track record of providing an early read on market direction. The insider buy-sell ratio jumped in August 2015 and late 2018, with the former preceding a market bottom and the latter coinciding with one. In March 2020, corporate insiders’ purchases correctly signaled the bottom of a bear-market rout.\nThe number of sellers historically exceeds that of buyers as executives often view their stock as a source of cash.\nEarlier this year, corporate insiders timed the stock-market correction right before the S&P 500 Index peaked in mid-February. They dumping shares of their own companies in most of January at an unprecedented pace, before reversing the move in the final days of the month.\nThis time, cash levels have posted their largest two-month increase since the throes of the pandemic, according to BofA, which could bode well for stocks when sentiment turns around. The money they’re sitting on could be used to buy stocks, and Plurimi Wealth’s Patrick Armstrong argues that now is precisely the time to build that equities exposure.\n“The fact that insiders are scooping up their shares, cash levels are climbing and sentiment is so extremely bearish is an early indicator that the market selloff is beginning to make stocks more attractive,” Armstrong, who is the firm’s chief investment officer, said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nScotiabank raised the firm’s price target on AngloGold Ashanti (AU) to $42 from $34 and keeps a Sector Perform rating on the shares.

Currently the net annual result is approximately $100 million negative for our business,\" CEO William Oplinger said during a post-earnings conference call.  The aluminum producer said the tariffs on Canadian imports had cost the company roughly $20 million in the first quarter, ended March 31.\nU.S. shoppers stepped up their shopping last month, fueled by a spending spree on big ticket items, particularly cars, before President Donald Trump’s expansive new tariffs started kicking in.

But an outgrowth of shifting tariff policies has sparked another lucrative exchange on Wall Street: the volatility trade.\nA surge in trading activity has shuttled billions of dollars to the nation’s largest banks as investors have attempted to protect their money or deploy it in the face of market gyrations.\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's \n                        \n                            Terms\n                        \n                     and \n                        \n                            Privacy Policy\n                        \n\nEarnings reports from the big five banks in recent days revealed they collectively raked in nearly $37 billion in trading revenue this past quarter, touting record sales from equities changing hands.\nWarren Buffett famously urged investors to “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” A corollary for the financial institutions facilitating those trades is to sit back in any environment and collect fees.\nWall Street wants stocks to go up, sure, but most importantly, it just wants stocks to move.\nThe big banks' trading may mostly be for hedge funds, pensions, and large companies — big institutional investors. But everyone's rolling up their sleeves at the volatility and tinkering with their portfolios, looking to optimize or take advantage of the moment.\nAs my colleague Josh Schafer reports, everybody's trading. Dip-buying flows following the week of “Liberation Day” reached record levels, according to data from VandaTrack, including $3 billion in net purchases on April 3. That was the largest daily total since VandaTrack began collecting the data in 2014.\nBuying at recent lows and FOMO trading explained much of the heightened activity. But another interpretation is that an entire class of retail investor has been trained to throw their cash into stocks in a continuation of a pandemic-era shift in personal finance.\nYou are probably better off not looking at your diminished 401(k) account when the market is convulsing. But pushing an order on a trading app has become something of a pastime for an increasingly large American demographic, the foundation for group chats among young people, and the basis for an entire genre of aspirational lifestyle content.\nThat big banks' big shot clients are doing this too is a great \"stars, they're just like us\" moment. But it's also part and parcel of the same volatility that's been a hallmark of the 2025 stock market and a lesson in the importance of a diversified portfolio of banks' business lines.\nThat these banks can up their profitability amid economic uncertainty and a lack of an anticipated IPO boom isn’t unique to volatile trading. A similar dynamic was at play earlier this year, when a major market narrative was whether the Fed would continue to ease rates. (The Fed cut rates in September, November, and December but has since paused.)\nFurther rate cuts would have curtailed banks’ lending margins, which were supercharged by the central bank’s years-long tightening campaign. But the big banks could have done just fine in a low-rate environment because they can lean on other commercial operations to cover revenue losses elsewhere.\nThe diversified nature of financial services allows the nation's biggest banks to profit even when the outlook grows darker. It's not clear how the American exceptionalism trade will unfold in the months ahead. Tax cuts and other business-friendly deregulatory efforts are in the offing.\nIn the meantime, as long as money is still moving and greasing the trading gears, at least one part of Wall Street will be happy.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Business leaders are working to manage volatility and an evolving economic environment, as the goalpost keeps moving on policies.\nBank of America (BofA) CFO Alastair Borthwick offered some insight into what the bank is hearing from its commercial clients—concerns over trade policy and recent market turmoil have grown. “What our clients are telling us is they're looking for certainty,” Borthwick said during a media call on Tuesday. BofA’s commercial clients range from small businesses to middle-market and large corporations.\nThey’re seeking clarity, not just around trade policy, but also the tax package and regulatory reform. “Every day provides a little more information” and also “a little bit more in the way of certainty for people,” he said.\nHe added: “It's a slow-growth environment. That's what we continue to try and support our clients through.”\nCFOs certainly are grappling with tariff uncertainty. Some are taking actions such as devising alternative-sourcing plans, stockpiling greater inventory, and creating financial buffers.\nHowever, BofA's research team at this point doesn't believe we'll see a recession, Borthwick said. And clients continue to show \"encouraging signs.\" Employment remains healthy, and consumers have proven resilient, he said.\nFor its Q1, Bank of America reported on Tuesday net income of $7.4 billion and earnings per share of 90 cents, up from 76 cents the same time last year. Revenue growth was 6%. It was driven by net interest income (NII), which was up 3% from the prior year, reaching $14.6 billion, partially helped by lower deposit costs. NII is the difference between what the bank earns on loans and investments and pays out on its liabilities, including deposits.\nBofA maintained its guidance that NII will reach $15.5 to $15.7 billion in the fourth quarter and achieve 6% to 7% year-over-year growth for 2025, Borthwick said. This goes against the grain of what’s becoming more common this earnings season—some companies are pulling guidance due to tariff tumult.\n“We run our business to withstand volatility over the short and the long term and through our responsible growth strategy,” Borthwick said on the media call. BofA is prepared to manage through any potential downturn in the economy, he said.\nAn analyst asked during BofA’s Q1 earnings call on Tuesday if there will be any potential impacts from the U.S. stock market losing trillions in wealth following the announcement of the Trump administration's sweeping tariff policy.\nThe real risk in any bank's balance sheet is going to be its credit posture, CEO Brian Moynihan said on the call. Even if there is “a very slight recession…we should fare well in that,” he said.\nNo one has a crystal ball to perfectly predict the future, Moynihan said. BofA is positioning itself for every outcome, he said. “But we don't want people to lose sight of the strong performance of this company and our team in the first quarter of 2025,” Moynihan said.\nSheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nThe purchases are a sign of confidence despite growing concern about an economic slowdown this year.\nAs chair of the House Financial Services Committee, French Hill is helping shepherd key crypto legislation.\nPatreon is finally experimenting with native livestreaming, a new feature that could attract more creators and help them earn more money.

These simple reforms could lower the cost of mortgages by 70–80 basis points.\"\nThis push for reform comes as JPMorgan's mortgage volume fell to $11.2 billion in the first quarter ending March 31, down from $14.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, home lending from the bank's retail channel fell to $9.4 billion from $12.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nOther banks have also struck a similar tone during recent conference calls following quarterly earnings.\nBank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan told investors during the company’s first quarter earnings call this week that he is hopeful for change as new policymakers take office.\n\"It’s critically important that we get this rebalance,\" Moynihan said. \"Sometimes the regulation gets in the way of that.” At Bank of America, home lending held steady at $254 billion in the first quarter, unchanged from the previous quarter.\nWells Fargo (WFC) CEO Charles Scharf echoed Dimon’s sentiment, telling analysts last week that the bank supports the administration’s deregulatory push. Scharf said the proposed changes would allow \"more loans, take more deposits, and provide more liquidity to the markets while preserving robust regulatory oversight.\"\nWells Fargo’s mortgage volume fell to $4.4 billion in the first quarter ending March 31, down from $5.9 billion the previous quarter, further underscoring the broader slowdown in housing financing activity.\nData from the National Association of Realtors showed pending home sales, a forward looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings, grew 2% in February. However, pending transactions are down 3.6% year over year, underscoring the ongoing challenges in the housing market.\nThe average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage stood at 6.92% as of last week, not far from the highest levels seen over the last several years.\nRead more: Best low- and no-down-payment mortgage lenders of 2025\nThe banking industry has long been lobbying for a scaled-back version of the “Basel Endgame” capital rule, which requires financial institutions to hold significantly more capital as part of a broader post-2008 effort to strengthen the financial system.\nBanks argue that higher capital requirements restrict their ability to offer mortgages, car loans, credit cards, and small business loans.\nPresident Trump's Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, in a speech last week before the American Bankers Association, called for \"modernizing\" capital requirements but said the latest proposal \"is not, in my opinion, the right starting point for our modernization effort.\"\nBessent added, \"Modernizing regulatory capital likely would mean reduced capital requirements for mortgage loans and some other exposures that are core to the community bank model.\"\nMeanwhile, Trump officials are also revisiting efforts to privatize Fannie and Freddie, a major policy goal that first Trump administration couldn't pull off. Bessent said the decision to release the two companies will come down to the trajectory of mortgage rates.\nIn his annual letter, JPMorgan's Dimon cited data from the Urban Institute estimating that mortgage market reforms could boost mortgage originations by 1 million annually, particularly helping lower-income borrowers and first-time homebuyers targeting homes in the $150,000-$300,000 range.\nRead more: 2025 housing market: Is it a good time to buy a house?\nAccording to Zillow, the average US home value sits at $361,263, up 2.1% over the past year.\n“Buying a home, still a pillar of the American Dream, is simply the best way for individuals to start building household wealth,” Dimon wrote.\nDani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The dollar fell to a fresh six-month low as traders were whiplashed again by a slew of tariff headlines, with Trump launching an investigation into the need for levies on critical minerals.\nGold briefly pared gains following a report that China is open to trade talks if the US names a point person to represent the country and shows respect by reining in disparaging remarks, according to a person familiar with the Chinese government’s thinking.\nThe precious metal has climbed more than 26% this year and hit a series of record highs as the escalating trade war creates anxiety over a possible global recession and as investors struggle to take long-term positions due to the unpredictability of tariff announcements from Washington.\n“I’d love to have a pound for every time someone said it’s a record high in gold in the last few weeks,” Evy Hambro, thematic and sector investing global head at Blackrock Inc., said on Bloomberg Television. “The gold market is kind of thriving in this period of uncertainty, but the foundations are very tangible and real.”\nLeading banks remain optimistic about bullion’s prospects over the coming quarters as investors add to holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded funds and central banks continue to accumulate the metal.

It also said it’s negotiating with dozens of other trading partners to lower trade barriers in exchange for relief on higher duties.\n“The power struggle between major countries will continue,” said Luchen Wang, a Shanghai-based analyst at Galaxy Futures Co. “Gold’s appeal as a safe-haven asset means it’s more likely to rise than fall in the near- to medium-term.”\nTraders are also betting there will be at least three Federal Reserve rate cuts this year. Monetary easing is generally positive for the precious metal.\nGold was up 3.1% to $3,330.28 an ounce as of 12:32 p.m. in New York, after earlier hitting a record of $3,333.08.

Moreover, its efforts to increase its deposits and loans should boost its top profits over the long term, the Canadian bank believes.\nRBC Capital is impressed by BAC's low-cost deposit base.\nFinally, RBC, noting that BAC  has taken meaningful steps to reduce its risk following the Great Financial Crisis, believes that these measures will help the bank maintain its current profit levels in the face of a potential recession.\nMore About BAC Stock\nAnalysts on average expect the bank's earnings per share to climb to $3.64 this year and $4.26 in 2026 from $3.21 in 2024.\nIn the last month, the shares have fallen 10%, while they have dropped 20% in the last three months.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of BAC, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by potential trade policy changes and corporate tax discussions, which could impact business confidence and growth.

Reed-Klages, who has served as a Director since June 2015, will remain on the Board as independent Presiding Director, a position she has held since June 2022.\n\"We are deeply grateful for Jim's leadership and appreciate the outstanding results he achieved during his tenure. His impact on our customers, dealers, shareholders and employees will continue for years to come,\" Reed-Klages said. \"Joe's selection as CEO is the result of a multi-year succession planning process by the Board of Directors.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this construction equipment company have returned -13%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Manufacturing - Construction and Mining industry, which Caterpillar falls in, has lost 12%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCaterpillar is expected to post earnings of $4.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.9%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.41 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -11.4%. This estimate has changed -1.7% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.69 indicates a change of +11.7% from what Caterpillar is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Caterpillar.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Caterpillar, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.61 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -7.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $62.51 billion and $65.47 billion estimates indicate -3.6% and +4.7% changes, respectively.\nCaterpillar reported revenues of $16.22 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5%. EPS of $5.14 for the same period compares with $5.23 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.64 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.57%. The EPS surprise was +3.42%.\nOver the last four quarters, Caterpillar surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCaterpillar is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Caterpillar. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Umpleby, who led  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) through a multiyear operational turnaround, will become executive chairman.\nBarclays said the internal promotion brings “no surprises” and reflects a succession process that’s been “quasi investor-facing for several years.” Brokerage noted Creed’s strong background in both engineering and finance, two areas investors closely watch, positions him to carry forward the company’s focus on operational discipline, aftermarket growth, and capital efficiency.\n“Creed is a known entity to capital markets,” Barclays said, pointing to his appearances in investor settings and past roles, including interim CFO and head of the Energy & Transportation segment.\nOppenheimer echoed the view, saying the timing, aligned with Caterpillar’s 100th anniversary, signals continuity and confidence. “While Mr. Creed will be stepping into the role at a challenging part in the cycle and amid a dynamic macro backdrop, we believe the well-telegraphed internal succession, and Mr. Umpleby’s transition to Executive Chairman likely limits the impact on shares,” the firm wrote.\nCreed, a 28-year Caterpillar veteran, has held leadership posts across key business units including Electric Power, Oil & Gas, and Marine. He was named COO in October 2023, widely seen as a precursor to his elevation to CEO.\nAnalysts highlighted Creed’s leadership in Energy & Transportation as key to Caterpillar’s evolving strategy. Barclays noted investor focus on the segment has grown alongside demand for data centers and power generation, where Caterpillar sees potential for competitive differentiation.\nUmpleby’s tenure is credited with restoring stability and profitability through a renewed focus on core businesses. Barclays said his leadership saw Caterpillar streamline its operations, prioritize R&D, and make selective, strategic acquisitions like the $400 million deal for Weir’s Oil & Gas unit.\nRelated articles\nWall Street sees strategic continuity as Caterpillar names Creed CEO\nBofA downgrades U.S. chemical sector amid slowdown\nBernstein starts Xiaomi at ‘outperform,’ sees EV push as key equity driver\nHalliburton (HAL) doesn't possess the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely earnings beat in its upcoming report.

Creed appointed as the new CEO effective May 1, 2025. This leadership transition, along with adjustments to executive compensation, appears timely with the company's stock seeing a 6% rise last week. This move aligned closely with broader market trends where major indexes were buoyed by tech and bank stocks amid easing U.S.-China trade tensions. Within this context, Caterpillar's announcements likely added positive sentiment, supporting the stock's alignment with the market's upward trajectory, which saw a similar 7% climb over the same period.\nWe've identified 2 possible red flags with Caterpillar and understanding the impact should be part of your investment process.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 20 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nThe recent leadership change at Caterpillar, with Joseph E. Creed stepping in as CEO, might further solidify the company's strategic focus on sustainability and growth in alternative fuel markets. This aligns with Caterpillar's ongoing investments in capacity expansion and new technologies, potentially improving long-term revenue growth. While recent executive changes have buoyed short-term sentiment, impacting weekly stock performance positively, the firm's share price also reflects longstanding investor confidence with a total return of 186.72% over the last five years. This context frames a robust performance relative to the broader US market and offers a clear view of its trajectory beyond near-term fluctuations.\nAnalysis shows Caterpillar's shares are somewhat discounted compared to the consensus analyst price target of US$365.99, which indicates potential upward movement of over 20%. If the new leadership can successfully navigate near-term challenges such as lower sales volumes and an unfavorable product mix, revenue and earnings forecasts could improve in line with market expectations. A focus on high-margin services and strategic capital deployment could further enhance shareholder returns despite potential revenue pressures in certain sectors. As the company continues to pursue its sustainability goals, any advancements could further align with long-term market trends, potentially justifying current and future valuations.\nDive into the specifics of Caterpillar here with our thorough balance sheet health report.\n This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

WTI traded down to $56 a barrel and has been gyrating between $55 and $65 ever since.\nWhile lower oil prices can mean good news for consumers at the pump, it’s bad news for the energy producers who are unhedged and have certain breakeven levels.\nThe oil and natural gas stocks have gotten hammered due to falling commodity prices and the uncertainty from the tariff turbulence of 2025. Although oil escaped direct American tariffs.\nEnergy companies are lumped into different categories within the oil industry. In this podcast, Tracey talks about “Big Oil” which are the large, integrated oil companies and the American explorers and producers, or the “E & Ps.”\nThe Integrated Oil stocks, as an industry, are down just 3.9% year-to-date. But the American E&Ps, as an industry, are now down 27.8% on the year.\nThe E&Ps, which do not have refining, chemicals, or other divisions to offset their production, are much more volatile when oil sells off.\nJust because a stock sells-off and now has a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, doesn’t mean that it’s a true value in the classical sense of the word.\nRemember, a true value stock is cheap on a P/E basis, but also has rising earning estimates.\nAre the energy stocks cheap, or just traps?\nExxon Mobil is a large American integrated oil company. Shares of Exxon are down 7.1% year-to-date but have finally started sinking in the last month, falling 10.6% in that time.\nExxon appears cheap with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.1. The 2025 Zacks Consensus Estimate is looking for $7.13 but that’s 8.5% under the $7.79 Exxon made last year. One earnings estimate has been revised higher for 2025 and 2 lower in the last week.\nExxon is a dividend all-star, with its dividend currently yielding 3.9%.\nIs Exxon Mobil a value or a trap in 2025?\nChevron is also a large, American integrated oil company. Shares of Chevron are down 6.8% year-to-date but have been hit harder over the last month than Exxon. It’s down 14.3% during that time. But there have been dramatic one-day swings the last week.\nChevron is cheap. It has a forward P/E of 13.3. The Zacks Consensus is looking for $10.30 in 2025, which is earnings growth of 2.5% as it made $10.05 in 2024.\nChevron also pays an attractive dividend, yielding 4.8%.\nIs Chevron a value after the sell-off or a trap?\nEOG Resources is a large cap American exploration and production company. It produces in key basins including the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, and Dorado Play. EOG Resources has a strategy of returning at a minimum of 70% of annual free cash flow to shareholders.\nShares of EOG Resources have fallen 14.7% year-to-date but have really taken it on the chin in the last month, declining 16.9%. It’s cheap, with a forward P/E of 9.5. A P/E under 10 is usually considered a dirt-cheap stock.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is looking for $11.09. EOG Resources made $11.62 last year so that is a decline of 4.6%.\nEOG Resources is currently paying a dividend yielding 3.5%.\nIs EOG Resources a value or a trap in 2025?\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

This move has left at least two tankers loaded with Venezuelan crude stranded at the port. In contrast, four others were forced to depart empty, indicating a significant intensification in the U.S.-Venezuela energy standoff.\nThe turmoil follows the Trump administration’s recent decision to revoke Chevron’s license to operate in Venezuela. Although the license was set to expire with a wind-down period ending May 27, PDVSA has begun enforcing restrictions ahead of schedule. These actions have derailed the company’s plans to export oil, even for cargoes that were already loaded and awaiting departure.\nTwo Chevron-chartered tankers, named Dubai Attraction and Carina Voyage, remained idle in Venezuelan waters, pending authorization to return their cargoes. These shipments had been formally declared to Venezuela’s customs authority, and now require new clearance to be unloaded or rerouted. Meanwhile, four other Chevron vessels — Pegasus Star, Ionic Anax, Calypso and Sea Jaguar — were denied loading access altogether.\nCarina Voyager was en route to Chevron's Pascagoula refinery in Mississippi, while Dubai Attraction was slated to transfer its cargo to the Valero Energy-chartered tanker, Cap Corpus Christi, near Aruba. However, the Cap Corpus Christi departed for the United States on Friday only partially loaded, as it was unable to complete the ship-to-ship transfer.\nThe Venezuelan vice president placed the blame entirely on U.S. sanctions. In a Telegram post, the nation cited that Chevron, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), was not able to pay PDVSA due to the U.S.-driven economic war, thus prompting the return of crude shipments. The shipments are now being rerouted to other international markets, suggesting Venezuela’s intention to gain some alternative buyers.\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nChevron’s joint ventures in Venezuela produce roughly 25% of the country’s total oil output, which reached an average of 250,000 barrels per day to the United States in early 2025. The sudden halt in its exports not only jeopardizes this flow but also threatens to deepen Venezuela’s economic and political isolation.\nU.S. sanctions had earlier stifled Venezuela’s crude trade with China due to the imposition of a 25% secondary tariff on any country that traded with the United States. However, Reuters reports indicate that shipments to China have resumed, although slowly and cautiously.\nThe recent moves also affect other major energy companies. Licenses previously granted to Shell plc SHEL and BP p.l.c. BP have also been revoked, disrupting planned offshore gas projects and a license for French oil firm Maurel & Prom to operate in Venezuela. European firms such as Eni S.p.A. E and Repsol, S.A. REPYY are no longer allowed to receive oil from Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA in lieu of payments. The Trump administration’s broader objective appears to be pressuring president Nicolás Maduro by tightening control over Venezuela’s largest revenue source — its vast crude reserves.\nSHEL, a London-based oil supermajor and BP, an integrated energy company, had plans to send gas to Trinidad and Tobago through a natural gas project that operated offshore Venezuela. However, the U.S. sanctions gave a major blow to the plans of SHEL and BP.\nBoth BP and SHEL have been hit hard by the withdrawal of the licenses for two gas fields in Venezuelan waters that they plan to develop with Trinidad and Tobago and its National Gas Company.\nIn March 2024, REPYY and E also received a notification from the U.S. authorities regarding their revocation of oil licenses for operations in Venezuela.\nRepsol SA explores, develops and produces crude oil products and natural gas, and transports petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gas.\nItaly-based Eni SpA is among the leading integrated energy players in the world. The upstream operations include the exploitation and production of oil and natural gas resources.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the trends in March are not so different from what's happening now, as consumer sentiment was rapidly weakening and fears of a recession were mounting before the tariff announcement.\nLet's take a look at the two best-performing Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI -1.73%) companies to see if they're worth buying today.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.30%) is one of the most resilient stocks on the market. Healthcare is considered a recession-proof industry, but health insurance is even more unaffected by the economy because people need coverage regardless.\nIt's not a surprise, then, that investors have piled into the stock in March and have continued to do so through the tariff-related chaos of April.\nThere was no major company-specific news out on UnitedHealth in March, and investors seem to be returning to the stock after it tumbled following the assassination of one of its executives in December 2024.\nUnitedHealth has been one of the rare winners on the stock market in April, gaining 15% thanks to a 5.06% increase in Medicare Advantage benchmarks and its reputation as a port in a storm during turbulent market times.\nChevron (CVX 0.65%) might seem like a surprise on this list as the energy sector is typically highly sensitive to the economic cycle.\nThe source of Chevron's gains was a surprising one, as Reuters reported that the company was angling for a piece of the data center market, developing the sites and supplying the electricity for facilities. \nData center demand is surging along with AI, and the energy to power it is at a premium.\nHowever, while that was a smart strategic move, it wasn't enough to keep the stock climbing in April as it fell sharply after tariffs were announced. Chevron will continue to be sensitive to the health of the global economy and oil prices.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in UnitedHealth Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and UnitedHealth Group wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $526,499!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $687,684!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500. Don't miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\nSee the 10 stocks ›\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\n\n\nJeremy Bowman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

OPEC+ also adjusted its global GDP growth outlook, trimming expectations to 3% for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026, each down by 0.1 percentage point.\nThe global economy showed a steady growth trend at the beginning of the year, the organization said in its monthly oil market report. However, recent trade-related dynamics have introduced higher uncertainty to the short-term global economic growth outlook.\nAmong the factors behind the downgrade, OPEC+ pointed to U.S. President Donald Trump's newly imposed 145% tariffs on China the world's largest crude oil importer as a significant headwind for energy demand.\nDespite the lowered outlook, the oil-producing bloc has agreed to ramp up output starting in May. Analysts warn this move could flood the market with excess supply at a time when consumption is weakening.\nSince the tariff announcement on April 2, oil prices have fallen sharply.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Bank of America Corporation (BAC), Chevron Corporation (CVX) and Stryker Corporation (SYK), as well as two micro-cap stocks Value Line, Inc. (VALU) and Sypris Solutions, Inc. (SYPR). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Today's Featured Research ReportsShares of Bank of America have gained +2.5% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry’s gain of +20.4%. The company’s volatile nature of the trading business is a major headwind. Despite an impressive performance since 2022, it is expected to normalize going forward. This is likely to hamper fee income growth. The Zacks analyst project non-interest income to rise only 3.4% in 2025. Continued investments in the franchise will keep the company’s expenses elevated. We expect total non-interest expenses to rise 3% this year. While high funding costs are still a woe, the company’s net interest income (NII) will be positively impacted by higher rates for longer. The Zacks analyst expects NII to record a CAGR of 5.3% over the next three years. Plans to open financial centers in new and existing markets and improve digital capabilities will aid the top line. We project total revenues to grow 4.8% in 2025.(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here >>>)Chevron’s shares have declined -6.2% over the past six months against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry’s decline of -11.9%. The company being a fully integrated energy firm, is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin. Further, the planned acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana. However, the company is grappling with high sensitivity to oil fluctuations and relatively expensive valuation. Another concern is the weak margins on refined products that forced its downstream segment to its first quarterly loss in 4 years. Considering these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>>)Shares of Stryker have gained +4.3% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Products industry’s gain of +5.5%. The company is poised for growth, driven by rising demand for robotic-assisted procedures, hospital capital expenditures and international expansion. The Mako SmartRobotics platform fuels adoption, while acquisitions like Inari Medical and Vertos Medical enhance the portfolio. Stryker is actively integrating new technologies such as AI-driven imaging and smart surgical systems to improve patient outcomes and maintain its competitive edge. Pricing improvements and a strong hospital order book support 2025 growth. However, foreign exchange volatility and acquisition-related margin pressures may impact earnings. Supply chain disruptions and rising costs could strain profitability. Intensifying competition in robotics and MedTech demands constant innovation. Macroeconomic risks, including potential downturns in healthcare spending and regulatory shifts, add uncertainty.(You can read the full research report on Stryker here >>>)Value Line’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry over the past year (+10% vs. +6.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $370.23 million have robust cash generation, with cash balances rising to $27.1 million from $6.1 million YoY, enhances liquidity and supports dividends, buybacks, and growth investments. EAM Trust income surged 47.7% to $13.8 million, driven by AUM growth to $5 billion, providing a rising, diversified passive income stream. The company maintains disciplined capital returns, paying $0.90/share in dividends and repurchasing shares, with $0.9 million authorization remaining. Portfolio gains doubled to $3.6 million, bolstering earnings. Strong branding and diversified offerings serve both retail and institutional clients, supporting market position. However, core publishing revenue declined to $26.7 million, and customer concentration (30% from one client) heightens risk. Operating costs and taxes rose, further pressuring margins, while limited international presence (~2% of revenues) increases vulnerability to U.S. market shifts.(You can read the full research report on Value Line here >>>)Shares of Sypris Solutions have gained +3.6% over the past year against the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry’s gain of +36.3%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $36.37 million benefits from an extended long-term supply agreement with a global OEM, securing stable revenues as a sole-source supplier of Ultra Axle Shafts. Sypris Solutions’ diversified presence across automotive, energy, and industrial markets reduces risk and positions it to capitalize on growth trends in heavy-duty vehicles and energy infrastructure. Sypris Solutions is also aligned with growth in aerospace and defense electronics, leveraging its capabilities in high-precision components to meet rising demand. Expansion into the Asia-Pacific region aligns with high-growth markets, leveraging regional investments in defense and infrastructure. However, liquidity challenges constrain financial flexibility. Rising costs and reliance on cyclical markets such as heavy vehicles and oil and gas exacerbate margin sensitivity. Competitive pressures in aerospace further heighten vulnerability.(You can read the full research report on Sypris Solutions here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Pfizer Inc.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nOil prices have tumbled this year. WTI, the primary U.S. oil price benchmark, has plunged from about $80 a barrel in early January to around $60 a barrel. The culprit has been the concern that tariffs will slow the global economy, driving down demand for crude oil. \nLower crude prices will impact oil company cash flows. However, some oil stocks are in a better position to navigate the lower oil prices than others due to their abundant low-cost oil resources. Three oil companies that can still thrive in the current environment are Devon Energy (DVN 2.65%), ConocoPhillips (COP 0.69%), and Chevron (CVX 0.65%). \nDevon Energy has a premier multibasin U.S. onshore resource portfolio. The company produces oil and gas from the Rockies, Delaware Basin, Anadarko Basin, and Eagle Ford. That diversification helps reduce risk and enhances its long-term growth profile. \nThe Delaware Basin, which runs through west Texas and southeast New Mexico, is the crown jewel of Devon Energy's portfolio. The company gets 56% of its production from that world-class oil resource. That position will fuel the oil company for years to come. Devon has thousands of remaining drilling locations with an average breakeven level of $40 per barrel. Because of that, it can still make a lot of money drilling in the region at the current oil price point. \nThe company's low-cost resources position it to produce a lot of cash even in the current environment. Devon was on track to make over $3 billion in free cash flow this year when WTI was above $70 a barrel during the first quarter. While that number will decline if crude remains around $60, Devon will still produce a lot of excess cash this year. It plans to return about 70% of that money to shareholders via its dividend and share repurchases, retaining the rest to strengthen its already rock-solid balance sheet. \nConocoPhillips has a global portfolio of low-cost resources. The company held about 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources with a supply cost below $40 a barrel for WTI. It added even more low-cost resources last year when it acquired Marathon Oil. That deal topped off its tank by adding more than 2 billion barrels of resources with an average cost of supply below $30 per barrel for WTI. \nThe company's low-cost resources position it to produce a lot of cash in the current environment. ConocoPhillips initially expected to generate enough excess free cash flow this year to return $10 billion to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. While lower oil prices will impact the amount of excess free cash flow it produces this year, it could still achieve that capital return target thanks to its cash-rich balance sheet. ConocoPhillips ended last year with $6.4 billion of cash and short-term investments and another $1 billion of long-term investments. Meanwhile, it's working toward generating an additional $2 billion in cash via non-core asset sales. \nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nChevron has a globally integrated energy business. That integration between upstream (oil and gas production) and downstream (refining and chemicals) helps mute some of the impact of lower oil prices. The company also has a very low-cost global resource portfolio. \nThe energy giant has stress-tested its business for lower oil prices. Chevron forecasts that it can produce enough cash flow from operations to cover its high-yielding dividend (currently over 5%) and capital spending program at $50 oil through 2027 with room to spare. Meanwhile, the company has the balance sheet capacity to buy back shares at the low end of its $10 billion-$20 billion annual target range during that period at that price point. \nChevron is working to further enhance its low-cost resource portfolio by acquiring Hess. The deal would add a world-class position in offshore Guyana and other high-quality assets to diversify and enhance Chevron's portfolio. It would further bolster the company's low-cost supplies, putting it in an even stronger position to thrive during periods of lower oil prices. \nThe recent downdraft in crude prices will impact the cash flows that oil companies produce. However, Devon Energy, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron have very low-cost operations and strong balance sheets. Because of that, they can still thrive at lower prices by producing lots of cash that they can return to investors through dividends and share repurchases. That makes them lower-risk ways to invest in the oil patch. \n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Devon Energy wasn’t one of them.

But there are two interesting things about this company. First, it is run kind of like a mutual fund. Second, it doesn't pay dividends despite the fact that Buffett often invests in dividend-paying companies. Here's why that matters and why you might want to buy one of these three dividend payers he owns.\nOne of the core tenets of Buffett's investment approach is to buy good companies when they are attractively priced. But the next step is to hold for the long term so he can benefit from the growth of the businesses he buys. One of the nuances that gets lost in this is that he uses the cash generated from the companies he owns outright or owns in Berkshire Hathaway's common stock portfolio to reinvest in his business. That allows him to compound those cash flows over time and this enhances the returns he generates for investors.\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\nFrom a big-picture perspective, you can do the same thing by dividend reinvesting. All it takes is a phone call to your broker, or, more likely, a button press on your broker's website or in its app. And in one quick and easy move you'll be investing more like Warren Buffett.\nBut what if you want to invest even more like Oracle of Omaha? Well, three dividend-paying stocks he owns today are Coca-Cola (KO -0.19%), Chevron (CVX 0.65%), and Kraft Heinz (KHC -2.00%). Here's a look at these three Buffett stocks to see if they'll be a good fit for your Buffett style dividend reinvesting.\nCoca-Cola is a very easy company to like. It is the industry-leading beverage company with a globally diversified business. It is large enough to have economies of scale in distribution, marketing, and research and development, and it can, and does, act as an industry consolidator. The dividend has been increased annually for over five decades, making it a Dividend King. The dividend yield is 2.9%, which is well above the market's yield today.\nFor conservative dividend investors it is a solid choice. The only problem is that the stock looks a little expensive at the moment, with both the price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios above their five-year averages. However, if you are willing to pay a premium for income security, Coca-Cola could be a good fit for your portfolio.\nAnother industry leader in Buffett's portfolio is energy giant Chevron. It is one of the largest integrated energy companies you can buy, with a business that spans from the upstream (energy production) through the midstream (pipelines) and into the downstream (chemicals and refining). This diversification helps to soften the impact of the inherent swings in the commodity-driven energy sector. On top of that, the company has a very strong balance sheet, which allows it to take on leverage during industry downturns to support its business and dividend.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nThe dividend, notably, has been increased annually for 38 years thanks largely to Chevron's solid business model. That said, energy price volatility still has a material impact on the stock price. Right now energy prices are weakening and the dividend yield is a very attractive 4.7%. The yield could go higher if oil prices continue to fall. But the history here suggests that the dividend will continue to get paid even if oil prices continue to fall. You could try to time your entry into Chevron, but the truth is it is a strong energy choice at just about any point of the energy cycle.\nThe last big dividend stock on this list is Kraft Heinz. It is a tough consumer staples stock to love when you compare it to Coca-Cola. Yes, Kraft Heinz's dividend yield is a lofty 5.3%, but the dividend has been static since it was cut in 2019. The big story is the business overhaul that's taking place.\nThe company was created via the merger between Kraft and Heinz. The goal at that time was to cut costs to boost profitability. But cutting costs can only take a company so far before it needs to refocus on growth. That's what Kraft Heinz has been doing, after turning to a new management team. But the results haven't been particularly impressive, which is why the dividend has been stuck in neutral for so long. If you consider this high-yield food maker you'll need to go in understanding that it is a turnaround story that will require extra monitoring. It's probably only appropriate for more aggressive investors.\nWhile Buffett owns Coca-Cola, Chevron, and Kraft Heinz in his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, you don't actually need to own these specific stocks to benefit from dividend reinvestment. These are just three stocks to get you thinking about the real investment tool that's important here, which is the reinvestment of dividends so you can compound your returns over time -- just like Buffett does with his investments.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chevron wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $526,499!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $687,684!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500. Don't miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\nSee the 10 stocks ›\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\n\n\nReuben Gregg Brewer has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The company’s volatile nature of the trading business is a major headwind. Despite an impressive performance since 2022, it is expected to normalize going forward. This is likely to hamper fee income growth.\nThe Zacks analyst project non-interest income to rise only 3.4% in 2025. Continued investments in the franchise will keep the company’s expenses elevated. We expect total non-interest expenses to rise 3% this year. While high funding costs are still a woe, the company’s net interest income (NII) will be positively impacted by higher rates for longer.\nThe Zacks analyst expects NII to record a CAGR of 5.3% over the next three years. Plans to open financial centers in new and existing markets and improve digital capabilities will aid the top line.

The company being a fully integrated energy firm, is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin.\nFurther, the planned acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana. However, the company is grappling with high sensitivity to oil fluctuations and relatively expensive valuation.\nAnother concern is the weak margins on refined products that forced its downstream segment to its first quarterly loss in 4 years. Considering these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.\n(You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>>)\nShares of Stryker have gained +4.3% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Products industry’s gain of +5.5%. The company is poised for growth, driven by rising demand for robotic-assisted procedures, hospital capital expenditures and international expansion. The Mako SmartRobotics platform fuels adoption, while acquisitions like Inari Medical and Vertos Medical enhance the portfolio.\nStryker is actively integrating new technologies such as AI-driven imaging and smart surgical systems to improve patient outcomes and maintain its competitive edge. Pricing improvements and a strong hospital order book support 2025 growth.\nHowever, foreign exchange volatility and acquisition-related margin pressures may impact earnings. Supply chain disruptions and rising costs could strain profitability. Intensifying competition in robotics and MedTech demands constant innovation. Macroeconomic risks, including potential downturns in healthcare spending and regulatory shifts, add uncertainty.\n(You can read the full research report on Stryker here >>>)\nValue Line’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry over the past year (+10% vs. +6.4%).

Portfolio gains doubled to $3.6 million, bolstering earnings. Strong branding and diversified offerings serve both retail and institutional clients, supporting market position.\nHowever, core publishing revenue declined to $26.7 million, and customer concentration (30% from one client) heightens risk. Operating costs and taxes rose, further pressuring margins, while limited international presence (~2% of revenues) increases vulnerability to U.S. market shifts.\n(You can read the full research report on Value Line here >>>)\nShares of Sypris Solutions have gained +3.6% over the past year against the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry’s gain of +36.3%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $36.37 million benefits from an extended long-term supply agreement with a global OEM, securing stable revenues as a sole-source supplier of Ultra Axle Shafts.\nSypris Solutions’ diversified presence across automotive, energy, and industrial markets reduces risk and positions it to capitalize on growth trends in heavy-duty vehicles and energy infrastructure.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other undervalued energy stocks.\nOn March 18, Tortoise Capital senior portfolio manager Rob Thummel appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ to discuss his outlook on the energy sector. He believes that natural gas is positioned to lead growth in the future within the energy sector. This natural gas demand is driven by electricity and energy exports. Thummel noted that the energy and tech sectors are converging due to advancements like AI and data centers. Electricity demand fuels natural gas consumption, while US energy exports help meet global needs for low-cost and low-carbon energy. He also highlighted that the US is now emerging as the largest exporter of LNG, even though it was an LNG importer just years ago. He anticipates that the US LNG exports will soon 2x in volume over time. Thummel also expects Europe and other countries to prioritize energy security and diversify their supply sources. This will ensure reliance on US energy exports.\nThummel emphasized a focus on energy infrastructure companies while discussing his specific investment strategies as they tend to be stable and have high dividend yields even in uncertain market conditions. He thinks that the certainty provided by energy infrastructure investments in an otherwise volatile market should not be neglected. Such companies generate substantial annual cash flows while maintaining disciplined financial practices.\nThummel thinks that the energy sector trades at a discount to historical valuations despite its fundamentals. This offers the potential for high returns.\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top energy stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15 as of April 10. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nAn aerial view of an oil rig at sea, the sun glinting off its structure.\nForward P/E Ratio as of April 10: 12.92\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) engages in integrated energy and chemicals operations and operates in the Upstream and Downstream segments. The Upstream segment explores, develops, and produces crude oil and natural gas. The Downstream segment refines crude oil into petroleum products, markets crude oil, refined products, & lubricants, and manufactures & markets renewable fuels.\nIn 2024, the company’s Permian Basin operations exceeded expectations with production growth of about 18% compared to the year-ago period, which was another record for Permian production. Over the past 5 years, the company has delivered a CAGR of 16% in the Permian, which has been achieved through optimized pad and drilling designs, as well as completion improvements such as triple frac techniques.\nThis allows the company to reach these production levels with 40% fewer company-operated rigs than previously planned. Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) now expects Permian production to reach one million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025. The Permian portfolio delivers superior returns due to royalty-advantaged acreage across all sub-basins, which contributes to both the top and bottom lines.\nOverall, CVX ranks 3rd on our list of the best undervalued energy stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of CVX, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CVX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

The revision stems largely from slower-than-expected consumption and new U.S. tariffs that have rattled trade dynamics and economic sentiment globally. As President Trump ramps up tariff measures, including a 125% levy on Chinese imports, investors are growing increasingly wary about how this might dampen energy demand, particularly in emerging markets.Despite these geopolitical headwinds, oil prices remain relatively steady, with WTI crude hovering over $60 per barrel. However, volatility is high. Crude futures are down more than 10% so far this month, largely on fears that slowing global trade and rising supply will pressure prices. Against this backdrop, it may be wise for investors to adopt a more defensive approach—one that focuses on large, resilient players like Chevron CVX, ConocoPhillips COP, and EOG Resources EOG. These companies have the scale, balance sheets, and capital discipline to navigate turbulence, making them safer bets in uncertain times.\nOPEC’s cautious tone isn’t just based on oil-specific fundamentals. The group’s Monthly Oil Market Report also trimmed its global economic growth outlook for 2025 to 3.0%, from 3.1%, reflecting growing uncertainty in light of the ongoing trade tensions. The U.S. economy is forecasted to expand by 2.1% in 2025, while growth in the Eurozone and China is expected to slow to 0.8% and 4.6%, respectively. These projections imply weaker industrial activity and transport fuel demand—the key drivers of global oil consumption.OECD nations are forecast to contribute a mere 40,000 bpd to demand growth in 2025, while non-OECD countries, traditionally the growth engine, are expected to add around 1.25 million bpd. However, these numbers could fall if trade tensions and inflation continue to hurt energy use by consumers and businesses.\nOn the supply front, OPEC’s report showed that the broader OPEC+ group reduced output slightly in March, with total production falling by 37,000 bpd to 41.02 million bpd. Cuts from Nigeria and Iraq offset gains from Kazakhstan, which continues to exceed its output cap. However, OPEC+ is scheduled to increase output again in May, raising questions about how the additional barrels will be absorbed in a softer demand environment.Meanwhile, non-OPEC supply growth has also been revised down. OPEC now expects non-OPEC+ liquids production to rise by 900,000 bpd in 2025—100,000 bpd less than previously forecast. Most of this increase is still expected to come from the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. However, with U.S. shale growth slowing and cost inflation a growing concern, the global supply outlook looks slightly more balanced than a month ago.\nThe near-term outlook for oil is shaped by two opposing forces: weak demand growth weighed down by economic uncertainty and trade friction, versus constrained supply growth and OPEC+ discipline. While the trade war has clouded investor sentiment, the fundamentals don’t suggest a collapse. Air travel demand remains solid, road mobility is recovering, and oil use is still expected to grow, albeit at a slower pace.Moreover, OPEC’s view remains more optimistic than other forecasters. While Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have cut their demand forecasts sharply, OPEC still sees long-term demand trending higher, unlike the Paris-headquartered International Energy Agency (IEA), which anticipates a peak within the decade.For investors, the takeaway is clear: volatility is here to stay. But energy is still a vital part of the global economy, and demand isn’t going away—it’s just shifting. That’s why it’s smart to stick with strong, stable companies that generate solid cash flow.\nWith tariffs roiling markets and macro uncertainty clouding short-term outlooks, it’s prudent to hold on to proven, cash-generating energy stocks. Companies like Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and EOG Resources offer resilience and upside potential once the market regains clarity. OPEC’s latest report may signal a slower pace of demand growth, but it also confirms that oil is still very much a necessary commodity. In times like these, investors should stay patient, avoid chasing volatility, and lean on the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) names best equipped to ride out the storm.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Chevron: Chevron is well-run and historically a profitable big oil giant. Chevron’s upstream portfolio remains a key strength, with strong production growth from the Permian Basin and Kazakhstan. The company is targeting a 6% annual production increase through 2026, with high-margin projects driving long-term value. Chevron continues to be a strong dividend player, having increased its payout for 37 consecutive years. The latest dividend hike of 4.9% takes its yield to over 4%, making it a reliable income source for long-term investors.ConocoPhillips: Based on production and reserves, ConocoPhillips is among the leading upstream energy players in the United States. In 2024, COP produced a record 1,987 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day globally, thanks to its strong presence in the prolific low-cost resources in the U.S. Lower 48 and Alaska, along with Asia, Australia, Africa, Europe and Canada. ConocoPhillips, with a debt-to-capitalization of 27.3%, is also demonstrating its strong financials and is well-positioned to navigate the tariff-induced market uncertainty.EOG Resources: In the United States, EOG is among the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. As of year-end 2024, the firm reported total net proved developed reserves of 2,566 million barrels of oil equivalent. Despite the decline in oil prices, EOG’s operations in low-cost resources like the Delaware Basin, a sub-basin of the broader Permian and Eagle Ford shale play, are still profitable. EOG Resources also has a strong balance sheet that the upstream player can rely on to ride the current uncertain business environment. Notably, EOG Resources’ low debt-to-capitalization of 13.9% is considerably below the industry’s 51.4%.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other best oil stocks.\nAfter an encouraging start to the year, the energy sector is once again lagging behind the overall market. At the time of writing this piece, the broader energy sector has slid by almost 8.2% since the beginning of 2025, against declines of around 7.9% by the wider market. The principal reason behind this fall is the decline in the global prices of oil, which have plunged by almost 14.5% since the beginning of the year.\nREAD NEXT: 10 Best Clean Energy Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires\nThe continued uncertainty surrounding the ongoing tariff war and the recent decision by OPEC+ to increase supply in May have taken a toll on the global price, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price now hovering around a 3-year low of $61.5. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecasted WTI price to average $63.88 per barrel for 2025 before dropping to an average of $57.48 next year. Such a sharp decline in prices could threaten US oil production growth this year. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the US oil industry needs prices between $61 and $70 per barrel to be profitable.\nThe escalating trade tensions between the US and China have also raised the prospect of a global economic slowdown, potentially leading to a lower-than-forecasted consumption of oil. In its latest report, the EIA now expects global oil consumption to increase by 900,000 b/d in 2025 and 1 million b/d in 2026, down by 400,000 b/d and 100,000 b/d, respectively, from its initial forecast last month. The decrease in demand, coupled with increasing production, will continue putting pressure on crude prices, forcing many industry players to cut back activity to maintain investor payouts.\nThe American oil and gas sector is also frustrated by the back and forth trade policies of President Trump and is questioning how they align with his ‘drill, baby, drill’ mandate to further boost production. According to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, nearly a third of oil executives have stated that their business outlook has worsened since the end of 2024. Moreover, the imposition of the 25% tariff on steel and aluminum has already led to an estimated 4% increase in costs for drilling a well.\nThe pressing issues surrounding the global oil trade have forced the industry to shift focus to its second major source of revenue – natural gas. In contrast to oil, the benchmark US natural gas price at Henry Hub has surged by more than 123% since last year and by almost 18% since the beginning of 2025. The uptick comes as a result of slowing output in 2024, booming LNG exports, and fast-depleting inventories during the coldest winter in six years. Moreover, natural gas has emerged as a leading candidate to power the ongoing AI boom and its accompanying data centers, with many providers now even aiming to surpass utilities and supply directly to these power-hungry facilities.\nAlso, despite the broad concerns, many billionaires continue to invest and remain bullish on the oil sector. A great example is how Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway maintains significant holdings in multiple oil majors and even recently invested hundreds of millions of dollars in an oil and gas giant over the last few months.\nAn aerial view of an oil rig at sea, the sun glinting off its structure.\nTo collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of billionaires’ stock holdings and picked the top 10 companies operating in the oil sector with the highest number of billionaire investors in the Insider Monkey database in Q4 of 2024. When two or more companies had the same number of billionaires backing them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year. Following are the Best Oil Stocks According to Billionaires.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Billionaire Holders: 14\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) manufactures and sells a range of high-quality refined products, including gasoline, diesel, marine and aviation fuels, premium base oil, finished lubricants, and fuel oil additives. The oil and gas giant owns five US fuel refineries and boasts a network of Chevron and Texaco service stations.\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) narrowly missed earnings expectations in Q4 2024 as weak margins dragged its refining business into a loss for the first time in the last four years. However, the company increased its revenue by 10.7% YoY to $52.23 billion during the quarter, topping estimates as it increased its worldwide and US production by 7% and 19%, respectively, to record levels in 2024. CVX also maintains a robust balance sheet and generated $31.5 billion in operating cash flow and $15 billion in free cash flow in FY 2024, ending the year with a net debt ratio of 10%. The industry giant expects to maintain this momentum, expecting to add $10 billion of annual free cash flow in 2026 (assuming $70 oil) and around $9 billion at the current Brent price.\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is known for its commitment to shareholders, and the company returned a record $27 billion to its shareholders in 2024 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The company has returned over $75 billion to shareholders over the last three years and recently increased its quarterly dividend by 4.9% to $1.71 per share, maintaining a 38-year streak of consistent dividend growth.\nAs a result, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) was also included in our list of the 25 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires.\nOverall, CVX ranks 4th on our list of the best oil stocks to invest in according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of CVX to grow , our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

But oftentimes, the dividend yield on a stock might not be much to write home about. Many growth-focused companies don't pay dividends at all, which is why the yield on the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has fallen to just 1.4%. \nHowever, there are some companies that yield a considerable amount -- to the point where the dividend is a core part of the investment thesis. Stocks with reliable dividends and high yields can be excellent ways to collect passive income no matter what the broader market is doing.\nHere's why these three fool.com contributors think Chevron (CVX 0.65%), Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP -0.90%) (BEPC -1.05%), and MSC Industrial Direct (MSM -1.48%) are three high-yield dividend stocks to buy now.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nDaniel Foelber (Chevron): Chevron stock is hovering around a three-year low. The sell-off in the integrated oil major could be a phenomenal buying opportunity for income investors.\nThe company has raised its dividend for 38 consecutive years, an impressive track record considering multiple oil and gas downturns and recessions have occurred during that period. The sell-off in the stock has pushed its yield up to 4.8%, providing investors with the opportunity to generate sizable passive income.\nAnd Chevron has an excellent balance sheet that acts as a cushion in case of a prolonged oil and gas downturn. The company has used outsize profits in recent years to pay down debt and return cash to investors through buybacks and dividends. It has just $17.2 billion in net long-term debt and an ultra-low debt-to-capital ratio of just 13.6%, showcasing how its capital structure isn't dependent on debt.\nDespite its strengths, Chevron will probably generate a lot less free cash flow (FCF) if oil prices stay at lower levels (they are at their lowest level in four years). And although the company has reduced its cost of production over time, there comes a point when it can no longer support its dividend and capital-spending plans with cash.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nAt current oil prices, management will likely pull back on capital spending and buybacks, but it still has a margin for error considering 75% of its oil investments can break even below $50 per barrel. The company has been testing its new \"triple frac\" technology, which could reduce costs and cut completion times for new wells in the Permian Basin.\nAnother advantage of Chevron over other producers is its geographic diversification. It isn't dependent on one region and has a massive refining business and growing low-carbon segment.\nThe company has what it takes to generate positive FCF even at lower oil prices and support its growing dividend. In past downturns, it has pulled back on stock repurchases and spending but continued to support the dividend by leaning on its balance sheet.\nIf oil prices fall below $50 per barrel, many companies would be in dire straits. But the business has proved time and time again that investors can count on it for passive income even during downturns.\nAdd it all up, and Chevron is as safe a bet as you'll find in the oil patch.\nScott Levine (Brookfield Renewable Partners): With markets turning in topsy-turvy performances right now, many investors are eager for some stability. At the forefront of the many ways that they can gird themselves, buying reliable dividend stocks like green energy specialist Brookfield Renewable Partners is a savvy choice. The limited partnership currently offers an enticing 7.3% forward yield.\nProviding an ultra-high yield, Brookfield might spark doubt in investors who question whether the company can sustain its generous payout during the current market downturn. But that's the allure: With its stable business model, the company enjoys tremendous resilience during times like these.\nFrom solar to wind to other green energy assets, Brookfield Renewable Partners operates a massive global green energy portfolio -- about 46 gigawatts of operating capacity -- and it inks long-term deals with customers, which agree to purchase the generated power.\nThis model ensures that the company will continue generating revenue, and it will have the resources to continue rewarding investors. In its fourth-quarter 2024 financial results, for example, management noted that about 90% of the company's generation capacity is contracted, and about 70% of its revenue is protected from inflation.\nIn its relatively short time as a publicly held company, it has demonstrated steadfast dedication to returning capital to investors, further illustrating its appeal. Every year since its initial public offering in 2011, the company has hiked its dividend by at least 5%. Regarding the years ahead, management has stated a goal of continuing to boost its dividend 5% to 9% annually.\nFor income-hungry investors, now's a great time to buy Brookfield Renewable Partners' stock, which is currently trading at a discount to its historical valuation.\nLee Samaha (MSC Industrial Direct): It's incredibly challenging to know whether the White Houe tariffs are tactical (to aid trade-deal negotiations) or strategic (to engineer a long-term structural shift in the global economy), but it's probably true to think they are a bit of both.\nHowever, one thing we do know with a high degree of certainty is that President Donald Trump, one way or another, wants to see the U.S. rebuild its industrial base. That could be great news for metalworking supply company MSC Industrial.\nReaders should be under no illusions: If the current uncertainty persists, there's a serious risk of an industrial recession, and MSC Industrial will inevitably suffer the consequences.\nHowever, the long-term outlook is brighter, as a shift in manufacturing back to the U.S. implies an improving environment for metalworking suppliers. The company has negative exposure to tariffs via 10% of its cost of goods sold from China, with a similar amount from Europe, and low-single-digit percentages from Canada and Mexico.\nOn a positive note, distributors like MSC will try to pass on the tariff increases in pricing. In any case, most of its products are sourced in the U.S. All told, if you are confident that the global economy will avoid a recession and that the president's determination to reinvigorate the industrial base will work, then MSC Industrial is a good choice for long-term investors.\nJust be aware that the near-term risk is rising while companies set about reshaping their supply chains and product sourcing.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chevron wasn’t one of them.

The blocks across five sedimentary basins, including the deepwater Potiguar and Foz do Amazonas, located near the equator, will also be offered, which are considered to hold Brazil’s greatest potential for replenishing reserves and are projected to start declining by 2030.\nOut of the 172 oil blocks, 47 are at the Foz do Amazonas, where Petrobras, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold),won the exploration deal in 2023 and since then, has been awaiting environmental clearance to drill its first well. These oil blocks are expected to contain the same potential as those in Suriname and Guyana, where Exxon Mobil found billions of barrels of oil. The delay in environmental clearance certainly reduces the attractiveness of these blocks for the auction.\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nCertain environmental working groups have suggested dropping some Potiguar Basin oil blocks, like Atol das Rocas and the Fernando de Noronha archipelago as they are in places of extreme environmental sensitivity and ecosystem connectivity.\nHowever, Brazil’s several ministries jointly allowed these sensitive areas to be offered for auction, even though this authorization expires just a day after the auction. This puts the Potiguar Basin at particular risk of exclusion from future rounds.\nDespite the controversies, the auction has attracted interest from the industry’s big players. Thirty-one companies have registered themselves to bid for the upcoming auction, including Petrobras, Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM, Chevron Corporation CVX, BP p.l.c. BP,Shell and Equinor.\nExxon Mobil is a U.S.-based oil and gas giant that has a track record of optimal capital structure and Capex discipline across the commodity price cycle, making it a low-risk energy player producing industry-leading returns. XOM’s expected growth rate for earnings per share for the next year is 21.88%, which aligns favorably with the industry growth rate of 16.30%.\nHouston, TX-based Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companiesthat participates in every aspect related to energy,from oil production to refining and marketing. CVX generates more than $200 billion in annual revenues and produces over three million barrels per day of oil equivalent. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVX’s 2025 earnings indicates 2.49% year-over-year growth.\nBP, an integrated oil and gas company, is driven by its strategic shift toward traditional and renewable energy. BP plans to reduce debt and strengthen its balance sheet while prioritizing shareholder returns by generating proceeds from asset sales.

The Permian Basin has become a linchpin for both as they sharpen their focus on scalable, high-return assets. Each company is doubling down on this prolific region serving as a key source of cash flow, but their paths diverge in strategy and execution.\nAccording to the Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), U.S. crude oil production, largely driven by the Permian, is expected to reach 13.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2025 and 13.6 million bpd in 2026. With Permian output set to grow by 290,000 bpd this year from 2024 and an additional 170,000 bpd in 2026, the region will account for nearly half of the nation’s oil supply, solidifying its role in the energy market. This surge in production is backed by record-breaking rig efficiency, robust infrastructure and continued investments in drilling innovations, ensuring long-term sustainability and profitability for key players in the basin.\nChevron holds 1.78 million net acres in the Delaware and Midland sub-basins of Texas and New Mexico, making it one of the largest leaseholders in the Permian. It boosts efficiency by drilling several horizontal wells from a single site, a method known as factory-style development. In 2024, Chevron’s average daily output from the Permian basin stood at 405,000 barrels of oil, 251,000 barrels of NGLs, and 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas.Chevron aims to reach 1 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (BOE/d) in 2025 and is already close, producing 992,000 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2024. With layered rock formations, upgraded infrastructure, and sustainability steps like using electric fleets and solar energy, Chevron’s strategy focuses on both growth and reducing environmental impact.Meanwhile, ExxonMobil has aggressively ramped up its Permian presence through acquisitions — most notably its $63 billion buyout of Pioneer Natural Resources in 2024. This move expanded Exxon’s footprint to more than 1.3 million net acres and significantly boosted output. In 2024, ExxonMobil’s Permian production averaged 1.185 million BOE/d, up 570,000 from the prior year. The company plans to double that to 2.3 million BOE/d by 2030. To get there, it’s using advanced methods like special proppants and cube drilling, and it aims to cut emissions to net zero in its original Permian operations by 2030 and in Pioneer’s by 2035.\nChevron leans on a disciplined capital allocation model, emphasizing cost control and asset returns. It supplements operated activity with joint ventures and royalty interests to balance risk and capital intensity. In particular, Chevron’s use of royalty interests allows it to benefit from production upside without committing large amounts of capital. On the other hand, ExxonMobil is leaning heavily into scale and integration. ExxonMobil, on the other hand, is integrating scale through acquisitions and focusing on operational synergies. Its Pioneer deal gave it high-quality, contiguous acreage, which is expected to support production growth at lower costs. Both companies are aligning their Permian strategies with broader low-carbon goals but are taking slightly different paths to get there.\nOver the past six months, Chevron has outperformed ExxonMobil despite both stocks being weighed down by trade-related uncertainty and new U.S. tariffs. The market has been jittery amid fears that steep levies could dent global demand.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nChevron’s valuation remains attractive, too. It trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 5.55, which is more favorable compared to ExxonMobil. This suggests better value for investors focused on cash flow and capital discipline.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLooking ahead, Chevron appears better positioned in terms of earnings momentum. The Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for a 2.9% decline in its 2025 EPS, followed by a strong 23.1% rebound in 2026.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn contrast, ExxonMobil is projected to see a steeper 10.5% decline this year, with a 21.1% recovery anticipated in 2026. The near-term outlook for ExxonMobil remains more uncertain, weighed down by integration costs from recent acquisitions and ongoing inflationary pressures. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile both Chevron and ExxonMobil are deeply invested in the Permian Basin and share a commitment to scale and lower emissions, Chevron currently holds the upper hand. It combines consistent execution with financial discipline and a clear path toward its production goals. While CVX holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it stands on firmer ground than XOM, which holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). For now, Chevron looks better placed to navigate market headwinds and deliver stable, long-term shareholder value.

(C) slashed their estimates for 2025 earnings as companies kick off their first-quarter reports, joining a wave of Wall Street banks warning that tariffs will curb profit growth.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Secret Formula for Faster Trains\nNYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six\nEven Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem\nInside the Quiet, Extravagant Expansion of the Frick Collection\nLisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City’s Housing Shortage\nCiti’s head of US equity strategy, Scott Chronert lowered his 2025 prediction for the S&P 500 to 5,800 from 6,500, predicated on earnings of $255 a share for companies in the index, down from a previous $270 projection. At Morgan Stanley, Mike Wilson cut his 2025 earnings-per-share forecast to $257 from $271.\n“The 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs and further concessions over the weekend lessen the near-term probability of a recession, but uncertainty remains high,” said Wilson, who sees the S&P 500 trading in a range from 5,000-5,500. The index finished last week at 5,363.36.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) has fallen 8.8% this year on concern that investors increasingly are shifting away from US assets. The selloff was worsened by Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs policy and the tit-for-tat spat with China. Investors are rushing to game out how the effective freezing of Chinese trade will impact companies and growth.\nMorgan Stanley’s Wilson warned that the S&P 500 could slump back below 5,000 and retest last week’s lows if 10-year Treasuries yields surge above 5% from the current 4.46%. A larger trade deal with China that significantly reduces tariffs still in place would cause significant upside, he said.\nRead: ‘No Place to Hide’ as Stress Spreads Across Assets: Taking Stock\nThe first signs of a slowdown in global trade are already emerging as companies around the world hit their own pause button on orders. If anything, Trump is extending the uncertainty that has already begun to drag on business and consumer sentiment.\n“No doubt, the goldilocks sentiment in place entering this year has given way to abject uncertainty,” Chronert wrote in a note. “This is for good reason as the Trump administration’s announced tariff approach is set to disrupt” a global trade system that has developed since China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001.\nCompanies’ attempts to pass through tariff-driven price increases threaten the US consumers’ incomes, who’s spending power has already been sapped by post-pandemic inflation.\nWhile a recession is not their base case, the probability for a mild one remains high, according to Chronert and Wilson.\nSome impacts are already visible. Delta Air Lines Inc. withdrew its full-year financial guidance due to uncertainty surrounding global trade last week.\nIn a difficult environment, Wilson recommends looking for opportunities in industries where prices already reflect the risks, including transports, materials, semiconductors, autos and pharma/biotech as well as hardware, while leaning towards bearish bets in areas such as consumer discretionary and staples stocks.\n—With assistance from Michael Msika.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nWorld Travelers Are Rethinking Vacation Plans to the US\nHow One MBA Grad Blew the Whistle on a $2 Billion Deal\nCheap Consumer Goods Are the American Dream, Actually\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's \n                        \n                            Terms\n                        \n                     and \n                        \n                            Privacy Policy\n                        \n\nIs McDonald's strong growth strategy enough to overcome near-term challenges?

It was a strong quarter for the company, with a decent beat of analysts’ adjusted operating income and EPS estimates. It reported 64.46 billion revenue passenger miles, up 6.3% year on year.\nIs United Airlines a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it’s free.\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting United Airlines’s revenue to grow 4.7% year on year to $13.13 billion, slowing from the 9.7% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.74 per share.\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings.

Given the current uncertain scenario, DAL decided against reaffirming its 2025 financial guidance.\nJetBlue Airways JBLU was also in the news due to its decision to add two nonstop routes to expand its service at Fort Lauderdale. Mexican carrier Controladora Vuela Compañía de Aviación VLRS or Volaris reported a year-over-year increase in revenue passenger miles (RPMs: a measure of air traffic) for March.\nDriven by the increase in international operations, Latin American carrier LATAM Airlines Group LTM reported a year-over-year increase in revenue passenger-kilometers (RPK: a measure of air traffic) for March. Alaska Airlines, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group ALK, was also in the news due to its decision to invest in Loft Dynamics, a company specializing in virtual flight training. Through this move, Alaska Air aims to revolutionize pilot training.\nRead the last Airline Roundup here.\n1.  Delta reported first-quarter 2025 earnings (excluding 9 cents from non-recurring items) of 46 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents. Earnings increased 2.2% on a year-over-year basis due to low fuel costs. Revenues in the March-end quarter were $14.04 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.81 billion and increasing 2.1% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted operating revenues (excluding third-party refinery sales) increased 3.3% year over year to $13 billion.\nDelta expects second-quarter 2025 adjusted earnings per share in the $1.7-$2.3 range. The adjusted operating margin is expected in the 11-14% band. Revenues on an adjusted basis are expected to be down 2% to up 2% year over year.\nDAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n2. In response to customer demand, JetBlue has decided to resume service between Fort Lauderdale and Philadelphia and between Fort Lauderdale and Guayaquil, Ecuador, beginning this summer. Flights connecting Fort Lauderdale and Philadelphia will operate twice daily from July 3. Meanwhile, flights between Fort Lauderdale and Guayaquil will operate once a day from July 17. Flights on both routes will be operated by JetBlue’s Airbus A320 aircraft, equipped with all modern facilities.\nThese new routes build on JetBlue’s continued investment in South Florida, where the low-cost airline has increased departures by 6% year over year. The resumption of the two routes highlights JetBlue’s commitment to meeting customer demand and seizing strategic opportunities. These routes were paused during a broader network optimization.\n3. For March, Volaris reported a 10.9% year-over-year increase in consolidated capacity (measured in available seat miles). The load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) decreased 2.4 percentage points to 84.4% on a consolidated basis. The metric fell as the increase in consolidated traffic (7.8%) was less than the increase in consolidated capacity. During the month, Volaris transported 2.6 million passengers, up 12.3% year over year.\nOn the domestic front, revenue per mile (RPM) and available seat miles (ASMs) increased 9.9% and 13.3%, respectively, from March 2024 levels. The domestic load factor in March was 89.4%, a decrease of 2.8 percentage points from year-ago levels. In international markets, RPM increased 4.6% year over year, while ASM rose 7.6% year over year.\n4. For March, LATAM Airlines reported a 7.2% year-over-year increase in consolidated capacity, measured in available seat kilometers. LTM’s revenue passenger kilometers increased 5.6% year over year despite the impact of the carnival holidays on Brazil’s domestic segment. The carnival took place in the month of March in 2025, whereas it was celebrated in February in 2024, affecting year-over-year comparability. Although traffic improved on a year-over-year basis, it failed to outpace capacity expansion. As a result, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) fell to 81.9% from 83.9% a year ago.\n5. In a bid to revolutionize pilot training by leveraging extended reality technology, Alaska Air took a stake in Loft Dynamics, which is headquartered in Zürich, Switzerland, with an office in Santa Monica, CA. Through this investment, made through Alaska Star Ventures, ALK intends to develop the first hyper-realistic, full-motion Boeing 737 virtual reality simulator.\nThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe NYSE ARCA Airline Index increased by 2.6% to $59.58 as most airline stocks traded in the green over the past week. The upside followed President Donald Trump's announcement that he would pause the reciprocal import taxes for 90 days. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has decreased 16.5%.\nAmid the tariff-induced uncertainties, first-quarter 2025 earnings reports of many airlines are expected in the coming days. For example, Alaska Air is scheduled to report quarterly results on April 23. While its top line is likely to have been hurt by the slowdown in domestic air travel demand, the bottom line is expected to have been boosted by reduced fuel costs.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Read Investopedia's live coverage of today's market action here.)\n\n In March, three of the largest U.S. airlines—Delta Air Lines (DAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), and American Airlines (AAL)—had dropped projections for the first quarter of the year, citing weakening travel demand amid worries about the economy.\n\n Delta CEO Ed Bastian said last week that people are “acting as if we're going [into] a recession,” and the airline withdrew its full-year guidance.\n\n The demand warning from airlines hit travel stocks across the booking industry, including hotels and cruise lines.

It was a tough month all around, as 98 of the S&P 500 stocks finished the month down at least 10%, but two especially had a bad month: Delta Air Lines (DAL -0.47%) and United Airlines (UAL -0.01%). Delta and United were the S&P 500's worst-performing stocks in March, falling 27.5% and 26.4%, respectively.\n\n^SPX data by YCharts\nBroader economic uncertainty took its toll on both companies, but there were also industry-specific problems that caused the stock price drops. Delta lowered its revenue growth guidance from 6%-8% down to 5% (at the higher end). It also cut its earnings-per-share (EPS) guidance from $0.70 to $1 down to $0.30 to $0.50.\nUnited also lowered its guidance as it projects its revenue will take a hit. It noted a slowdown in corporate and government travel, especially as the federal government focuses on reducing its spending. United says government-related booking decreased by half.\nAs new tariff plans go into effect and concerns about inflation and a potential recession ramp up, both companies could face some near-term troubles as consumers, companies, and governments cut back on travel. It will take time to see how it all plays out, but investors should expect volatility to continue along with potential drops.\nAs of market closing on April 11, Delta's and United's stocks are down 30.8% and 31.3% for the year, respectively.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Delta Air Lines, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Delta Air Lines wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool money starts now.\nFrom fool Global headquarters. This is Motley Fool Money. It's the Motley Fool Money Radio Show. I'm Ron Gross sitting in for Dylan Lewis. Joining me today, our senior analyst, Emily Flippen and Matt Argersinger fools, how you doing?\nMatt Argersinger: Ron.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nEmily Flippen: Doing all right.\nMatt Argersinger: Doing all right.\nRon Gross: Glad to hear it. Today, we're going to talk banks and assorted spirits, but we must, once again, begin with the big macro and, oh, boy, what a week it has been following several very rough days in the stock market, on Wednesday, the Trump administration put a 90-day pause on its so-called reciprocal tariff policy, sending the market soaring for its biggest one day gain since 2008. Then, on Thursday, inflation data came in tamer than expected and just for good measure, on Thursday, we saw another sell-off in stocks. Emily, I am truly exhausted. But let's dig in. Where are we now from an economic markets perspective? I know you don't have a crystal ball, but where do you think we're going?\nEmily Flippen: If financial media has anything to say about it, it's straight to hell on a handbasket here for American consumers and investors. I'm teasing here because I really don't necessarily think that is going to be the case. While we still have a lot of economic data that is not coming out as favorably as I think some investors want, and that's leading to some of that volatility we're seeing in the market, the earlier inflation metrics that we got earlier this week, we're actually very encouraging. It was a sign that some of the concerns that I think we had around stagflation may be coming down a bit. Now, that is the core PPI, the producer price index that excludes food and energy, but it's the Fed's favored inflation metric here. That actually fell nominally month over month.\nAnd it wasn't just a matter of, Okay, this is lower than expected, but still rising inflation, but an actual month-over-month decline here. Of course, if we add food and energy, the story changes. But this is a little bit of a silver lining that I think investors need to say, OK, we have a lot of data that's pointing in the wrong direction right now. Here is something that continues to say, it may not be as bad as we expect. But of course, the emphasis is, of course, on this was the case. Inflation metrics are a lagging indicator. We're always forward-looking. Some of the policies that we've seen since this data has come out over the course of the past month, I think, are pretty clearly indicating that inflation is expected to heat up substantially. But I'll take this when for this week.\nRon Gross: What about from the markets? Do you think the markets are just nervous, don't like uncertainty? That's what we typically say. Markets hate uncertainty, and there's so much uncertainty around here nowadays. Do you think that's why we're seeing the volatile the big sharp moves?\nEmily Flippen: I don't think it's just uncertainty. I think there's genuine concern about the business impacts that these tariffs, if they stay in place, will have both on companies that are supplying, manufacturing, as well as consumers looking to make purchases. This has wide-ranging implications for the performance of the broader economy as a whole. It's not just a matter of uncertainty because I think if we came out tomorrow and said, Okay, we are certain, 100% sure. The tariffs, as they are today, are going to stick this way for the next 12 months for certain, for example. That would be certainty. But I'll tell you what, I bet the stock market would sell off.\nRon Gross: Oh. Understood. Matt, US consumer sentiment is now worse than during the Great Recession. New data just came out. Anything here for an individual investor to do other than sit back and just watch it unfold?\nMatt Argersinger: Sitting back is very good advice. Watching it unfold, I don't know. You're better off just turning everything off and maybe going away for a week. But look, we're investors. I know that's impossible. It's definitely impossible for me. But here's what I think if you're an investor, what you can or should pay attention to, and that is interest rates. The Trump administration only really blinked this past week when the 10 yield crossed about 4.5%. But guess where we are today as we tape on Friday, back above 4.5%, Ron. If you go back to April 2nd, which was Liberation Day, as the administration called it, the 10-year was just above 4%. We're up 50 basis points in a week, and that's through all this market dislocation. It usually doesn't work that way. Usually, investors are buying treasuries as a safe haven during times like this. That's just not happening right now and I think that is where the real danger lies, and I think Emily hinted at this.\nI mean, if countries like China and, Japan UK, various members of the EU stop buying our treasuries, either because they're exporting less as a result of these tariffs, and they don't have as many US dollars to invest anyway, or much worse, guys, they willfully decide to stop buying treasuries in favor of other safe-haven assets or currencies. I mean, just look at the Swiss franc as of the past week. If that happens, it will almost certainly send treasury yields much higher. And I think that would spell huge trouble for the housing market, which we already know is suffering from high mortgage rates. Imagine mortgage rates not at six or 7% as they are now, but 8, 9, 10%. I think it also spells big trouble for small, midsize businesses who don't have as much flexibility with their balance sheets and where they source their products. It's bad for auto manufacturers, bad for commercial real estate and then to consumers to Emily's point. Consumers are sitting on record credit card debt and if interest rates move higher that situation gets a lot worse. I think it really could mean bad news for the economy. If you're going to watch anything at all, sit back and watch this shake out, watch treasury yields. If they keep moving higher, I expect that could trigger a response by the administration. To be less aggressive with these tariffs, maybe come to the table, that'll be the trigger point.\nRon Gross: I was going to say one silver lining may be we do have anecdotal evidence that the administration does keep an eye on the bond market, and on interest rates, that could very well be the reason we got the 90 day pause. We don't necessarily have proof of that, but that certainly could be. I would encourage them to keep an eye on the yields, so we don't get into too much trouble, as you outlined. But speaking of interest rates, on Friday, many of the larger banks reported pretty solid results for the first quarter, and Matt, lots of data, plenty of commentary from the CEOs. What's set out to you in these reports?\nMatt Argersinger: Results you said, Ron, the results were actually really solid. The problem is no one really cares about that right now. It's really all about guidance and how these CEOs are thinking about the environment, post tariffs, post-liberation Day and what they see going forward. Here's what they're saying. If you look at CEO Jamie Diamond, CEO of the largest US bank, JP Morgan, he's been pretty vocal this past week about the dangers of tariffs, even saying he believes that a recession is all but unavoidable now. And then he said this after his bank reported quarter results, \"The economy is facing considerable turbulence, potential negatives of tariffs and trade wars,\" ongoing sticking inflation, high fiscal deficits, and still rather high asset prices and volatilities.\nWhat else he said? Wells Fargo's CEO, Charlie Sharf, \"We support the administration's willingness to look at barriers to fair trade to the United States. Though there are certainly risks associated with such significant actions, a timely resolution, which benefits the US, would be good for businesses, consumers, and the markets. We expect continued volatility and uncertainty and are prepared for a slower economic environment in 2025\" Then Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, which I think is now the world's largest ass manager, \"The sweeping tariff announcements went further than I could have imagined in my 49 years in finance.\" Then in an interview on CNBC, he also said, \"I think we're very close if not in a recession now,\" talking about, of course, the US economy.\nRon Gross: Thanks for cheering us up, Matt.\nMatt Argersinger: Well, there you go. Let me sum it up, too. These tarifs are dangerous. If not resolved quickly, the risks are high, expect continued uncertainty, which we keep talking about, and we may already be in a recession. Remember, these are the banks and financial institutions that have a pulse, I think, in a lot of areas of the economy, which is from housing to credit, consumer spending. Wait until we start hearing from industrial companies or consumer discretionary companies, especially those that make and sell products all around the world. What will be their reactions and guidance when they report in the coming weeks? I think this is just the first Salvo, and it's sobering when you look at it, in terms of what they're seeing.\nRon Gross: On Wednesday, Constellation Brands reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations, but a week full-year earnings outlook that focused on the impact of, yes, tariffs was the focus. Emily, how did the quarter look to you? Is it possible for us to remove tariffs from this conversation and focus on the business, or they are so intertwined, just can't do that.\nEmily Flippen: I actually think that tariffs are maybe the least interesting thing happening to Constellation Brands business today. I understand why the narrative was around tariffs. It's like you can open up an Internet browser without being slapped across the face with news about tariffs and how they're going to be impacting companies. Certainly, Constellation Brands did say in the quarter that they're expecting a low single-digit increase in their total cost of goods that's associated with the tariffs and sourcing, of course, aluminum cans and other bottling items for the beers and the accessories, I'll say, for the wine and spirits business that they sell. But all of this stuff is happening to Constellation Brands. Meanwhile, Constellation Brands as a business itself, is actually doing a pretty decent job of a turnaround, especially considering the overall beer market. I think it's a disappointment that there's not more discussion around how strong this business has been in an incredibly weak environment for alcohol sales.\nIf you compare their performance against other large beer makers, Boston Beer, with Sam Adams being a great example, which has seen declining depletions, declining shipments, declining profitability and sales, Constellation Brands is growing and growing pretty solidly because the beer brands that it is continuing to focus on just have continued to resonate with a consumer that's a little bit more niche, that is a bit more loyal, and that has led to pretty incredible market share gains really consistently for this company in otherwise weak environment. I love that Constellation Brands has performed so well. I'm disappointed that the narrative is, Oh, no, that small single-digit increase associated with the tariffs. But I actually think fast forwarding five years from now, we're probably looking at a better business than today.\nRon Gross: They're selling some of their wine brands, Cooks, Miomi, that a good movie? You like that?\nEmily Flippen: I do. They're actually almost entirely divesting of their wine and spirits business. And if you look at their performance on earnings per share, non-adjusted basis for the quarter, you'll see the impact of that nearly $3 billion in goodwill write-offs associated with the sale of that business, which has been an underperformer for them for a while. That is obviously a ding on them. Some of the investments this company has made historically just haven't panned out. But they're really focusing on cost energies right now and focusing on what works, which is obviously the Corona, the Medello, the Pacificos. Those have an audience that are way more loyal than not to be offensive to Miomi, which I love their wine is a bit more loyal.\nRon Gross: Coming up, we'll talk airlines, building materials, and used cars. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\n...\nRon Gross: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ron Gross here with Emily Flippen and Matt Argersinger. On Wednesday, Delta reported that revenue growth stalled a bit in the first quarter and the company did not reaffirm its full year guidance, citing headwinds from the economic uncertainty around global trade. Matt, seems to me it wasn't the quarterly results, but the lack of full year guidance that spooked investors. Shares were up big on Wednesday as Trump paused tariffs, but the stock got smacked on Thursday as investors continued to digest what it all means. As I asked Emily with constellation, I'd love to strip out the economic noise here and talk about the business. Can we do that?\nMatt Argersinger: Well, let's try, Ron. It was actually a record quarter for Delta in terms of revenue. Pretty surprising, revenue was up 3.3% year over year, 13 billion, and growth was particularly strong in the premium segment of the business. So first class, business class, revenue there was up 7% year over year. International revenue was also pretty strong, and even corporate revenue was higher year over year, and Delta generated 1.3 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, paid down about 500 million in long term debt. All fairly positive and aligned with what CEO Ed Bastian said near the beginning of the year, which was that 2025 was going to be Delta's best financial year in our history. That is not really working out.\nRon Gross: Maybe not so much.\nMatt Argersinger: Because even if you go back a month ago, Delta had actually guided for 6-8% revenue growth this quarter. That's a big comedown from that. According to Bastion, things actually started to slow back in February. Well, before these tariff announcements or any hint of them, the company slashed its first quarter forecast. It did maintain its full year outlook back then, though. As you mentioned, Ron, that has now changed. They're not reaffirming that year outlook anymore. The company has pulled its guidance. It's still expecting to be profitable this year, but a far cry from where the company thought things would be coming into the year. I think you have to worry a lot about the state of the consumer here. What travel demand is going to look like, say, over the next 6-9 months, you mentioned the consumer sentiment numbers at the top of the show. One thing that's got to be helping Delta a little bit, though, over the past week is the fall in energy prices that we've seen. It's a big cost input for every airline including Delta. That will undoubtedly help Delta's margins and probably help the company remain profitable for the year if not growing.\nRon Gross: On Thursday, CarMax reported worse than expected fourth quarter results, and while it said it was making progress toward its financial goals, it will remove the timelines associated with them due to the potential impact of broader macro factors. Emily, I know I sound like a broken record here, but the macro environment is hard to escape. Do your best. Tell me how CarMax's business is doing.\nEmily Flippen: I actually think the business is doing a lot better than people expect, especially, again, given the narrative right now. I understand that the market is in part selling off CarMax for a few different factors. Of course, one aspect of the tariff implication for CarMax and any other business that is operating in the auto parts industry is that the used car parts that it needs in order to fix and resell vehicles on its platform, those are likely to increase, and that's likely to hurt margins at least in that narrow perspective. There's also an element of, Okay, used car prices are likely to increase with the tariffs as well, and that could hurt demand for used cars.\nThat could certainly pride some people out of market, and management was so uncertain of this environment that they did pull that guidance for vehicle sales, which is concerning to investors adding to the uncertainty. You can make the logical argument there for the interim of like, Okay, I understand what's happening here to CarMax. But I actually think that a little bit longer term, taking it one step further, we're likely to see similarly to what we saw during the pandemic that used car prices are likely to go up and that could price some people out of the market. But it's actually a boon for a lot of leaders in this space like CarMax, when the prices of used cars go up, especially in comparison to something like a new vehicle 'cause a new vehicles will also increase making used cars look relatively more attractive for consumers who can make a purchase plus higher cost means higher fees for CarMax. All of that is to say, I actually think they could make up some of the margin here, and the future may not be as negative for CarMax as some investors are pricing in today.\nRon Gross: All things considered, does CarMax go on your radar or you still go away?\nEmily Flippen: If I had a radar stock this month that I thought was an attractive value that I could make a 22nd, 32nd pitch for it, CarMax would certainly be up there. Digging into it this morning and in preparation for our show here, it reminded me this is an incredibly strong, profitable company, market share leader with a lot of tailwinds if you're willing to hold and overlook some of the near term uncertainty.\nRon Gross: Sounds good. On Tuesday, RPM International reported fiscal third quarter results that came in weaker than expected, and the maker of Deglo and Rustleum blamed unfavorable weather conditions and said that sales would be flat in the fourth quarter. Matt, RPM does a lot of business overseas, so it's got the trade situation plus the weather to contend with. How the quarter look to you, and does it tell us anything about industrial activity in general?\nMatt Argersinger: Well, lots of headwinds for RPM and lots of headwinds in general for industrial activity, even coming into this quarter and all the tariff news. Really two big challenges for them. They had record results last year in last year's fiscal third quarter, so comparisons are tough. But weather was a big problem in the quarter. If you don't know RPM, they serve primarily in the construction industry, and in much of the country, you had a fairly lengthy winter and then a lot of unusual storm activity in the south and the West, which really affected them. Slow housing market also continues to have an impact. That's been a story for a few years now. Until that picks up, RPM's consumer business is really going to struggle. Sales were down 3% overall. Pre tax operating profits, this is a business with high operating leverage we're down around 30%. With regard to tariffs, though, the good news for RPM is that they tend to be fairly insulated. For the most part, the company manufactures products in the countries or regions where it sells them. They do small amount of cross border activity. It sounds like a situation for RPM, where sales may be slightly down for the year with lower margins, but here is something, Ron, you and Emily can be excited about. RPM is acquiring the pink stuff.\nRon Gross: The pink.\nMatt Argersinger: Which I'm sure, if you've ever done an industrial cleaning of a bathroom, you've definitely use or at least should use. So the pink stuff joins other cleaning products within RPM's portfolio, including Crud Cutter, Mean Green, and Contobum, if I'm pronouncing that correctly. That guy sounds like the 1927 Yankees when it comes to cleaning portfolio lineup.\nRon Gross: I love it. Alright, fools. We'll see you a little bit later in the show. Up next, an interview with Martin de los Santos. He's the CFO of Mercado Libre, E-commerce giant and the largest company in Latin America. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\nWelcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ron Gross. Molly Fool senior analyst Asit Sharma caught up with Martin de los Santos, the CFO of Mercado Libre, a few weeks ago at our Market Volatility Summit. In this clip, you'll hear how Mercado Libre became resilient in the long term opportunities for Meli. Motley Fool members can access the full interview and replays from the event at live.fool.com.\nAsit Sharma: Martin, I wanted to start. Just looking at this company in general, Mercado Libre has such a history of dealing with formidable challenges from hyperinflation and geopolitical events within Latin America to providing fintech and lending services to populations that often are new to the banking and credit systems. What makes Mercado Libre such a resilient business?\nMartin de los Santos: Yes, we were founded back in '99, and we turned 25 years in 2024. With those 25 years, as you can imagine, in Latin America, operating in 19 different countries, we've seen it all. Things going sour very rapidly. Maybe Mezuela as an example, hyperinflation in Argentina, then things coming back as we are seeing it today, Brazil, Mexico. I think we went through a lot during those years. I would highlight a couple of things. First, we operate in commerce and Fintech in a region where there's a lot to be done in those two fronts. Production of commerce continues to be very low compared to other places. We are riding a secular trend of people moving online. The same with Fintech, I think the banks have done a really poor job of including financially, most of the population in Latin America, so that generates an opportunity for us. That's one thing. I will also highlight the culture of the company.\nOur CEO, our chairman continues to be Marcos Galbrin, who was the founder of the company. Not only him, a lot of people were with him at the beginning continues to be with the company. We have a very strong culture of entrepreneurship, willingness to take risks. Many times in the history of our company, we have to reinvent ourselves or take big bets, and that's a big part of our success, a culture of excellence, execution, bringing good talent, teamwork internally while competing because we operating in very competitive markets to the outside. I think I would say that we operate in a region that has tremendous opportunities, both commerce and Fintech, and we also have a culture of executing and operating in Latin America that has helped us to be resilient and to be successful in this. Latin America, we came from being a start-up of five people in the garage 25 years ago to last year we became the most valuable company in Latin America, and we have done that I think by culture and execution and the quality of people that we brought into our team.\nAsit Sharma: I liked one thing that you mentioned between the culture and the execution, which is the ability to take a risk, to take those big bets. How are things different now that you sit in the chair of a CFO to make sure that the bets have a commensurate payoff for the risk and also maybe in some cases to be the person who's encouraging the company to take those risks?\nMartin de los Santos: It's not only my role. I think it's the role of the senior management team. We keep on thinking about the trade off between growth and profitability. In fact, we have a name for that within Meli we call it grow fit because we operating many different verticals have tremendous growth opportunities, but at the same time, they require investments. If you look at the history of the past five, six years, we improve significantly the profitability of our business. While at the same time, we continue to deliver very high growth in both in commerce, Fintech, advertising at the different verticals. However, when we look forward, we don't shy away from investing, even if in the short term, that might put some pressure on margins because the main thing for us is to make sure that we do capture those opportunities that we had ahead of us and not necessarily to maximize short term profits. We do have a long term perspective on the business, but that's a trade off that we do it all the time, deciding where to invest and sacrifice a little bit of margins to capture opportunities in the future, and the whole company and the whole senior management team is thinking in those terms. Then it does risk taking, I think it's the nature of our business.\nYou mentioned I used to run the credit business, which we started back in 2017. That's probably the ultimate one that you need to manage and to deal with risk, and we're very cautious in the way we manage that risk. But in other cases in the history of our company, maybe 15 years ago, we took a big bet on adapting our platform to mobile, and that required lot of risk and a mindset of really changing the way we were doing things. If we didn't do that, we wouldn't have a company today. Ten years ago, we started with logistics, which is critical for e-commerce solution. If you think about it ten years ago, we didn't touch one single package. Today, last year, we have 1.8 billion packages delivered through our own fulfillment infrastructure or logistic infrastructure. I think those type of beds that when you need to do when you need to take risk and make sure that you invest behind the long term growth opportunities, that's what differentiates mainly from other companies that might not be willing to take those risks.\nAsit Sharma: I wanted to ask you about some overall metrics that you use as you look at the business. I used to work for a company where while we had so many drill down metrics, the owner would come in every day, and he said, I just need one number to run this business. Now, that wasn't true. You need more than one number to run a business. But it taught me something that people like yourself often Kean on a few metrics almost on a daily basis. How do you gauge the health of Mercado Libre from day to day?\nMartin de los Santos: Yeah, we are a very data oriented company. Business reviews that are so deep in terms of analysis and data that is true. It's hard to keep up with all the businesses. It's very complex Mercado Libre today. So it's important to have some, big picture views, and then you can drill down whenever you see something that we want to go into more detail. Many different businesses, 19 different countries. You can imagine that the metrics are hundreds. But I would say that obviously, top line metric GMB on our commerce business is very important. Users, last year, I mentioned we have 100 million users, or 100 million buyers on our commerce platform. In terms of engagement, transactions per user is a metric that we follow very closely. That's on the commerce side. On the Fintech side, obviously number of users, 61 million monthly active users last quarter. TPV for the acquiring business, then credit book, asset and the mansion that has been growing more than 100% year and years, is a metric that is very important to see engagement with our platform and then frequency of use.\nIn Fintech is very important to have principality. We're seeing people who have engaged with more than one product and how often they engage with different products. That's something that we pay a lot of attention. Then the credit business, obviously, the traditional metrics, MPLs, the spreads of our books, the different books, and so on the repayment of our credit card, for instance, which is a product that you need to invest to build a cohort, I would say those. Obviously, financial metrics at the end of the quarter, at the end of each month are very important to see top line growth, as well as profit margins are the two ones, the two metrics that tells us how we are doing in terms of growth feed rate profitability, as well as growth.\nAsit Sharma: Strategically, where you sit, where are you focusing the organization to create the most value when we look out over a very long time horizon? Is there a specific activity or investment that's going to create the greatest yield as we look beyond, say, the medium term that you like to talk about within the management team and encourage employees to think about?\nMartin de los Santos: Very important to have an owner's mentality team. We operate. We are fortunate to operate in a platform in a company. That has, as we like to say, has more doors to be open, that has to open them. We have opportunities everywhere we see. In commerce, we're just getting started. Penetration is very low. We continue to grow at a very rapid pace north of 30% year and year, twice the speed of the market, so we're continuing to gain market share. Even after 25 years, we're growing at start-up rates. On Fintech in Mexico, less than half the population have a bank account. Less than 15% have a credit card. The opportunity is immense as well to continue growing. Advertising, we mentioned it before, everywhere you look at mainly there are opportunities. We are fortunate to have a lot of resources to take on those opportunities. 18,000 developers, a very well, very strong balance sheet to invest.\nWe generate lots of cash, even though we are investing in our business as well. I think the big challenge is when you don't have a clear constraint is how to make sure that you are investing in the right things. That represents not only choosing what to invest, but also choosing what not to do, not to get and also to make sure that you are investing on things that really have a good payout, and they actually result in growth going forward. That's something that continuously my team and my colleagues at the sea level are continuously looking at, at the end of the day is maintaining this growth feed mentality that we have been operating. We want to make sure that we hit the growth targets. While, not shying away from investing, even if in the short term, we might put some pressure on margins. We don't mind. We don't run the business on a quarter by quarter basis. We run the business for the next 25 years.\nRon Gross: Coming up after the break, Emily Flippen and Matt Argersinger return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. Don't buy r sell stocks based solely on what you hear. All personal finance content follows Motley Fool editorial standards and are not approved by advertisers. The Motley Fool only picks products that it would personally recommend to friends like you. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money Ron Gross here with Emily Flippen and Matt Argersinger Fools, we've got time for two quick stories before we hit stocks on our radar. Let's start with the Walmart news on Wednesday, Walmart withdrew its earnings guidance, citing uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's newly imposed tariffs specifically on China. Emily, the health of Walmart can tell us a lot about the health of the consumer and, frankly, the economy as a whole. What did you take away from these actions by Walmart management?\nEmily Flippen: Unfortunately, my takeaway is that things will likely get worse before they get better. The silver lining to this is that Walmart did reaffirm its sales guidance. They actually are perceived to have a little bit more clarity into how consumers are behaving versus what their bottom line may look like, which is obviously heavily impacted by things like tariffs and any negotiations there. Not only does Walmart really act as that bellwether for how consumers are behaving, but it's also really easy to forget that Walmart's a little bit of a bellwether and a leader for other businesses that look to Walmart for guidance. So many companies are likely watching Walmart's decision here to pull back guidance on their bottom line, and they could potentially adopt a very similar wait-and-see approach here as it applies to their own guidance. And that can almost turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy of economic slowing and leading to a market sell-off all because of the cautiousness around things like earnings guidance. Now, I think that could be a dramatic interpretation, of course, and I'll just quickly mention that Walmart does have much more complex supply lines than a lot of other small businesses. Their certainty and clarity there could be more opaque than other companies. But the fact that they are a bellwether for both consumers, which we focus on, as well as other businesses is a bit of a red flag.\nRon Gross: The new Superman movie is scheduled to hit theaters this July. As listeners know, I am a Superman fanatic, really looking forward to it. Admittedly, the movies haven't always been so super, but there is a new sneak peek out there. I know you have both seen it, so I'm curious to ask. Do we have a hit on our hands or a dud? Did you have a favorite part of the sneak peek? I'll go to you first Matt.\nMatt Argersinger: Well, how can you not love Krypto coming in there, Krypto the super dog, coming in to rescue Superman from whatever ails him in that particular scene. But no, look, I think it looks awesome. I think Gunn did a fantastic job with the Guardians of Galaxy movies. I like that he's bringing a lot of interesting characters into the Superman movie, including looks like Hawk Man's in there. Looks like Guy Gardner, the Green Lantern characters in there. I'm excited. I'm going to go see it with my son, for sure. Emily, a hit or a dud?\nEmily Flippen: Well, let's put it this way. You're barking up the wrong tree, because I am not a superhero movie watcher. But I will say this. I watched the trailer at your bequest, and I didn't know the creepy CGI dog had a name. Nice to know.\nMatt Argersinger: You don't know Krypto? A creepy CGI dog.\nEmily Flippen: There's a lot of CGI in that trailer. CGI has come a long way. I don't know what I'm talking about, as it applies to CGI. I will say, it was obviously CGI, though. I do think it's a little bit of a red flag if you're having to bring in other superheroes to attract excitement. What does that say about Superman?\nRon Gross: Well, I am hopeful, and my favorite part is when the Fortress of solitude rises out of the snow as Superman gets closer, almost like it could sense where he was. I love that part. Very cool. Alright, Fools, a quick personal note before we hit stocks on our radar. This will be my last Motley Fool Money radio show. It has been the joy of my career to play a small part in the financial journey of as Chris Hill would say, our dozens of listeners. Thank you for letting me share my thoughts with you for 16 wonderful years. Thank you all very much. I really appreciate it.\nMatt Argersinger: Ron, can I just say?\nRon Gross: Yes, Matt.\nMatt Argersinger: Sixteen years, actually, 17 years with the Motley Fool. You've been a colleague, a mentor, a leader, most of all, a friend. I wish you the very best in retirement, and we will do our very best. It will be a lot harder now, but we will do our very best to keep this show firing on all cylinders.\nRon Gross: [laughs] I appreciate that. Thanks, Martin. Very nice. Fools, we have time for a couple of stocks on our radar, so let's close out the show that way, and I will bring in our man Dan Boyd, to ask a question and pick his favorite. Emily, you're up first. What have you got?\nEmily Flippen: I'm looking at Dexcom this week. It's nice to have a little bit of positive news in a world that is changing around us so rapidly. Some of the excitement here for Dexcom did get drowned out by tariff talk. But Dexcom did see a little bit of a revival this week because they did get FDA approval for their newest continuous glucose monitor that is a Dexcom G7. It could be worn for up to 15 days so that extending the life versus their previous model, it puts them in more direct competition with Abbott, who is one of their competitors, which also has the FreeStyle Libre, which can be worn up to 15 days. Ahead of Metronic. I definitely move in the right direction here for Dexcom. CGM penetration for diabetics worldwide is still so much lower than what it should be, considering the health benefits that it can bring. I will say, though, I always have in the back of my head, just the fear around a couple of things. One is weight loss drugs, leading to a decline in type 2 diabetes that could eat up some of the market here for Dexcom, as well as actually a potential cure for something like diabetes. That's further down the line, but a lot of research and time is being spent into it, considering it is such a deadly and expensive disease.\nRon Gross: Dan, you got a question or a comment?\nDan Boyd: Dexcom it's one of these companies that the name doesn't really match up with what they do. The name, to me, is, like, something out of Superman, very sinister. But what they do very good for society. I don't know what to do here, Emily.\nEmily Flippen: That's a good point. I will say Abbott sharing its name with Abbott Elementary. Sounds like the friendlier of the options, but I like Dexcom more, despite the name.\nRon Gross: Matt, you're up. What have you got?\nMatt Argersinger: Ron, I'm looking at RobinHood Markets. Ticker H-O-O-D. This is an unusual one for me. I just want to stress, this is a true radar stock, a company I'm just beginning to take a look at. But I heard a great interview with Robin Hood's chief brokerage officer last week. If you look at where young people, I'm talking mainly Emily's age, where they're going to open up brokerage accounts. It's not Fidelity. It's not Charles Schwab. It's certainly not Interactive Brokers where I tend to toil. It's Robin Hood. Nearly 26 million funded customers, many, I think most of which are in their 20s and 30s. When that large cohort of investors matures, starts opening retirement accounts, trust accounts, getting mortgages, doing more sophisticated trading. I think Robin Hood is really growing its offerings to like, a whole range of financial services. They also have the Robin Hood Gold membership, which is approaching three million accounts. It offers members higher levels of market data, greater margin access, could be dangerous, and then higher interest on cash and accounts. I have to say, I'm a shareholder in Schwab and I will probably be a shareholder in Schwab for a long time. But if I'm going to make a long term bet on a brokerage company, I might also want to have exposure to a brokerage company that has the most young people coming to it because it's likely to prosper right alongside that growth over time.\nRon Gross: Dan, got a question?\nDan Boyd: Yeah, when I hear Robin Hood, I associate it with meme stocks like GameStop and AMC and all that jazz. Is this a company that actually has legs, or is it just something that's going to be a flash in the pan?\nMatt Argersinger: Dan, I thought the same thing. It's the meme stock brokerage. But the fact that they have 26 million funded customers, and that has continued growing way past the GameStop and AMC stuff that we saw several years ago, that gives you confidence that has long term staying power.\nRon Gross: I, too, am a Charles Schwab shareholder, not a Robin Hood one, but I'll take a look. Could be interesting. Dan, you got a favorite fear watch list?\nDan Boyd: Well, it really seems like Dexcom is, like, the smart choice, but Robin Hood, I feel like is the more interesting choice. Can I do both on your last day, Ron?\nRon Gross: You can do whatever you want, Dan. Both it is.\nDan Boyd: That's awesome.\nRon Gross: Emily Flippen and Matt Argersinger, thanks for being here, my friends. That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money.

The carrier took the unusual step of issuing two profit forecasts, saying adjusted earnings will be $11.50 to $13.50 a share this year if the current environment remains stable, or as little as $7 a share if the US economy enters a recession.\n“That’s a pretty good downside,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson, who added that he’s never seen a company give a multi-scenario outlook before. “I expect airlines to bleed red in a recession.”\n“It is true that the environment has gotten a lot harder,” United Chief Executive Officer Scott Kirby said Wednesday on the company’s earnings call, adding that the carrier has a “real shot” to achieve its rosier outlook. “No matter what the economic environment is, we are going to bust our asses to get there.”\nWall Street applauded the two-pronged show of confidence, sending United’s shares up more than 5% during the call before the stock turned negative, in line with a broader market slump. American Airlines Group Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. report first-quarter earnings next week.\nUnited offered a counter to warnings from rival airlines that growth and profits are at risk due to Trump’s tariffs. Delta Air Lines Inc. last week withdrew its 2025 financial guidance due to global trade uncertainty and waning confidence among consumers and businesses that has “flat-lined” revenue growth. The parent of Frontier Airlines also withdrew its full-year profit outlook due to the murky economic environment.\n“We like United’s guidance approach given the fluidity of the macro backdrop,” Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Linenberg said in a report.\nTrump’s rapid trade policy shifts — slapping tariffs on countries and goods before granting relief soon after — have made it difficult for companies to forecast demand and earnings with any precision. United said the macroeconomic environment this year “is impossible to predict” with any confidence.\n“Time will tell how the backdrop plays out, but management has had a knack of pulling a rabbit out of the hat,” Melius Research analyst Conor Cunningham said in a note. “At the very least, there is now a downside scenario in which investors can attempt to get comfortable around.”\nUnited isn’t alone in seeing divergent outcomes. The Bank of Canada on Wednesday published two sets of forecasts, instead of its usual single projection. One outlines a temporary stall in Canadian economic activity, and the second sketches out an outright downturn that lasts a year. Separately, Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Monday laid out two scenarios for how Trump’s trade policy could affect the US economy, including one in which economic growth would slow “to a crawl” should steep US tariffs remain in place for some time.\nDeep government job cuts and changing border policies by the Trump administration have already cut into bookings for domestic trips. United said premium cabin sales over the last two weeks were up 17% while international grew 5% year over year. The carrier’s first-quarter adjusted profit of 91 cents a share topped Wall Street’s expectation for 74 cents.\nUnited said it will reduce that flying by four percentage points starting in the third quarter and will continue trimming some flying on low-demand days going into the fourth quarter. The airline said Wednesday it would move up the planned early retirement of 21 airplanes.\nThe carrier expects an adjusted profit in the current quarter will be $3.25 to $4.25 a share, compared with the $3.97 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Delta has also said it expects to post a second-quarter profit.\n--With assistance from Christopher Condon.\n(Retops with executive commentary, analyst reaction from the first paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nWith President Donald Trump announcing a wide set of tariffs, there could be increased costs for a range of companies.

They analyzed deepfake ad scams involving public figure impersonations and developed countermeasures. \nThe company introduced technical countermeasures and over 30 ads and publisher policy updates last year. These moves helped suspend over 700,000 offending advertising accounts, leading to a 90% drop in reports of deepfake ads, the company claims.\nIn the U.S. alone, Google said it suspended 39.2 million advertiser accounts and took down 1.8 billion ads last year, with key violations tied to ad network abuse, trademark misuse, healthcare claims, personalized ads, and misrepresentation.\nIndia, the world’s most populous country and the second biggest internet market after China in terms of users, saw 2.9 million account suspensions last year, Google said, making it the second-highest after the U.S. The company also removed 247.4 million ads in India, with the top five policy violations related to financial services, trademark misuse, ad network abuse, personalized ads, and gambling and games.\nOf all the advertiser account suspensions, Google said it suspended 5 million accounts for scam-related violations.\nOverall, the company removed almost half a billion ads related to scams.\nGoogle also verified more than 8,900 new election advertisers in 2024, which saw half of the world’s population go to the polls, and removed 10.7 million election ads. However, Rodriguez noted that the volume of election ads compared to Google’s overall ad numbers was relatively small and would not significantly impact its safety metrics this year.\nIn total, Google said it blocked 5.1 billion ads last year and removed 1.3 billion pages. In comparison, it blocked over 5.5 billion ads and took action against 2.1 billion publisher pages in 2023.\nGoogle told TechCrunch that the decreasing numbers indicated improvements in its prevention efforts. By improving early detection and suspension of malicious accounts, fewer harmful ads are produced or reach the platform, the company said.\nThe company also restricted 9.1 billion ads last year, it said. \nImportantly, large-scale suspensions sometimes spark concerns over how fairly a company applies its rules. Google said it offers an appeal process that includes human reviews to ensure it took “appropriate action.”\n“Oftentimes, some of our message wasn’t as clear and transparent about specifics, about what the rationale was, or reasoning, and sometimes that left the advertiser a little more confused. We ended up updating a bunch of our policies as it related to that, a bunch of our transparency capabilities in terms of the messaging around what and why to help the advertiser … It’s been a big focus for the team as part of 2024 and into 2025,” Rodriguez said.\nTopics\n\nReporter\n\n Microsoft researchers say they’ve developed a hyper-efficient AI model that can run on CPUs\n\n\n\n Figma ignores the fear, files paperwork for an IPO\n\n\n\n For security, Android phones will now auto-reboot after three days\n\n\n\n Figma sent a cease-and-desist letter to Lovable over the term ‘Dev Mode’\n\n\n\n Notorious image board 4chan hacked and internal data leaked\n\n\n\n Notion releases an AI-powered email client for Gmail\n\n\n\n Hertz says customers’ personal data and driver’s licenses stolen in data breach\n\n\n\n© 2025 Yahoo.\n1,200+ founders & VCs.

(GOOG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned -2.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has lost 5.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.06 per share, indicating a change of +9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.6% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.87 points to a change of +10.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.17 indicates a change of +14.6% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $75.53 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $331.22 billion and $368.31 billion estimates indicate +12.2% and +11.2% changes, respectively.\nAlphabet reported revenues of $81.62 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.9%. EPS of $2.15 for the same period compares with $1.64 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81.38 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.3%. The EPS surprise was +1.42%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025.\nOn April 4, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives appeared on CNBC to discuss the potential impact of current tariffs and compared the situation to an economic armageddon. If the current tariffs remain in place, Ives thinks it would lead to a 15% to 20% demand reduction across the board. He thinks that investor anxiety is much higher considering how things were in the March 2020 COVID-19 crash earlier. The analyst thinks that investors should now focus on the likelihood of tariff adjustments from comments about negotiations, the impact on consumer-focused companies, and the potential for demand destruction. He even thinks that companies may refuse to provide guidance in the first-quarter earnings calls due to the persistent tariff uncertainty.\nIves thinks that a lot of tech companies will not be able to absorb high tariff increases and rather this cost will be passed on to the consumers which will lead to significant margin erosion and even potential sales declines. He indicated that tech stocks are currently pricing in a 10% to 15% cut to numbers. He suggests that investors should now look at companies with strong long-term potential as he believes earnings may normalize in 2025 and 2026. The analyst also addressed the defensive performance of defense contractors. While acknowledging the relative stability here, Ives cautioned that even these even such sectors are not immune to tariffs. He noted the significant foreign component, specifically 40% to 50% in some instances, in hardware and other sectors.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through the financial media reports to compile a list of the top NASDAQ stocks to buy for 2025. We then selected the 13 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 234\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a tech company that operates through three segments. The Google Services segment provides products and services like ads, Chrome, Gmail, and YouTube. The Google Cloud segment offers AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, cybersecurity, and data & analytics, among others. The Other Bets segment sells healthcare-related and internet services.\nOn March 31, Ken Gawrelski, an analyst at Wells Fargo, reaffirmed an Equal Weight rating on the company while lowering the price target to $167 from $184. This cautious sentiment is a result of the company’s current trough multiples and bearish investor sentiment. This is because they believe that Google’s search business is put at risk by new AI-related technologies.\nHowever, the increasing demand for AI infrastructure and GenAI solutions has improved the adoption of GCP (Google Cloud Platform). GCP recently outpaced the entire cloud market. The company’s overall Cloud segment rose by 30$ year-over-year in Q4 2024. Notably, the company’s 6th-gen TPU called Trillium enhances AI workload significantly. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) AI-developed platform called Vertex AI increased its customers by fivefold in Q4.\nOakmark Equity and Income Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was the top contributor during the quarter. Despite ongoing litigation with the Department of Justice in its antitrust case, the U.S.-headquartered interactive media and services company’s stock price rose after posting solid third-quarter earnings. In the Search division, the company generated low-teens year-over-year revenue growth and management highlighted that they’re seeing strong user engagement with their new AI Overviews feature. The biggest upside surprise came from the Cloud division, where revenue growth accelerated to 35% and margins reached a record of 17%. This performance was driven by client demand for AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions as well as core Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products. We continue to believe Alphabet is a collection of great businesses that can unlock further value over the long term through its world-class AI capabilities.”\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy so far in 2025. While we acknowledge the growth potential of GOOGL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The fund’s investor class returned 1.14% in the first quarter, compared to a -4.27% return for the S&P 500 Index. The fund has returned 12.76% since its inception compared to the index return of 10.44% over the same period. The largest contributors to the fund for the quarter were financials and consumer staples while consumer discretionary and communication services detracted. In addition, you can check the fund’s top 5 holdings to determine its best picks for 2025.\nIn its first quarter 2025 investor letter, Oakmark Fund emphasized stocks such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, offers various platforms and services operating through Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments. The one-month return of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was -4.57%, and its shares lost 0.85% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On April 15, 2025, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock closed at $158.68 per share with a market capitalization of $1.918 trillion.\nOakmark Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q1 2025 investor letter:\n\"Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was the top detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered company’s stock price declined despite having posted fourth-quarter 2024 earnings that were in line with consensus expectations. Search revenue growth remained strong, and management reiterated that the new “AI Overviews” feature is driving higher engagement with comparable monetization. The one miss during the quarter was in the Cloud segment, where revenue grew 30% year-over-year but fell slightly short of consensus expectations. We believe the shortfall was largely due to short-term capacity constraints and that the long-term growth outlook for Google Cloud remains robust. We continue to see Alphabet as a collection of great businesses that can further benefit from the company’s world class AI capabilities. With shares trading at just 15x our estimate of next year’s earnings per share, we believe the stock is meaningfully undervalued.\"\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nAlphabet Inc.

A massive UK class action claims Google weaponized its default search engine status to freeze out competitors and force British businesses to overpay for digital ads. Filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal, the lawsuit says Google struck deals with Android phone makers and paid Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to make its search engine the default across devices, locking in market control and pushing ad prices higher than they should've been.\nLeading the charge is competition law expert Or Brook, who argues UK businesses had no real choice: if you wanted visibility online, you had to play by Google's rulesand pay up. The claim alleges that Google built a walled garden around search ads, where it not only dominated volume (over 90% of UK searches) but also offered enhanced functionality only through its own channels. Over 200,000 businesses are said to have been impacted. Brook didn't hold back: Google has been leveraging its dominance in the general search and search advertising market to overcharge advertisers.\nGoogle's response? Predictable. The company called the lawsuit speculative and opportunistic, and insists people use Google because it's helpfulnot because they're forced to. But the timing couldn't be worse. Britain's Competition and Markets Authority is already investigating Google's grip on digital ads, and the global antitrust spotlight on Big Tech is only getting brighter.

US stocks opening in the red this morning with tech leading the losses here. Options data showing investors are positioning for further losses in mega cap tech and semis ahead of earnings. That's according to data from Bloomberg. Joining us now with more, David Harden, Summit Global Investments CIO. David, great to speak with you this morning. Certainly a lot of pain for the big tech names this morning.\nThank you.\nAre you buying big tech at these levels?\nWell, I think there's some definitely buying opportunities that are coming available. For example, one of the things that I like is Google. Google has $25 billion in free cash flows last quarter. It's it's it's growing at double digits year-over-year. Its profit margins are great. Its return on equity is around 30%. And the PE is now finally getting down into those reasonable levels you can consider 16, 17, 15. So I think I think these are buying opportunities to start accumulating more positions in something like a Google.\nI think what you're highlighting is the, you know, this one thing is not like the other in the tech trade even as you're looking at what is more of a platform play where there's perhaps more of a reason to believe that the consumers would flow into free products that a Google might offer online versus what we're seeing in some of the products and propensity to spend in some of the other tech plays where there might be a consumer pullback in those discretionary dollars. How do you continue to look across these companies once we get into earnings and see how they're forecasting and guiding for the rest of the year on that?\nYeah, I think that's really important because where did their earnings come from, right? And and how are they tied to tariffs? That's really important. And how does those tariffs impact like advertising for Google. So you want to look kind of through those earnings into the consumer and and see what that consumer's doing and how that consumer's acting. And I think that's another play in tech. There is a separation. What? Are they hardware? Like Apple's had to navigate a lot more tariff news than Google's had to navigate, even though they're both navigating it.\nAnd we're starting to see individual companies being used as tools in this trade war. Obviously with Nvidia's specific chips being impacted by export controls, to what extent does that change any fundamental view you have on these stocks or should investors look past any of that daily headline news on tariffs?\nI I I think absolutely, you have to consider that and you have to manage your your risk here. Risk is really, really important in these markets and managing that is essential. So where you have the H20 chip, for example, invidia, they have clearly shown last night on their earnings that they have a difficult time more difficult time than some of these other tech names. So look for tech names that are more US based. Look for tech names that have more um say high-quality earnings. Even though somebody could question Google's high quality earnings, their earnings scores are not very good, but it is more US based. It is more consumer based in the US. And so that's very, very important in tech.\nIt seems like we've all been asking the question of what's the next big catalyst to drive conviction within the markets. Does that mean the AI trade or the fast-paced growth cycle for the AI trade is dead?\nNo, I don't think so because let's face it. Probably 10 minutes ago you were looking at AI, or I was looking at AI, or somebody was looking at some agent and the and the new things that are coming out with AI agents and things of this nature are absolutely impactful. The power of AI is growing. It's not shrinking. We're using it more. And it will continue to spread. So I think that trade's not done. I think there'll continue to be infrastructure build outs and AI things, but it has to go past just the technology. You have to look into the in industrial side of tech and where are they putting and building these centers at.\nI want to get to one of your cells, but first really quickly, would you buy Nvidia at these levels?\nUh probably not right now. No. I would be if you're if you're in it, it's time to hold and be patient. But if you're looking to buy, I think there's better opportunities to buy.\nAnd I know one of them is Microsoft, correct?\nI if you're looking at the two comparison, yes, Microsoft today, Nvidia's down more 6-7%, Microsoft's down in one, one and a half right now. I I think that's a safer play. It's a little bit more if if you will ingrained in our society. The revenues are are more um consistent. And so that's something that I would look at is more something like a Google or Microsoft. Both of those I would consider buying opportunities, especially at these levels.\nAnd I know a sell for you is one member of the mag 7. Talk to us about Tesla.\nWell, I think Tesla's had some negative earnings. We know that and um it's under pressure. I think every Tesla's uh I I saw a sticker on the back of a Tesla the other day that said something like, I bought this post crazy. So this is this is very, very important right now in our society. But having said that, I think Elon Musk is going to tell you when it's the right time to buy Tesla. And he hasn't done that yet. So he he's outspoken. We know what he's capable of. And until he's ready to let us know it's the right time to buy, I think it's you avoid that stock right now.\nOutside of tech, where's your favorite trade, your top idea right now?\nAnd I think I think outside of tech, you're going to have to look at some of the healthcare companies that have really been hurt with the Pharmatech news and other things.\nIt seems like they're next though in the docket for what potential tariffs may look like.\nOh, absolutely. So look for those healthcare companies that are not necessarily tied to pharma and they get their revenue, surgical centers and other places that are hospital-based, that are US-based, that we are going to use on a daily basis, but really are not tied to that. Those are the ones that have been kind of the baby been thrown out with the bath water. Their their valuations are very good right now.\nAbsolutely. David, great to see you here in studio.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other machine-learning stocks.\nGrand View Research reported that the global machine-learning market was valued at $36.73 billion in 2022. It’s now expected to grow at a 34.8% CAGR from 2023 to 2030. Machine learning helps machines and systems learn from experience instead of through explicit programming. It uses algorithms to improve and analyze vast amounts of complex data to make informed decisions. Machine learning is quickly progressing as AI is rapidly expanding and transforming how businesses and individuals operate. These technological advancements are revolutionizing consumer experiences, and enabling convenient creation of digital services, products, and optimized supply chains. With this, startups can focus on specific solutions while larger companies can deliver comprehensive AI platforms.\nOn April 10, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the cost of AI and what has to happen to bring it down. Jassy emphasized that the growth in data center demand is now so significant that there is no foreseen attenuation here, even with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties under tariffs. While there’s a general belief that the emergence of DeepSeek could now reduce the need for extensive data centers, processing power, and energy consumption previously forecasted at different tech companies, Jassy thinks that DeepSeek’s introduction did not disrupt any of this. Despite cost reductions that occurred have already over time, AI deployment still requires significant investment. He thinks that the current AI operations are expensive due to chip costs and other factors, but big techs, including his own company, would welcome any reductions in AI costs for customers moving forward.\nJassy underscored the demand for data centers despite tariff impacts and reflected optimism regarding lowering costs, which would potentially drive innovation and expanded use of AI across industries. AI is still limited and requires substantial human oversight as of now but it has massive potential across various sectors.\nWe sifted through ETFs and financial media reports to compile a list of the top ML stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 234\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a tech company that is currently leading in AI research and uses machine learning across its search engine, cloud services, and other offerings. It operates through three segments under the name of Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments. The Google Cloud segment offers AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, cybersecurity, data and analytics, and other related services.\nRoth MKM recently reiterated a Buy rating on the company with a $220 price target on March 19. This sentiment was fueled by the company’s $32 billion Wiz acquisition. This is the largest acquisition in the company’s history. With this, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) can offer improved cloud security and threat detection data across cloud environments. The company is also positioned for long-term AI growth due to its significant infrastructure. This includes data centers, GPUs, and TPUs.\nThe company’s advanced AI-powered features like AI Overviews in Search are monetized at the same rate as traditional search. For AI and cloud growth, the company is planning a $75 billion CapEx investment in 2025. This will particularly be focused on data centers and servers. Notably, the company’s Cloud business alone grew by 30% year-over-year in Q4 2024. The combined annual revenue from Cloud and Youtube exceeded $110 billion.\nOakmark Equity and Income Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was the top contributor during the quarter. Despite ongoing litigation with the Department of Justice in its antitrust case, the U.S.-headquartered interactive media and services company’s stock price rose after posting solid third-quarter earnings. In the Search division, the company generated low-teens year-over-year revenue growth and management highlighted that they’re seeing strong user engagement with their new AI Overviews feature. The biggest upside surprise came from the Cloud division, where revenue growth accelerated to 35% and margins reached a record of 17%. This performance was driven by client demand for AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions as well as core Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products. We continue to believe Alphabet is a collection of great businesses that can unlock further value over the long term through its world-class AI capabilities.”\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the best machine learning stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of GOOGL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

So after the chip maker disclosed that it would take a $5.5 billion dollar hit from the US government's surprise new controls on its semiconductor exports to China. For more on the latest, let's welcome now Daniel Newman, Futurum CEO. Daniel, it is great to see you here on set. Appreciate it from Texas. Um, you know, before J. Powell, frankly, this was the story of the day. It was chips, it was Nvidia. Nvidia is down here, Dan. It's not about 10%. It's getting clobbered in today's trade. I guess two, two questions to start. One, Dan, were you surprised by that news when you saw those headlines? And two, do you think down 10%, is that move justified in your opinion?\nYeah, first of all, nobody should have been surprised by this move. Really the administration's been giving the signal that it was going to clamp down. Now, what was interesting is this week, there was a bit of gyration because they cut this deal, they announced 500 billion dollars of AI supercomputers being built here in the United States. And then a day later, he pulls back on this new export licensing requirement.\nThat that, you bring that, Dan. That is an interesting point because there were some folks who thought Jensen Wong was going to be kind of shielded from this. Right?\nThey made a deal. I had a few reporters actually hit me up, do you think there was some tip for tat going on. And first of all, I think Trump needs to show, President Trump needs to show that there is no tip for tat. So whether it's, you know, Tim Cook bringing more manufacturing here, whether it's TSMC coming here. But I actually think on the other side of this, and maybe we come back to this, is that I actually think creating some certainty with the, with the community, the business community, about what type of benefit they can expect by onshoring and bringing manufacturing back here. I think that would be a great start. Having said that, national security, economic security, and AI are tightly correlated. Us giving the chips to China, whether it's the tuned down chips or the best chips coming through intermediaries, which they shouldn't be getting. This is something that's giving an advantaging China. There's a lot of people out there that are like, oh, well, this is going to only push their resolve. Do you think China is waiting because we're sending Nvidia chips, they're not investing in Huawei and building their own chips? You can be absolutely certain that they are. This war, this trade war, is largely being fought on the grounds of long-term economic domination. Long-term economic domination will only be had if we control the technology trade. Nvidia is at the forefront of that trade.\nAnd what do you think of from an investor standpoint? Here you have Nvidia falling yet again, 8 to 10%. You know, look what happened over the last couple days. It had recovered from its lows, right? And a lot of investors who got in short term experienced that bounce. Where, where do you think that looks like this week?\nYeah. I, I look at that line of people around the corner at $150 that just couldn't wait to buy. And you go, what is really changed? Well, first of all, you've got GPUs melting over at, at X and at OpenAI. There's so much demand there. Could Nvidia pivot some of its capacity, not focus so much on building specialized products for China, and make sure we meet all the capacity and demand that's out there for companies that are in the US that are trying to build? You've got $325 billion of CAPEX. And it's been reiterated. So whether it's been Sunder Pichai, whether it's been Satya Nadella, they're all planning to spend. And I genuinely believe, Sylvia, that the companies with, you know, the big operating leverage are going to look at this pullback as the moment to build AI infrastructure out. Because when we come out of this, and we will come out of this, there will be deals made. Calling that on the record right now. It may be a tough couple of months. When deals are made, we will see the economy accelerate. And those companies want to build the future and have that AI infrastructure in place. So the Googles and the Microsofts and the Amazons, they're going to buy Nvidia. Um, and one other thing, if I, if I may, I find it very interesting that everybody thinks that China and their push to build Huawei is going to be so successful. When AMD came out with a competitive product, no one believed they could build the software. Broadcom's making chips for the hyperscalers and everyone said, well, that's great, but they don't have CUDA. So it's not going to work as well. But suddenly, everybody believes that China and Huawei is going to build the CUDA competitive product that's going to undo Nvidia? I believe in China, I believe in their resolve. I don't believe that they have as much competition or much competitive capability today as people are suggesting.\nUNI Europa argues that American digital giants like Amazon benefit from unfair economic advantages in the world’s largest single market and should be dealt with accordingly.\nSNOW and MDB are well-known players in the database management system space. Which one is a better investment option?\nNvidia discloses that sales of its H20 chips to China would require a license ‘for the indefinite future’ from the U.S. Department of Commerce, AMD says a license requirement for chip exports will result in charges of up to $800 million, and ASML issues disappointing sales guidance.\nU.S. markets fell sharply Wednesday, with chip stocks leading the retreat as U.S.-China trade tensions spooked investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 3.1%, the S&P 500 lost 2.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 700 points, or 1.7%. Losses rippled across sectors, dragging the Russell 2000 down 1.4%.\nDavid Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, discusses expectations for US economic growth, the lack of liquidity in markets, and the outlook for earnings growth. He speaks on \"Bloomberg Open Interest.\"\nWorld stocks fell into a downward spiral on Wednesday led by tech losses after Washington said it is putting new curbs on AI chip exports to China, marking an escalation in the global trade war.  The Trump administration's latest broadside sparked huge demand for safe-haven assets like gold, the Swiss franc and U.S. Treasuries, even though Fed Chair Jerome Powell signalled he is in no rush to cut interest rates.  If U.S. Big Tech had acquired a safe-haven status in the eyes of some investors in recent years, it is disappearing fast.\nThe March retail sales report comes as investors are closely watching for any signs of slowing in US economic growth before the implementation of President Trump's tariffs.\nNextEra (NEE) has an impressive earnings surprise history and currently possesses the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely beat in its next quarterly report.\nTrump wants to bring tech manufacturing to the US.

The messages, often between Zuckerberg and other top Meta executives, painted a picture of an executive who was paranoid about his rivals and willing to buy competitors whenever possible.\nThe FTC is seeking to force Meta to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that the two acquisitions have given Meta an illegal monopoly over parts of the social networking industry. Emails and documents presented at trial show that Meta, then called Facebook Inc., struggled to compete in the mobile app boom in the early 2010s, buying up successful competitors. The FTC said Meta bought the companies to eliminate direct competitive threats.\nMultiple Competitors\nZuckerberg and Meta’s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Meta faces a wide array of competitors that fight for user attention, including ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, Google’s YouTube, Apple Inc.’s iMessage and Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that TikTok, in particular, posed a “highly urgent” competitive threat when it sprang up in 2018.\n“We observed that our growth slowed down dramatically,” as TikTok gained popularity, Zuckerberg said Wednesday. “It was highly urgent, this has been a top priority for the company for several years.” Meta eventually rolled out a direct competitor, called Reels, that now drives a significant amount of video traffic for the company.\nZuckerberg was at times vague over his three days in court, and regularly disputed the FTC’s interpretations of his prior emails. As a leader, the way he communicated with staff was often blunt or harsh, and he spent time on the stand trying to add more nuance to what was written by his younger self. He occasionally clashed with the FTC’s lead lawyer, Daniel Matheson, who objected at one point that Zuckerberg wasn’t answering his questions.\nWhat’s unclear is how much weight those emails will ultimately have as US District Judge James Boasberg, who is presiding over the case, makes his decision. Meta has argued that the intent behind the purchases doesn’t matter, only whether those deals lead to consumer harm, which it disputes.\nBoasberg previously said the FTC will have a difficult time. Despite allowing the bulk of the case to proceed last November, Boasberg struck a skeptical tone about the FTC’s chances at trial. “Prevailing here, however, does not obscure the fact that the Commission faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial,” the judge said. “Indeed, its positions at times strain this country’s creaking antitrust precedents to their limits.”\nBoasberg also said in a ruling shortly before the trial that the FTC must prove Meta is harming competition in the present day.\nSheryl Sandberg, the company’s former chief operating officer, followed Zuckerberg on the witness stand, facing sharp questioning from FTC lawyer Susan Musser.\nIf the FTC prevails, a spinoff of Instagram and WhatsApp would undo years of integration between the apps, disrupt two of the most popular digital consumer products in the world and potentially erase hundreds of billions of dollars in Meta’s market value. It would also raise serious questions about how the government evaluates and approves deals because the government allowed the transactions to go through at the time.\n‘Network Effects’\nPart of the FTC’s case involves the technical concept of “network effects,” meaning that the more users a company like Meta has, the more likely they are to retain a dominant position, because people are unlikely to switch to a service used by few people.\nBoasberg has remained largely silent during the questioning, but interjected during Zuckerberg’s testimony Wednesday to ask if network effects still really matter.\n“How much does it matter if your friends are on a particular platform if you can send content out of that platform? Why does it matter if your friends are there?” the judge said.\nZuckerberg said it doesn’t. “These apps now serve primarily as discovery engines,” he said. “People can take that content to messaging engines.”\nBigger Company\nUnder questioning by Meta lawyer, Mark Hansen, Zuckerberg refuted the FTC’s argument that Meta bought Instagram to bury a competitor. Instagram would not likely have been able to grow to the extent it has had it remained independent, he said. “Instagram has been built out into a much more vibrant service” as a result of the deal, Zuckerberg said.\nTaking a small online platform to a billion users and beyond is unlikely to happen without the backing of a larger company, he said. “Every company that has this level of scale is owned by a bigger company,” he said, citing TikTok and YouTube as examples.\nEarlier in the trial, it was revealed that Snap Inc.’s Evan Spiegel turned down a $6 billion acquisition offer from Facebook in 2013 for its Snapchat app. Zuckerberg said that the app would have grown more rapidly had it joined his company.\nZuckerberg sought to walk back some statements that he made in previous internal communications. He acknowledged that he sent a 2013 email saying that Facebook blocked advertising for messaging apps WeChat, Kakao and Line, in which he wrote the apps were “trying to build social networks to replace us.” On the stand this week, however, he said “it’s hard for me to characterize what their intent was.”\nMatheson also sought to show that Meta was aware of its antitrust risk years ago, including a possible breakup.\nHe displayed an email from 2018 in which Zuckerberg suggested that Meta should consider spinning off Instagram into a standalone company. “As calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway,” he wrote.\nAt one point, Zuckerberg was asked by Hansen to describe how he was evaluating the competitive threat posed by Instagram and others at the time of the deals.

Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, which is now based in Singapore, said in separate but nearly identical notices that their operating expenses have gone up “due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs.”  Both companies said they would be making “price adjustments” starting April 25, although neither provided details about the size of the increases.\nTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results\nSign in to access your portfolio\n\n\n\nTry again."

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates in a worst-case scenario, the hit this year from reduced travel and boycotts could total 0.3% of gross domestic product, which would amount to almost $90 billion.\nForeign tourism has been a tailwind for the US in recent years as the cessation of pandemic-era restrictions sparked a resurgence of international travel. But many potential visitors are now rethinking their vacation plans amid increased hostility at the border, rising geopolitical frictions and global economic uncertainty.\nOne of them is Curtis Allen, a Canadian videographer who canceled an upcoming US vacation after President Donald Trump imposed punitive tariffs on his home country and suggested it should become the 51st US state. Allen and his partner have been on multiple camping trips to Oregon over the years, but this year, they will be traveling around British Columbia instead.\n“We’re not just staying home,” said Allen, 34. “We’re going to go spend the same money somewhere else.”\nAllen’s hesitance doesn’t stop there. He canceled his Netflix subscription and is actively avoiding American imports at the grocery store.\n“Now it takes us double the time, because we’re looking at where the products came from,” he said.\nInternational travelers spent a record $254 billion in the US last year, according to ITA figures. Coming into 2025, the outlook was positive: The ITA projected in early March that the US would welcome 77 million visitors this year, just shy of the 2019 record, before pushing to a new high in 2026.\nBut those estimates came out just before stories of harsh detentions at US airports, ensnaring travelers from countries like France and Germany, started making headlines. Major public institutions in Canada, including a pension management firm and a leading hospital, are now advising staff against traveling to the US.\nAlmost $20 billion in retail spending from international tourists in the US may be at risk, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis.\nEarly signs of a sharp pullback are already showing up. Airfares, hotel rates and car rental costs fell in March, according to a monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics report on consumer prices published April 10. Economists at Goldman Sachs and HSBC Holdings Plc said lower demand, including from foreign travelers, probably played a role.\nOmair Sharif, president of Inflation Insights, noted the decline in hotel rates was driven by an almost 11% drop in the Northeast in particular, possibly a result of fewer Canadians traveling there.\n“Given what we know about how much Canadian travel has fallen off, that’s potentially a bit worrying for that region,” Sharif said.\nThe timing is “very interesting” for Rainbow Air Helicopter Tours in Niagara Falls — which just invested $25 million in a new building, an enhanced fleet and a virtual reality attraction ahead of the busy summer season — said Patrick Keyes, the firm’s sales and marketing manager. “We are waiting to see the fallout,” he said.\nCanadian flight reservations to the US are down 70% through September versus the same period last year, according to a report by OAG Aviation Worldwide. Meanwhile US summer bookings are also down 25% among European tourists at Accor SA hotels — which Chief Executive Officer Sébastien Bazin said could be attributed to border detentions creating a “bad buzz” and diverting tourists to other destinations.\n“US tariff announcements and a more aggressive stance toward historical allies have hurt global opinions about the US,” Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Megan Peters said in a March 31 report.\n“This headwind provides another reason — in addition to the more direct negative impacts of tariffs and drag on exports from foreign retaliation that are already built into our US GDP forecast — why US GDP growth will likely underperform consensus expectations in 2025,” they said.\nDespite the worsening outlook, Oregon’s tourism commission — known as Travel Oregon — is continuing efforts to attract foreign visitors, said CEO Todd Davidson. His team just came back from a trip to pitch the state at an adventure tourism conference in Vancouver, and in the coming weeks they will be hosting sales and marketing partners from places like the UK, India and Brazil.\nAt the same time, they’re also contemplating whether the commission will need to shift its strategy more toward domestic visitors as the situation unfolds.\n“Oregon is not and will not take its eye off those international markets,” Davidson said. “We will be here when our international visitors feel that they are ready to return.”\n(Updates to add Canada executives advising against US travel in ninth paragraph.)\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nRisks are mounting but, overall, the economy is still in a good place, according to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.\nCEOs have warned on the economy because of Trump administration tariff policies. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has a message for them all.\nLast week's rally in the broader stock market indexes sprung the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) back upward after a more than 20% that technically put it into a bear market.  Income investors looking at the current landscape may be wondering if now is the best time to buy dividend stocks given the wild swings to the upside and the downside.

Recent tensions between the U.S. and China may have injected some volatility, yet the company's robust earnings and share repurchase likely supported its impressive performance.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\nOn Friday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer outlined what investors should focus on in the week, especially pointing to earnings reports from major banks.\n“Rumor, innuendo, intrigue these are the stuff of great novels, of fabulous miniseries, riveting plays, and now they’re the stuff of the stock market.”\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks and 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently.\nHe noted the chaotic nature of the current environment and remarked that “this tape has it all,” and emphasized how unpredictable developments from the White House have added to the turbulence. Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes.\n“Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,” he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, “Except this isn’t an eight-part blockbuster, it’s our money.” Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday’s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic.\nCramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a “liberation day bottom,” a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, “Not sure, I’m just not sure.” He added:\n“Have you ever noticed the weekends don’t provide relaxation anymore because the president’s got advisors? He’s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He’s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime…. Monday’s trading, well, let’s just say that it looks like that it’s earning season so it’s gonna be even harder than usual.”\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NYSE:GS) was mentioned during the episode, and here’s what he had to say:\n“Alright, well, let’s start with Goldman Sachs, right? That’s what it’s, it’s the first bank stock. It’s the first stock that reports this week and I’ve gotta tell you, usually doesn’t report on Mondays. It’s interesting. JPMorgan stole the show today with a monster good quarter. Wells Fargo was too run of the mill. That one hurt me for my Charitable Trust. I don’t know… Morgan Stanley, better. Goldman’s by far the most controversial. Why? Because as an investment bank, its business can be pretty episodic.\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is a financial firm known for investment banking. It also provides wealth management services and other financial solutions.\nOverall, GS ranks 1st on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in.\nAs we recently discussed in another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’s Berkshire picks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.\nOverall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio. So, let’s take a look at the top Goldman Sachs value stocks.\nEngineers using the latest Cisco TelePresence technology to collaborate with colleagues around the world.\nTo compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Cisco’s board also approved a $15 billion boost to its share repurchase program, bringing the total available for buybacks to around $17 billion.\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 84 hedge funds were long Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), up from 60 funds in the prior quarter.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in.\nAs we recently discussed in another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’s Berkshire picks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.\nOverall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio. So, let’s take a look at the top Goldman Sachs value stocks.\nA team of data experts gathered around a computer monitor analyzing customer data.\nTo compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nGoldman Sachs' Q4 2024 Stake Value: $2,305,571,920\nP/E Ratio as of April 11: 23.20\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 79\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is a global professional services company based in Dublin, Ireland.

At the end of the December quarter, Goldman Sachs held 5.71 million shares of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) valued at $2.30 billion, making it one of the top Goldman Sachs value stocks to consider.\nOn March 25, BMO Capital Markets reiterated a Market Perform rating on Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) with a $355 price target. Analyst Keith Bachman believes ACN’s current outlook is solid, but he does not expect any big jumps in the stock for now.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) announced new bookings of $20.9 billion, with revenue of $16.7 billion, up 5% in US dollars and 8.5% in local currency. The company’s free cash flow came in at $2.68 billion.

David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management was a significant position holder in the company, with 2.49 million shares worth nearly $876 million.\nOverall, ACN ranks 7th among the Goldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks. While we acknowledge the potential of value stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Both production and consumption indicated unexpected momentum in March, before massive US levies on Chinese goods kicked in this month.\nThe rosy picture will give little comfort to policymakers as economic activities are expected to deteriorate starting from April. Cargo data last week already showed a slowdown in the volume of goods processed by Chinese ports, foreshadowing a decline in commerce as global companies pause orders and reduce output.\nThe improvement is “all in the past now,” said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale SA. “Stimulus delivery is still pretty urgent. Things can deteriorate fairly quickly with some high-frequency data showing tariff impact on US-bound shipments.”\nIn a sign that tariff fears prevailed, Chinese stocks in Hong Kong extended their losses to as much as 3.3%. The yuan was steady at 7.3297 in the offshore market, while the 10-year government bond yield fell 2 basis points to 1.63%.\nThe data released by the National Bureau of Statistics suggests the economy was supported in part by front-loaded shipments before tariffs jumped to prohibitive levels this month.\nWithout more stimulus, China could struggle to meet its official growth target of around 5% this year. Exports are expected to contract after contributing to a third of growth in 2024, while business and consumer sentiment will likely suffer a blow from the trade war.\nEconomists at international banks including UBS Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. and Societe Generale have lowered their forecasts for China’s 2025 growth in recent weeks to around 4% or lower. Australia & New Zealand Banking Group announced a similar downgrade following the data release.\nThe Chinese economy’s performance this year will largely depend on how much stimulus Beijing rolls out and how quickly it deploys support measures. A key factor will be the sustainability of the recovery in consumer demand, which has been buoyed by subsidies for buying cars, appliances and smartphones.\nSome economists expect the People’s Bank of China to cut interest rates or the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve as soon as this month, while others predicted several trillions of yuan in additional fiscal borrowing and spending to fill the gap left by declined exports.\nThe government could also provide targeted help to exporters by expediting tax rebate payouts or offering them cheaper loans, according to Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc.\nA meeting by the Communist Party’s decision-making Politburo at the end of April will likely provide further clues to policymakers’ thinking when it comes to the timing and size of stimulus. With the positive data, the risk is that officials could decide to act only when growth hits a wall.\n“The government may wait to observe the magnitude of the slowdown in exports and react accordingly,” Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.\nOff to a Good Start\nData released Wednesday showed industrial output expanding 7.7% in March from a year ago, the fastest growth since June 2021. Retail sales increased 5.9%, the best pace since December 2023 and much stronger than the 4.3% gain expected by economists.\nThe NBS struck a note of caution even as it released the positive indicators, emphasizing the need for greater support for the economy.\n“The external environment is becoming more complex and severe, and the drive for growth of effective domestic demand is insufficient,” the bureau said in a statement. “We must implement more proactive and effective macro policies.”\nHighlights of other key economic indicators:\nFixed-asset investment rose 4.2% in the first three months of 2025, and property investment contracted 9.9%. Both are largely in line with expectations\nThe urban jobless rate was 5.2% in March, dropping from 5.4% in the previous month\nThe surprise improvement in the industrial sector is in line with a surge in exports in March. The production of computers and other electronics picked up, soaring 13% last month from a year ago. Steel, cement and electricity output all accelerated, also supported by the government’s push to build infrastructure projects early this year.\nFor consumption, home appliances and furniture led the expansion with sales growing about 30% in March from a year ago, thanks to government subsidies. However, some unsubsidized goods such as cosmetics and clothing expanded only modestly, suggesting potential weakness in underlying sentiment.\nCatering spending accelerated to the fastest in a year, as a number of local governments rolled out discount vouchers to encourage dining out and tourism spending.\nThe government is increasingly looking at services as a potential source for growth after previously focusing measures on boosting spending on goods. In a work plan released Wednesday, authorities including the Ministry of Commerce listed 48 measures to expand household spending in catering, health care, entertainment and tourism and sports.\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n“Looking ahead, the picture looks a lot more challenging, with high US tariffs likely to slam external demand. We expect policymakers to step up stimulus urgently, front-loading this year’s big budget and cutting rates and reserve requirements.”\n— Chang Shu and David Qu\nRead the full note here.\nIn a sign of an imbalance between supply and demand, the economy continued to suffer from persisting deflation. The GDP deflator — a broad measure of prices across the economy — declined for the eighth consecutive quarter. That’s the longest streak since the quarterly data began in 1993.\nHighlighting the urgency to shore up domestic demand, Premier Li Qiang visited a consumer goods exhibition in Beijing on Tuesday.\nHe called on business representatives to be “united” to overcome difficulties and actively diversify markets, including compensating export losses with domestic sales. Officials should make greater efforts to stabilize employment, boost people’s income and strength social security to encourage consumer spending, and guide companies to compete in a healthy way, he said.\nLi was also debriefed by the city government regarding progress in the purchases of unsold homes, pledging to “study and launch new supportive policies in a timely manner.” The property market is still far from reaching a turning point, Wednesday’s data showed.\n“China can only count on domestic consumption,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. “The retail sales figure is encouraging. Whether it can be sustainable depends on how fast and large the stimulus package will be.”\n--With assistance from Zhu Lin and Iris Ouyang.\n(Updates with more details, comments throughout.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nFaced with the fear of rising tariffs, importers continued to stock up on foreign goods, fueling a surge in February shipments.\n(Bloomberg) -- The Stellantis NV assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario, rises like an industrial temple on the city’s outskirts.

Revenue also rose at all of these banks. Trading revenue alone jumped 17% to more than $36 billion.\nMany banks said their consumer customers were still spending, defaults were still manageable, and businesses were not experiencing distress despite the uncertainty about the months ahead. None of the institutions with big Wall Street footprints updated their earnings outlooks for the rest of the year, either.\nWhat these results didn't include, however, was the volatile period that followed Trump's April 2 \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement, which took place two days after the quarter ended. Stocks and bonds plunged and have yet to fully recover, ushering in new uncertainty about the economy and the safety of US assets.\n\"We're surprised about the degree of ongoing firmwide strength at all 5 big banks ... and the more than expected upbeat views,\" said Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo in a Tuesday note.\n\"To us, it all says that events since Apr 2 can still be little more than a speed bump, so long as policy moves faster to help ease most of the uncertainty,\" he added, in reference to promised deregulation of the banking industry expected from the Trump administration.\nNot that banks and their top executives were entirely upbeat. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said that the prospect of a recession \"has increased.\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the economy faces \"considerable turbulence,\" with a recession as a \"likely outcome.\"\nIn such a scenario, he added, \"earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down.\"\nBut many bankers were noticeably more optimistic. The word \"recession\" did not come up once on Citigroup's Tuesday earnings calls with analysts. Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, also offered an optimistic vision of the current turmoil.\n\"When all is said and done, and longstanding trade imbalances and other structural shifts are behind us, the U.S. will still be the world's leading economy,\" she said in a statement with the bank's Tuesday earnings release.\nBrian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, went out of his way on Tuesday to note that his bank's research team doesn't see a recession happening in 2025.\nRead more: What is a recession, and how does it impact you?\nUS consumers, he added, keep \"pushing money into the economy,\" and the lender's business clients \"remain profitable, liquid and have strong results.\"\nBut \"nobody has a perfect crystal ball,\" Moynihan acknowledged, noting that \"we potentially face a changing economy in the future.\"\nSome banks even showed a rise in investment banking income during the first quarter, defying predictions of a slowdown. Executives acknowledged some deals were now on hold due to uncertainties, but many described the pullbacks as temporary rather than long-lasting.\n\"I'm saying pause versus delete,\" Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick told analysts of the current investment banking environment. \"We don't know whether the economy is going to contract.\"\nEven amid the optimism, there were signs that banks are preparing for harder times. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo (WFC) added $8.4 billion in provisions to account for future loan losses.\nThe figure was 29% higher than the year-ago period and 9% higher than the previous quarter.\n\"We're still in a cloudy period.

Brent crude futures fell 21 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $64.67 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 20 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $61.33.

But it's also part and parcel of the same volatility that's been a hallmark of the 2025 stock market and a lesson in the importance of a diversified portfolio of banks' business lines.\nThat these banks can up their profitability amid economic uncertainty and a lack of an anticipated IPO boom isn’t unique to volatile trading. A similar dynamic was at play earlier this year, when a major market narrative was whether the Fed would continue to ease rates. (The Fed cut rates in September, November, and December but has since paused.)\nFurther rate cuts would have curtailed banks’ lending margins, which were supercharged by the central bank’s years-long tightening campaign. But the big banks could have done just fine in a low-rate environment because they can lean on other commercial operations to cover revenue losses elsewhere.\nThe diversified nature of financial services allows the nation's biggest banks to profit even when the outlook grows darker. It's not clear how the American exceptionalism trade will unfold in the months ahead.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) stands against other key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes.\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer reacted to the partial tariff exemptions announced by the White House, interpreting them not as a full retreat, but as a strategic pause designed to avoid punishing American companies. He suggested the administration was being careful not to hand over competitive advantages to Southeast Asian rivals, particularly Samsung:\n“So what I saw today, and not to be facetious, but what I see is people saying, you know what, we’ve seen the downside. Maybe we can test it again. But the president has, I don’t want to say blink, because that’s nonsense. What the president did was say, OK, look, we’re not going to continue to punish American companies and give the green light to Korea. I don’t know if you heard Lutnick’s words. He was very specific. Southeast Asia. That’s Samsung. They didn’t want to give the ball to Samsung.”\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Hints at a Bigger Agenda Behind Tariffs and Breaks Down These 7 Stocks and Jim Cramer Reacts to the Surprise Market Surge and Highlights 8 Key Stocks.\nTurning to currency dynamics, Cramer pushed back on what he sees as misplaced panic over a weakening U.S. dollar. Instead, he argued that a softer dollar actually benefits American multinationals and gives long-needed relief to CFOs who’ve spent years blaming currency strength for lost market share:\n“Well, look, I’m not so certain I’m going to do a little contrary stuff on the dollar here. When we listen to conference calls, for the last four years, all we hear about is it would have been so much better if the dollar weren’t so strong. We keep losing share, the dollar’s too strong. Suddenly the dollar’s weaker, and now we start hearing all the downside, what, the bonds? I mean, I’m almost thinking that, I’m gonna put this out there, the people who are saying that it’s the end of the world, that the dollar is weaker, I think they have to go do some work boots on the ground. […] So suddenly the dollar’s weaker and we are petrified? These are people who have an agenda. And their agenda is to say, you know what matters more than anything else? Our hegemony from a strong dollar. And I don’t get it. If you’re in our business of picking stocks, you’re sick and tired of hearing CFOs say, we are done. We’ve got to stop this dollar rise.”\nCramer also gave his opinion about the rhetoric coming from Beijing, likening it to the Cold War-era paranoia of the 1960s and ’70s. He questioned whether a diplomatic breakthrough similar to Nixon’s historic visit to China is even possible under the current tone of U.S.-China relations:\n“But when I listen to the rhetoric from China, this is the 1968-72 rhetoric. It’s the kind of rhetoric that just says there’s never going to be a meeting. Is there a way to have a Nixon to China moment? Because as far as I’m concerned, this is just right now you’re on the verge of when I was a little boy and we kept thinking, when are they going to bomb us? I mean, that was the same rhetoric. When are they going to launch their nuclear weapons? I mean, that’s why we used to live in fear. That’s why we had cubbyholes. That’s why we used to put our heads in a cubbyhole, because the Chinese were going to bomb us if the Russians didn’t bomb us. This is the same sound.”\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on April 14th.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NYSE:GS) in the context of its latest earnings report, highlighting both its strengths and potential challenges. While the bank reported a strong quarter driven by equities trading revenue, Cramer noted that activity in investment banking remains muted due to macro uncertainty. Here is his full analysis:\n“Well, we need the buyback. Now, they did buy back 7 million shares with a $610 basis. You’re obviously nowhere near that. What Goldman excels at is helping clients in a time of turmoil. And they did great there, but net interest income was good too. But when you take a look at investment banking, look, they’re just debt underwriting. They’re just not making a lot of money in debt underwriting. […]\nOverall, GS ranks 7th on our list of key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes. While we acknowledge the potential of GS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Analysts at Bank of America, Piper Sandler, and Raymond James lowered their price targets for the chipmaker stock.\nApple's (AAPL) India suppliers shipped $2 billion worth of iPhones in March ahead of US President Trump's tariffs.\nWall Street's top financial firms, like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS), saw record-high trading revenue in the first quarter, driven by tariff-fueled market volatility.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.\nIt's now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Nvidia, Apple, and Wall Street banks. First up, several Wall Street firms cutting their price targets on Nvidia stock after the chip maker disclosed that it anticipates a $5.5 billion charge from new chip curbs. The US government told Nvidia earlier this month it would need a special license to export certain chips to China. Analysts at BFA Global Research, Piper Sandler, and Raymond James all lowering their price targets on the news. And also, Steve, what I also thought was really interesting here is an analyst over at City talking about how it's not just about Nvidia. This could also impact Broadcom. This could also impact other chip names in the space.\nWell, you're seeing them, you're seeing them sell off today. I mean, you know, AMD announced an $800 million charge along in there. Um, you know, Broadcom was trading lower this morning as well. ASML was trading lower, although they released earnings, but, but they're all, they're all part and parcel of this. This is not good news for the chip sector, because, you know, I, I don't mean to just sound like a broken record, but this is uncertainty, and uncertainty, the markets don't love uncertainty.\nWell, speaking, speaking of uncertainty, let's get to another name we're looking at. Apple's main suppliers in India shipping roughly $2 billion worth of iPhones in March ahead of President Trump's reciprocal tariffs announcement. That is according to new customs data. Smartphones have since secured a temporary reprieve from tariffs, but persistent tensions between the US and China threaten the iPhone maker's China-focused supply chain in the longer term. The Wall Street Journal reporting Apple is investigating moving some iPhone production to the US, but the process could take years, and CEO Tim Cook has said in the past that it would be difficult to find the skilled labor in America that's needed to build the smartphones. Treasury Secretary Scott Beson dismissed that comment and concern in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\nYou don't need a PhD in mechanical engineering to assemble an iPhone. So, I, I'm not sure why Tim Cook says that the skills aren't here.\nAnd Steve, I think what analysts who cover Apple might say and investors might say is that that skilled labor does take years to build up, and it's certainly something that allows Apple to turn out these iPhones incredibly quickly.\nWell, that's it. I mean, every, you know, labor now is not just, you know, pounding a hammer or nail. There, there's, there's, there's intricacies in the supply chain. You know, I, I know that, you know, the commerce secretary with his comment, you know, we're going to have lots of people screwing tiny little screws into things. That's not what people really want. You know, we want the high-tech value-added manufacturing because, quite frankly, our cost basis is higher. So, if there's value-added stuff to be done, that's great. If it's just, if it's just bringing low-skilled labor, bringing back low-skilled jobs, that's not necessarily, you know, I understand the need for that, particularly maybe in some strategic industries, but overall, I think we want people bringing a skill set to it. You know, I saw a statistic, this was posted on, on, on Twitter by my friend Frank Luntz who I trust. Um, and he got the statistics from the Cato Institute. 80% of the people when asked, said, do you want more manufacturing in the US? 80% said yes. When asked, would you take a factory job? 75% said no. 23% said yes. The other two said I already have a factory job. So, it, it's, you know, it's one of these, it's nice in theory, but in practice, um, you know, you need skilled, the people who are going to take these jobs, by definition, are really going to be skilled labor. Not, not just, you know, people, not just, you know, automatons screwing in screws.\nYeah. Right. The price that they're requiring for their labor requires it to be skilled. All right. Finally, trading desks at some of the biggest names in banking crashed in, cashed in, rather, on market volatility in the most recent quarter. And that is not including the past two weeks, which fell outside of that reporting period. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Goldman, all seeing record equity trading revenue during the quarter. Despite the blockbuster results, executives did express some caution about the current macro backdrop. JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon warning of considerable turbulence roiling the US economy. Well, Goldman's David Solomon said the prospects of a recession had increased. You couldn't pay Solomon to mention the word tariffs, but he did semi-maybe allude to it in that comment. Is this trading revenue for banks a signal of strength in your view, Steve? Or is this something that can kind of hide any economic macro concerns?\nKind of the latter. You know, I remember I spent the bulk of my career as an option trader, and I used, I loved environments like this. Um, you know, and to Jamie Dimon's comment, you know, about turbulence, you know, I always described VIX as sort of the price of a parachute when the plane hits turbulence at some level. You know, people want that protection. But here's what happens during volatility with, if you're an active trader. You widen your spreads, you shrink your sizes. So, effectively that really impairs liquidity, but if you're the person trading off those bid offs, bid-ask spreads, each trade you do is more profitable. And so, yes, that leads to the trading desks making more money, but really, you know, analysts typically discount that over time. It's actually a little odd this quarter that the analysts are very happy that the banks are making all this money trading because for years, again, as a trader at a publicly traded firm, the analysts were always very dismissive when we had a good quarter.\nYeah. Right, right, because it's potentially not a sign of continued gains for, for the banks. Steve, thank you so much for sticking with us.

(NYSE:GS) just kicked off its latest first-quarter results with some very strong numbers. Goldman Sachs Group beat earnings, with revenues hitting US$15b, ahead of expectations, and statutory earnings per share outperforming analyst reckonings by a solid 15%. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.\nOur free stock report includes 2 warning signs investors should be aware of before investing in Goldman Sachs Group. Read for free now.\nTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Goldman Sachs Group from 16 analysts is for revenues of US$55.2b in 2025. If met, it would imply a modest 4.1% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to increase 2.3% to US$44.52. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$56.4b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$45.10 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.\n See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group \nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$592. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Goldman Sachs Group analyst has a price target of US$720 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$490. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The analysts are definitely expecting Goldman Sachs Group's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 5.5% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 2.7% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 5.2% annually. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Goldman Sachs Group is expected to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$592, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have forecasts for Goldman Sachs Group going out to 2027, and you can see them free on our platform here.\nHowever, before you get too enthused, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group that you should be aware of.\nHave feedback on this article?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in.\nAs we recently discussed in another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’s Berkshire picks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.\nOverall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio.\nAn aerial view of an oil rig at sunrise, emphasizing the power of the natural gas transportation industry.\nTo compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nGoldman Sachs' Q4 2024 Stake Value: $1,795,751,044\nP/E Ratio as of April 11: 12.23\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 37\nEnergy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) is a Texas-based company that operates a massive network of pipelines and facilities to transport, store, and process natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. As of the fourth quarter of 2024, Goldman Sachs holds 91.6 million shares of ET valued at $1.79 billion. It is one of the best Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in. On March 25, UBS maintained a Buy rating on Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) with a $24 price target, signaling strong belief in the company’s continued growth and strategic improvements.\nEnergy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) reported its Q4 results, with net income coming in at $1.08 billion. The adjusted EBITDA for the quarter stood at $3.88 billion, up from $3.60 billion in Q4 2023. Distributable cash flow came in at $1.98 billion. In December 2024, the company raised capacity on the Sabina 2 pipeline and Grey Wolf plant and launched the first of eight natural gas power units to support its Texas operations. ET forecasts 2025 adjusted EBITDA to fall between $16.1 billion and $16.5 billion.\nOn January 28, 2025, Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.325 per share, a 0.8% increase from its prior dividend of $0.323.

David Abrams’ Abrams Capital Management was a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 17.8 million shares worth $349.3 million.\nOverall, ET ranks 11th among the Goldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks. While we acknowledge the potential of value stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in.\nAs we recently discussed in another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’s Berkshire picks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.\nOverall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio.\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\nTo compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nGoldman Sachs' Q4 2024 Stake Value: $2,504,575,163\nP/E Ratio as of April 11: 12.85\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), an American multinational oil and gas titan, is one of the best Goldman Sachs value stocks. The investment firm holds 6.5 million shares of XOM worth $2.5 billion as of Q4 2024. On April 4, TD Cowen reiterated a Buy rating on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) but trimmed the price target from $128 to $125. While the company’s financial outlook has slightly shifted, analysts at TD Cowen remain confident in Exxon’s performance and share buyback plans, even if commodity prices dip. They still see it as one of the strongest picks in the energy sector.\nIn 2024, ExxonMobil reported $33.7 billion in earnings, slightly less than last year’s $36 billion. The company generated $55 billion in cash from operations and returned $36 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. It also led the industry in shareholder returns over the past 1, 3, and 5 years. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) plans to maintain its $20 billion annual share repurchase program through 2026. XOM raised its dividend for the 42nd straight year and ended 2024 with a $23.2 billion cash balance and low debt levels.\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has remodeled its oil and gas portfolio by discarding assets worth $15 billion and focusing on resources like the Permian Basin, Guyana, and LNG. The company’s full-year production came in at 4.3 million BOED, which can potentially reach 5.4 million BOED by 2030. The Pioneer acquisition boosted its Permian position, and innovation is improving recovery rates. XOM also plans to double its LNG capacity through projects in the United States, Papua New Guinea, and Mozambique.\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 104 hedge funds held long positions in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), compared to 86 funds in the earlier quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management was a significant stakeholder of the company, with 8.6 million shares valued at roughly $934 million.\nOverall, XOM ranks 6th among the Goldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks. While we acknowledge the potential of value stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

We've been talking about the Haynesville Shale and some of the things that Halliburton brings to it and some of the difficulties that the shale brings here. So Neil, do you want to talk a little bit about what Halliburton is doing in the shale and why it's difficult here?\nNeil Modeland, senior business technology development manager, Halliburton: Yeah, I think if you look at the Haynesville in general, we've talked about earlier going to longer laterals and more profit intensity than really any other play in North American land. Take a step back and look at what we're doing at Halliburton. We're really trying to minimize some of the costs associated with doing those huge completions in the Haynesville. So what can we do as a frac service provider to pull out some of those costs? One of those things is electrification. So we've got our ZEUS e-fleet [electric fleet] portfolio, and 40% of our fleets in North America are actually running e-fleets.\nRS: And you said that's going up.\nNM: Yes, and in 2025 we actually expect that to end the year with 50% on that. And really all of our dedicated fleets in the Haynesville currently are e-fleets. That's really helped on driving out some of the costs on a couple of different fronts.\nOne [is] just replacing diesel with natural gas, right? You have got a lower cost commodity, and in the Haynesville we have field gas that we can actually burn to create the power generation to power the e-fleets. And that's going to be your total lowest total cost of ownership of any power generation is just burning the field gas. So we have that plentiful in the Haynesville, so that's going to lower the cost. But also the maintenance schedule and just the simplicity of the maintenance is better with our ZEUS fleet. In fact, last month our ZEUS fleets or electric fleets pumped 11% more horsepower hours on average than any of our diesel fleets. That comes because of more simplistic maintenance and just more uptime pumping these jobs and being able to do that better.\nRS: More uptime and less maintenance, that sounds like something I would also want for my car or something like that. But Halliburton is also doing a lot of work with automation, right?\nNM: Yeah. And really the e-fleets have been a good platform for that. Just the simplicity of control and then the full fleet control through our OCTIV platform has allowed us to step into automation. So last year we commercialized Auto Frac, which is really kind of push-button frac. We upload a typical frac schedule an operator would give us. We then sit down with the operator and talk through ‘what parameters, what target pressure would you like, max rate, target rate, how would you like to ramp up the stage, how would you like to bring down the stage?’ Then once all that's loaded in, it's kind of press button and here you go. So there's your automated frac. If you're riding top pressure, as your pressure breaks down, your rate will increase. That's very common in the Haynesville that we'll see that. We actually commercialized the Auto Frac in the Haynesville last year as well. To put it in perspective, the time savings we're seeing through that automation versus a manual operator, we're seeing about 10 minutes on average. In fact, the Bossier Shale versus the Haynesville Shale is a little more finicky. We actually see a closer to 15 minutes saved per stage pumping time versus a manual operator versus what we're doing with automation.\nRS: And we talked about 15 minutes, but it's 15 minutes plus 15 minutes plus times, times, times.\nNM: Yeah. 15 minutes times a hundred stages of, well, a two well pad and then several pads throughout the year, all of a sudden you have enough time to actually have that frac fleet go pump another well or two right by the end of the year.\nRS: Well fantastic. Thank you for being here and talking with us, and I really appreciate you just being part of the program.\nNM: My pleasure. Thanks for having.\nRS: Thank you.\nCaterpillar (CAT) on Tuesday named Joseph Creed as the company's next chief executive, succeeding D.\nHalliburton (HAL) doesn't possess the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely earnings beat in its upcoming report.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 22, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nThis provider of drilling services to oil and gas operators is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -21.1%.\nRevenues are expected to be $5.26 billion, down 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nFor Halliburton, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.03%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Halliburton will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Halliburton would post earnings of $0.70 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.70, delivering no surprise.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

(LBRT), which Wright led until his appointment to Trump’s cabinet, has tumbled 43% this year, one of the most precipitous declines among US energy stocks. The value of Wright’s stake in Liberty has fallen by nearly half to about $30 million over that period.\nLiberty’s rout is a warning that all is not well in America’s shale patch, despite Trump’s pledge to achieve “energy dominance.” Oil field servicers often provide the first indication of an industry downturn because they’re the ones hired to drill and frack new wells. After the trade war and OPEC’s recent decision to hike production knee-capped crude prices, investors expect US shale producers to avoid pumping more barrels into an oversupplied market.\nA drop in spending on services means US oil production could stall, or even decline this year, for the first time since the pandemic. So far, servicers are getting the brunt of the impact from tariff fears: An index of the companies has slid 28% this year, compared with 7% for oil and gas producers.\n“It’s just going to be painful,” said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at energy-focused financial services firm Pickering Energy Partners. “What comes next, and we’ve already heard whispers of this, it will be slowing down of drilling activity, releasing frack crews.”\nLiberty is due to kick off earnings season for oil field servicers on Wednesday after the market closes, with larger rivals Halliburton Co. (HAL), Baker Hughes Co. (BKR) and SLB (SLB) to follow next week.\nOil field service companies are largely dependent on producer spending on drilling and fracking new wells for their income, leaving them uniquely vulnerable to downturns. Producers like Diamondback Energy Inc. and Devon Energy Corp., by contrast, can continue to earn revenue from their existing wells. Plus, they have the option of hedging oil prices and renegotiating for lower-cost drilling contracts.\nEven before tariffs, servicers had been suffering from lower demand as shale producers become more efficient, which means fewer drilling days and workers to do the same job. Investors will find out soon if further cuts are coming as contracts inked before the trade war expire and producers respond to the slump in crude prices.\nWest Texas Intermediate crude oil, the US benchmark, closed at $61.33 on Tuesday, down 14% this year.\n“We would not be surprised to see US oil output decline” if low prices persist, Barclays Plc analysts led by Amarpreet Singh wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\nA representative for Liberty declined to comment, citing a mandated quiet period ahead of the company’s earnings release. Wright didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The energy secretary did, however, put a positive spin on the market in an interview with Bloomberg TV on April 11. Trump’s election gave a “green light” to increase production, with pledges to roll back regulation and expand oil lease sales and permitting, he said.\n“Now there is extra fear of world economic growth in the next few months among the tariffs dialogue,” he said. “The marketplace may be discounting the wrong answer here. We will see very positive economic growth in the next few years.”\nInvestors and analysts aren’t convinced. US revenue for the five biggest frack providers is expected to drop by almost $1 billion this year, a 5% decline and the second consecutive annual drop, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last week, producers idled oil rigs in US shale fields at the fastest pace in almost two years.\nUS shale is on the brink of major cutbacks, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM). The industry will cut 50 oil rigs at a sustained $60 a barrel WTI price, reducing production by half a million barrels a day, analysts led by Arun Jayaram wrote in a note this week. If prices drop to $55 a barrel, the impact doubles, the analysts said.\nPrices falling below $60 “will create softness that’s going to cost us jobs,” said T.M. “Roe” Patterson, co-founder and managing partner at private equity fund Marauder Capital. “We’re going stack rigs and we’re going to see an industry pullback,” Patterson said.\nStill, oil field servicers are unlikely to go bankrupt in droves like they did during the 2014 and 2020 downturns. Balance sheets are much healthier after the pandemic as companies focus on capital discipline, said Jeff Krimmel, owner of energy strategy consulting firm Krimmel Strategy Group.\n“It’s not like you’re going to see huge swaths of the sector struggling with liquidity, struggling to pay their bills,” Krimmel said. “For the ones that are best differentiated with technology, this might actually be an opportunity for them to make a more compelling case even than they have to this point.”\nFor his part, Wright wants the oil patch to focus on the benefits he says the Trump administration will bring over the long term. Trump has been clear about his desire for more crude output and lower prices, which will help bring “prosperity at home and peace abroad,” Wright said.\nPredictions “of the demise of demand growth for oil are older than I am,” he said in the Bloomberg TV interview. “A long-term growth rate of oil has been going on for decades. I don’t see any big change in that in the foreseeable future.”\nBut concerns about demand are riding high in an industry that overwhelmingly supported Trump with cash and votes in his run for the White House.\n“I would like to see the administration do a little more to put some consistency in their messaging around crude oil and to backstop pricing a little bit,” Patterson said. “Frankly, everything they’re saying right now is kind of counterintuitive.”\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nDividends are one of the best benefits to being a shareholder, but finding a great dividend stock is no easy task.

Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET) is on the bubble to qualify for this list.  This midstream energy leader's business should hold up quite well even if President Trump's steep tariffs remain in place.\nOil prices have tumbled this year.  Lower crude prices will impact oil company cash flows.  Three oil companies that can still thrive in the current environment are Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX).\nWith President Donald Trump announcing a wide set of tariffs, there could be increased costs for a range of companies.

NBR have reached a breakthrough by completing the first fully automated surface and subsurface execution of rotary and slide drilling operations in Oman. This breakthrough sets a new standard for land-based drilling, showcasing the power of advanced digital technologies to improve efficiency and performance in the oil and energy sector.\nAt the core of this technological feat lies the powerful integration of Halliburton’s LOGIX automation platform and Nabors' SmartROS rig operating system. Together, these cutting-edge solutions enabled a closed-loop drilling system that dramatically enhanced operational efficiency, consistency and real-time decision-making. Wells delivered ahead of schedule, with higher average rates of penetration and reduced non-productive time, set a benchmark for future digital drilling initiatives.\n \nThis achievement is not just a technical milestone, it is a statement of leadership. Halliburton and Nabors, a Hamilton-based oil and gas drilling company, have showcased how synergized digital ecosystems can transform complex drilling operations into streamlined, autonomous processes. The integration of advanced real-time analytics, remote control and data-driven orchestration allowed for seamless management of drilling parameters, setting a new standard for precision and performance.\nSteve Haden, senior VP of Project Management at Halliburton, highlighted the success of the breakthrough in improving efficiency, consistency and reliability. The wells were completed ahead of schedule, with better drilling rates and less downtime, showcasing the Houston, TX-based oil and gas equipment and services company’s leadership in drilling automation.\n \nWhat makes this accomplishment even more remarkable is its immediate impact on well construction timelines. The automation of both rotary and slide drilling not only optimized performance but also reduced drilling time, a critical factor in improving the economic viability of oil and gas projects in the region. By minimizing human intervention and maximizing system intelligence, Halliburton and Nabors proved that digital automation is not a vision for the future, rather, it is a powerful solution available today.\n \nThe strategic importance of this development goes far beyond a single project in Oman. As global energy demands grow, the need for faster, safer and more cost-effective drilling operations becomes paramount. This milestone sets a precedent not only for the Middle East, a hub for oil and gas activity, but also for global markets looking to adopt automated, data-centric drilling solutions. By leveraging the power of digital platforms like LOGIX and SmartROS, Halliburton and Nabors have created a model that other operators can replicate, enhancing global competitiveness and supporting a transition toward more intelligent energy exploration.\n \nWhat comes next is a natural progression toward full autonomy. With the success in Oman serving as a proof of concept, it is clear that digitally enabled rigs, capable of self-optimizing in real time, are no longer science fiction. These are fast becoming the industry standard. From enhancing safety through remote operations to enabling faster learning curves via integrated experience management, the benefits of automation span across every facet of drilling. This is not just a win for Halliburton and Nabors, it is a win for the entire sector and the regions that depend on efficient resource development.\n \nThe collaboration between Halliburton and Nabors in Oman marks a turning point in the future of drilling. This project proves that digital transformation can deliver faster, smarter and more efficient results. As the industry embraces automation, this achievement serves as a powerful example of what is possible when innovation and collaboration drive the way forward.\n \nCurrently, HAL and NBR each has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at some better-ranked stocks like Archrock, Inc.

This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nFor Oceaneering International, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +4.23%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination indicates that Oceaneering International will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Oceaneering International would post earnings of $0.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.37, delivering a surprise of -17.78%.\nThe company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nOceaneering International appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nHalliburton (HAL), another stock in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.60 for the quarter ended March 2025. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -21.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.26 billion, down 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Halliburton has been revised 1% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.03%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Halliburton will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Currently the net annual result is approximately $100 million negative for our business,\" CEO William Oplinger said during a post-earnings conference call.  The aluminum producer said the tariffs on Canadian imports had cost the company roughly $20 million in the first quarter, ended March 31.\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors who may have been hoping the Federal Reserve is poised to come to the aid of tariff-rattled markets took away an unwelcome message from the central bank's chief on Wednesday: the Fed may be in a bind.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank would wait for more data on the economy's direction before changing interest rates.  Speaking to the Economic Club of Chicago, he noted that there was a potentially tough situation developing for the Fed in which inflation is pushed higher by tariffs while growth and potentially, employment, weaken.\nChinese online marketplace Temu and fast-fashion retailer Shein, two of the biggest advertisers on U.S. social media, are sharply cutting their U.S. digital ad spending, industry data show, in a blow to tech companies such as Meta's Facebook and YouTube.

U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order earlier this month threatens this business.\nChina-founded e-commerce sites Temu and Shein say they plan to raise prices for U.S. customers starting next week, a ripple effect from President Donald Trump's attempts to correct the trade imbalance between the world's two largest economies by imposing a sky-high tariff on goods shipped from China.  Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, which is now based in Singapore, said in separate but nearly identical notices that their operating expenses have gone up “due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs.”  Both companies said they would be making “price adjustments” starting April 25, although neither provided details about the size of the increases.\nClark Howard, a prominent consumer finance expert, entrepreneur, author and radio host, challenges the conventional wisdom that striving for an 800 credit score (or higher) is a universally wise...\nTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results\nSign in to access your portfolio\n\n\n\nTry again."

The most substantial impact comes from tariffs against China and retaliatory tariffs from China, said Joseph Wolk, Johnson & Johnson's chief financial officer, in a conference call with analysts following the company's latest earnings results.\nThe company's estimate also includes the impact from tariffs on aluminum and steel, along with tariffs against key U.S. trading partners Canada and Mexico. Johnson & Johnson said that contractual agreements already in place limit its leverage on price increases that could potentially soften the impact.\nThe cost estimate does not include possible tariffs on imports of pharmaceuticals. The Trump administration has launched an investigation into imports of pharmaceuticals, which is a step towards imposing tariffs.\nTariffs, especially on pharmaceutical products, could lead to supply chain issues and shortages, said CEO Joaquin Duato. He said the best way to build up manufacturing in the U.S. is through tax policy, not tariffs.\nThe company is investing more than $55 billion over the next four years with the goal of making all of its advanced medicines that are used in the U.S., within the U.S.\nBofA analyst Tim Anderson notes Pfizer (PFE) announced danuglipron, an oral GLP-1 obesity, is being discontinued, following a case of liver injury seen in the phase 1 study. The firm points out that it has argued that this program has received almost too much attention – not because obesity isn’t important, but because this was only phase 1 data. Without danuglipron, Pfizer’s obesity pipeline now consists of a GIP receptor antagonist in phase 2 and a phase 1 oral GLP-1 in T2D with Nxera Pharma.\nFutures edged down Tuesday morning, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow trading just below break-even, as investors braced for a flurry of corporate earnings. The muted open followed Monday’s tech-led rally, which briefly masked deeper market jitters tied to tariffs and macro uncertainty.\nJohnson & Johnson is holding its earnings outlook steady despite President Donald Trump signaling he could put tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry. The administration announced earlier it would conduct an investigation into drug imports. That move is widely seen as a first step toward imposing new levies. Earnings and revenue both beat estimates for the quarter. Johnson & Johnson CFO Joe Wolk joined Bloomberg Open Interest to talk about how tariffs could hit the industry and the drug maker's bottom line.\nInsurance bellwether Travelers' first-quarter profit exceeded analysts' expectations on Wednesday, as strong underwriting gains helped soften the hit from over $2 billion of catastrophe losses driven by the Los Angeles wildfires.  The results shed a light on the fallout from one of the costliest natural disasters in California's history, which claimed several lives and destroyed property, with some estimates pegging the economic losses at $250 billion.  Travelers' catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, touched a record $2.27 billion for the quarter ended March 31, compared with $712 million a year earlier.\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), on Tuesday, reported a first-quarter 2025 adjusted EPS of $2.77, up 2.2% year over year, beating the consensus of $2.60. The pharmaceutical giant reported sales of $21.89 billion, up 2.4% year over year and beating the consensus of $21.58 billion. Operational growth was 4.2%, and adjusted operational growth was 3.3%. Innovative Medicine sales increased 2.3% or 4.2 operationally to $13.90 billion.

Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research head of the healthcare business unit Asad Haider joins Catalysts with Madison Mills and StoneX senior adviser Jon Hilsenrath to take a closer look at the earnings print and Johnson & Johnson's position as US President Trump pushes for tariffs on pharmaceutical imports.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.\nJohnson & Johnson topped the street's expectations in its latest quarter, thanks to strong cancer drug sales during the 3-month period. The company boosted its full-year sales outlook, but tempered expectations for its adjusted operational profit, citing the impact of a recent acquisition and, of course, tariffs. President Trump has warned that levies will be placed on the sector very soon. Joining us now to discuss is Saad Hater, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research Head of the Healthcare Business Unit. Saad, great to speak with you. Let's start on Johnson & Johnson maintaining the EPS outlook. How were they able to do that in your view and what are your other big takeaways?\nYeah, thanks for having me. Um so, there there were some questions. I mean, overall, we thought that the quarter was actually very encouraging and very much in line with the thesis uh that we have on Johnson & Johnson. And just to zoom out for a second, we upgraded the stock to buy last week, uh based on our view that the innovative medicine business is going to continue to surprise on the upside and show encouraging trends. And that's really what you saw. Now, there was some gross margin related pressure, um which they cited, uh they attributed to Part D dynamics. This is the first quarter that the pharma industry is going to see uh some headwinds from the inflation reduction act, uh particularly related to Part D. Uh and there were also some tariff related costs that they that they talked about, um about $400 million that they attributed to the MedTech business. But beneath the hood, uh the pharma business did really well and their operating margins actually beat because they flex the P&L by cutting costs and cutting R&D. And to us, that was actually a very encouraging sign. And I think the combination of those things, along with a little bit of an FX tailwind, had them maintain uh the earnings for the year.\nAnd how are you thinking about the impact of tariffs, both on on Johnson & Johnson, and then just moving forward? Because they are the first pharma name to report, what does the what what did their results tell you about how the rest of the industry might be impacted by tariffs as well?\nWell, the short answer is not much. And I think uh it's still all very uncertain. I think uh we all have been waiting to see what the announcement for tariffs is. I think what's known, of course, is that uh the the pharmaceutical industry is going to have be tariffed, the way semiconductors and autos and several other industries are. Uh we've been waiting for this for a while. What we also know is that there has already been a section 232 investigation that has begun. Uh and uh depending on how that goes, uh what we're all going to be waiting for is to see what level of tariffs are going to be applied to the industry. And uh at this point, I just don't think we have a lot of clarity on any of that. And so, what that's been doing is creating a lot of uncertainty across the entire pharmaceutical sector. It's making people question the traditional orthodoxy around the margin structure and the profitability of this sector. But we just don't know a lot right now, and I think it would be too early for me to speculate on where this all lands. Uh but this is a cloud that the sector that it's an overhang on the sector. And until we get a real off-ramp, uh it's going to be hard to see how that uh um you know, how that overhang goes away.\nAnd Saad, my guest host, John Hilsenrath, is still with me. John, you got a question for Saad?\nSaad, you you talk about J&J flexing their earnings muscle by cutting costs and cutting R&D. Uh I'm listening to hear how all of this affects the economy, and that sounds like bad news to me.\nWell, I don't think it's I don't think it's bad news necessarily. I mean, I think we don't we don't really know uh line items on what exactly they did on the SG&A and the R&D side. I think it just speaks a little bit to the leverage that they have across the P&L to uh you know, make these types of investments. I think what's more interesting is just the way that Johnson & Johnson is has been responding, as I expect others to to to these tariff threats, which is uh building uh infrastructure, manufacturing facilities in the US. I think everyone saw that uh about 3 weeks ago, they announced a $55 billion manufacturing commitment to the US that is higher, that's about 25% higher than what they had initially said they'd do. Uh they opened a new facility in North Carolina, which they are going to use to manufacture in the US. And there's three other facilities that they're going to bring on the manufacturing side that are yet to come. So, I think those types of measures are probably more important for, as far as the overall economy goes, than them, these pharma companies, really flexing the the the the P&L in there with with things like SG&A and and R&D.\nYeah, Saad, I'm also curious how you're thinking about the impact of China and any China demand on this. John, I wonder if you have a question to that end as well.\nWell, I I mean, I'm I'm interested in in China, and I'm also interested in, you know, the risk that that they cut off supply chains and that that affects the supply chain of the pharma industry.\nI mean, John, I just don't think we know. I just think it's just too early to speculate how this all plays out. Um like I said, uh there are we are right now navigating navigating a period in the pharmaceutical sector where there are just a lot more questions than there are answers. I think it would be too premature for me to speculate uh on, you know, where uh what gets tariffed, what happens with China, what happens with demand. Um but our focus is just on fundamentals, and our call on J&J really has to do with the fact that their pharma business and some of the new product cycles within their pharma business are actually underappreciated, based on some of the diligence that we've done. And once this blows through, I mean, that's really where we'd be guiding investors.\nJohnson & Johnson plans to seek a U.S. indication for multiple general surgery procedures, including gastric bypass, which was performed in the clinical trial.\nNew tariffs, primarily on medical technology products, are projected to add $400 million in costs this year, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said.\nJohnson & Johnson is holding its earnings outlook steady despite President Donald Trump signaling he could put tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry.

These events occurred alongside solid earnings reports, with a significant rise in net income and earnings per share compared to the previous year. While the company's stock price increased by 6.64% over the last quarter, the broader market also trended upward, climbing 5.9% in the past year. These company developments likely complemented the overall market movements and investor sentiment, rather than diverging from broader trends.\nYou should learn about the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Johnson & Johnson.\nOutshine the giants: these 25 early-stage AI stocks could fund your retirement.\nJohnson & Johnson's recent dividend increase and positive Phase 3 clinical data for icotrokinra could significantly bolster investor confidence by enhancing perceptions of future earnings potential and revenue growth. The company's total return, including dividends, was 17.11% over the past five years, indicating steady but moderate financial performance. This is set against the backdrop of a one-year underperformance relative to the US Pharmaceuticals industry's 7% decline.\nLooking forward, these announcements could positively influence earnings forecasts, especially with expected boosts from TREMFYA and RYBREVANT within the Innovative Medicine segment. This aligns with strategic acquisitions and product launches that have been projected to grow revenue and expand market footprint. Despite these gains, competition and economic pressures remain considerations, particularly in international markets like China.\nCurrently trading at US$150, the share price reflects a modest discount to the analyst consensus price target of US$171.11. This implies potential upside and suggests market expectations are still reconciling with Johnson & Johnson's future growth prospects. Revenue and earnings forecasts will likely incorporate these developments, while still being mindful of existing risks such as biosimilar competition and macroeconomic pressures.\nReview our historical performance report to gain insights into Johnson & Johnson's track record.\n This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "Title: J&J projects $400m tariff hit but raises sales outlook\nDate: 2025-04-15 18:40\nURL: https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/jj-projects-400m-tariff-hit-but-raises-sales-outlook/?.tsrc=rss\nContent:\nJ&J is projecting a $400m hit due to US tariffs in 2025, but reaffirmed its profit outlook while raising its sales forecast. \nJohnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine (J&J) addressed the potential impact of pharmaceutical tariffs during its Q1 2025 earnings call, as the US government intensifies its scrutiny of foreign drug supply chains. The company’s chief financial officer Joseph Wolk said the company expects a $400m cost tied to newly proposed and existing tariffs, with the largest burden stemming from China’s retaliatory duties on US-origin goods.\nWith the possibility of pharma-specific tariffs looming and the Department of Commerce announcing the launch of a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceutical imports on 14 April, investors were watching closely for commentary from J&J on US trade policy. The investigation gives President Donald Trump 90 days to determine whether tariffs should be imposed on national security grounds.\n\n                The gold standard of business intelligence.\n            \n\n                    Find out more\n                    \n\n\n\n\nCEO Joaquin Duato said the company is analysing the Section 232 process, noting it had been anticipated and would be treated as a normal regulatory development. “It’s important that companies in healthcare partner with the administration to look to mitigate some of the vulnerabilities that exist today in our healthcare supply chain,” Duato said.\n“We plan to do it in this process to make sure that we have enough manufacturing capacity here in the US to be able to address multiple scenarios. We want to be deferential to the administration and their process,” he added.\nMany large pharma companies like MSD and Novartis have announced plans to increase manufacturing activity in the US against the backdrop of these tariff announcements, and J&J announced its own $55m US investment in March 2025.\n“Since President Trump’s 2017 tax reform, the investment in manufacturing – both in medtech and in pharmaceuticals – has significantly increased. When you think about our recent announcement of investing $55bn over the next four years at the completion of this investment plan, essentially all our advanced medicines that are used in the US will be manufactured in the US,” said Duato.\nJ&J indicated that most of the projected $400m tariff impact will affect its Medtech division. The total includes duties from China, as well as import tariffs from Mexico and Canada not excluded under the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). Wolk noted that mitigation strategies are limited due to existing price controls and contractual agreements, particularly in the pharmaceutical segment. Tariff-related costs will primarily be recorded as inventory before impacting future profit and loss statements.\nDespite the headwinds, J&J posted Q1 results above analyst expectations. Revenue for the quarter rose by 2.4% to $21.9bn, with operational growth of 4.2% and adjusted operational growth of 3.3%. Oncology products, including multiple myeloma drug Darzalex (daratumumab), remained key contributors.\nThe company raised its 2025 sales forecast by $700m to $92bn at the midpoint, reflecting the addition of Caplyta (lumateperone) following its $14.6bn acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies. However, J&J lowered its adjusted operational EPS growth projection to 6.2%, down from 8.7%, citing dilution from the acquisition. Adjusted reported EPS growth remains unchanged at 6.2%, consistent with guidance first issued in January 2025.\nJ&J also reported regulatory approvals for two key therapies in 1Q: the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared Tremfya (guselkumab) for Crohn’s disease, and the European Commission (EC) approved Rybrevant (amivantamab-vmjw) for specific lung cancer indications.\nMedtech operational sales rose 4.1%, with growth driven by cardiovascular and general surgery segments. Orthopaedics showed weakness, particularly in spine and sports medicine.\nLegal challenges remain ongoing. In April 2025, a Texas court blocked J&J’s attempt to resolve talc-related liabilities via a bankruptcy filing by its subsidiary Red River Talc. J&J previously expressed its intention to defend itself against the claims, which it insists are “meritless” and “premised on junk science”. J&J intends to recover up to $7bn from legal reserves.\n\n\n                The gold standard of business intelligence.\n            \n\n\n                    Find out more\n                    \n\n\n\n\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                        Pharma Technology Focus : Pharmaceutical Technology Focus (monthly)                                                                                                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                Thematic Take (monthly)                                                                                                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit our Privacy Policy for more information about our services, how we may use, process and share your personal data, including information on your rights in respect of your personal data and how you can unsubscribe from future marketing communications.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\nOn Friday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer outlined what investors should focus on in the week, especially pointing to earnings reports from major banks.\n“Rumor, innuendo, intrigue these are the stuff of great novels, of fabulous miniseries, riveting plays, and now they’re the stuff of the stock market.”\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks and 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently.\nHe noted the chaotic nature of the current environment and remarked that “this tape has it all,” and emphasized how unpredictable developments from the White House have added to the turbulence. Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes.\n“Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,” he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, “Except this isn’t an eight-part blockbuster, it’s our money.” Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday’s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic.\nCramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a “liberation day bottom,” a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, “Not sure, I’m just not sure.” He added:\n“Have you ever noticed the weekends don’t provide relaxation anymore because the president’s got advisors? He’s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He’s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime…. Monday’s trading, well, let’s just say that it looks like that it’s earning season so it’s gonna be even harder than usual.”\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Wolk said the estimated costs represent a \"worst-case scenario\" and take into account President Trump’s 90-day pause, China's retaliatory tariffs and the resumption of the U.S. tariffs.

Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Anjalee Khemlani joins Market Domination to show how the company's medical device business is feeling the pressure.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.\nJohnson & Johnson tops first quarter earnings estimates, but the pharma company expecting a tariff impact on business. And Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani joins us now with the very latest, Anj.\nThat's right, Josh. And we know that of course, tariffs are top of mind for the entire pharma sector as, we know, we heard the announcement from the administration yesterday about the specific pharmaceutical tariffs. Uh, Johnson & Johnson sort of bridges two gaps. It's it also sells medical devices and that includes to China. So that is where a lot of the impact comes from for the business. Just taking a quick look at the earnings, they did beat on both the revenue as well as earnings per share, but that doesn't seem to really have helped their stock. It's been trading largely flat, but, you know, slightly negative all day long. And that's because Wall Street is still waiting to hear about the final impacts. We took a look at what they said during the earnings call and they said they were expecting about $400 million in terms of impact and that's largely coming from those medical devices. I had a chance to catch up with CFO Joe Wolk earlier today and here's what he had to say specifically about where that $400 million is coming from. Take a listen.\nThe tariffs that we've included in that 400 million relate to products that are not exempt under USMCA, some of the aluminum and steel tariffs that currently exist and apply to our MedTech products, and then the China tariffs, both, uh, uh, from China as well as the retaliatory, uh, tariffs that China had levied upon us. That last piece makes up probably about 70% of the total $400 million. So those are products of origin here in the US being shipped to China, and that's the impact that we we actually have. So we'll have to see with respect to pharmaceutical tariffs.\nSo they're still waiting like the rest of the industry for the rest of the, you know, the other shoe to drop, essentially. And that's where things stand right now for, uh, for the medical devices. Uh, we've seen analyst notes all day talking about how they have less protection, uh, from China in particular, but also the Mexico, Canada, as you as they mentioned, or as he mentioned earlier, about the steel and aluminum there. Uh, looking at what's ahead and how to sort of, you know, wait for everything else to fall out for the year, I asked him how he's thinking about this, in particular how to, you know, run the company knowing that the the situation is still kind of fluid. And here's what Joe had to say.\nMy only role, I guess, as CFO at this point would be to look at the profitability of business. If these tariffs continue to escalate, then you just have to make decisions like we would in any other part of our business. And we're currently doing within our orthopedics and surgery portfolio, rationalizing skews that are on the less profitable and perhaps even unprofitable side, in either certain markets or certain product portfolios. And that would be no different.\nSo, as you can see, just looking at, uh, you know, rationalizing the business, and this is already impacting the company, the first of the major pharmaceuticals to report in this quarter. So we'll just have to wait and see how the rest stack up by comparison.\nAll right, thank you, Anj.

Despite recent gains, all three major indices remain well below their pre-April 2 levels, when President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements first rattled markets.\nRead more: Wall Street banks are cashing in on trade war chaos.\nAuto stocks fell despite fresh rumors of a possible reprieve on tariffs. Ford, GM, and Rivian each ended the day lower, following a new forecast from S&P Global Ratings (SPGI) projecting a 700,000-unit drop in annual U.S. car sales if tariffs move ahead. “Affordability challenges and elevated interest rates are already pressuring demand,” analysts wrote. “Tariffs would only exacerbate those headwinds.”\nTech and financial names led the upside among individual stocks. Palantir surged more than 6% following news that NATO finalized its purchase of the company’s AI-powered Maven Smart System. Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 5% amid ongoing activist investor pressure, and Netflix (NFLX) added nearly 5%. Bank of America and Citigroup also posted solid gains after beating first-quarter earnings expectations, fueled by strong trading revenue and consumer banking results.\nInvestors are now looking ahead to fresh earnings from United Airlines (UAL) and The Trade Desk (TTD), both due after the bell, and to a Wednesday slate that includes Abbott Labs (ABT) and U.S. Bancorp (USB)—reports that should offer further insight into consumer health and the state of regional lending.\nStocks opened higher Tuesday, with tech and bank names leading the charge as investors welcomed a morning packed with strong earnings and fresh deal buzz. Big banks were in rally mode: Citigroup, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs all ticked higher after posting better-than-expected results, fueled by strong trading revenues.\nPalantir Technologies jumped 4% after NATO finalized its purchase of the company’s AI-powered Maven Smart System — another boost for the defense-tech darling after Monday’s rally. Apple also edged higher, extending its 2% gain from Monday, which followed a surprise tariff exemption from the Trump administration.\nMeanwhile, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) caught a wave of investor enthusiasm after activist firm Elliott Investment Management revealed a $1.5 billion stake and backed the company’s newly announced strategic review. The broader market got a lift as chipmakers, software stocks, and AI plays rode the wave, with early signs pointing to a tech-led session and plenty of earnings drama still to come.\nAuto stocks gave back some of Monday’s gains, with Rivian (RIVN), Ford, and GM trading lower despite President Trump floating a potential delay in auto tariffs. “A US car with all US parts made in the US is a fictional tale,” analysts at Wedbush wrote, warning that the proposed tariffs — if not paused — could send the industry into “upside down mode” and trigger widespread supply-chain disruption.\nU.S. stock futures edged down Tuesday morning, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average trading just below the break-even line as investors braced for a flurry of corporate earnings.\nThe subdued start followed a tech-driven rally on Monday, a temporary lift amid lingering concerns around tariffs and broader economic uncertainty.\nGoldman Sachs (GS) kicked off the week’s earnings slate with a profit jump, even as CEO David Solomon warned of a “markedly different” environment in the current quarter. Echoing Solomon’s sentiments, in March, hedge funds unloaded global stocks at the fastest pace in over a decade — a sign that institutional investors may be growing more cautious as economic uncertainty deepens.\nTuesday’s earnings lineup includes Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and Rent the Runway (RENT) before the bell, offering a pulse check across finance, healthcare, and consumer spending.\nBank of America beat expectations in the first quarter, with EPS of $0.90 on $27.37 billion in revenue, lifted by a strong showing in its trading division. Like Goldman Sachs, the bank benefited from market volatility, which juiced results even as the broader economic outlook remains uncertain.\nLooking to Bank of America’s consumer banking division, revenue rose 3% to $10.5 billion, with combined credit and debit card spend hitting $228 billion — up 4% from a year ago. The bank added about 250,000 new consumer checking accounts, marking its 25th straight quarter of growth, and saw 4 billion digital logins, with 65% of sales now digitally enabled.\nStill, CEO Brian Moynihan struck a cautious tone, noting that “we potentially face a changing economy in the future.”\nCitigroup posted first-quarter 2025 net income of $4.1 billion, or $1.96 per share, on $21.6 billion in revenue — a 3% increase from a year ago. Growth was broad-based across all five core businesses, with standout performances in the markets and wealth divisions.\nU.S. personal banking revenue rose 2% to $5.2 billion, powered by gains in branded cards and retail banking, though partially offset by a drop in retail services. Net interest income climbed 6%, fueled by loan growth in branded cards and wider deposit spreads in its retail banking.\nJohnson & Johnson beat Wall Street expectations in the first quarter, reporting adjusted earnings per share of $2.77 on revenue of $21.89 billion. Sales of cancer drug Darzalex jumped 20% year over year to $3.24 billion, helping drive 4.2% growth in the company’s “innovative medicine” segment.\nThe healthcare giant raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $91.6 billion and $92.4 billion, reflecting the impact of its Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition and the addition of Caplyta, a treatment for bipolar depression. However, adjusted EPS guidance held steady at $10.50 to $10.70 as the company factors in tariffs, deal-related costs, and currency headwinds.\nJ&J also moved to reverse $7 billion previously set aside for talc-related legal settlements, after courts rejected its bankruptcy-based strategy for resolving lawsuits over its discontinued baby powder. The company maintains the claims are without merit and says it will defend them in state courts.\nDuring a television appearance on Monday, former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that Trump’s economic strategy is eroding global trust in U.S. financial assets, with volatility in Treasury yields reflecting broad investor unease.\nTreasury yields continued to climb on Tuesday, with the 10-year yield reaching 4.43%, as investors reacted to ongoing trade tensions and concerns over inflation. The bond market’s volatility has raised questions about the long-term stability of U.S. financial assets.\nBoth the Dow and the S&P 500 added about 0.8% on Monday, while the Nasdaq climbed about 0.6%. All three indexes briefly slipped into the red before rebounding, buoyed by tech stocks after the Trump administration issued a surprise tariff exemption. Apple (AAPL) stock gained more than 2% on Monday, while Palantir Technologies (PLTR) surged almost 5% following news that NATO had finalized its Maven Smart System purchase.\nAuto stocks also rallied Monday after President Donald Trump suggested his administration may offer tariff relief for automakers moving parts production. General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) each rose more than 3%, though no specifics were provided.\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nBank stocks were on track for their largest increase in a week after Citi and Bank of America each reported first-quarter earnings that topped analysts’ expectations.

The costs will be felt primarily within the company's medical technology unit, which makes a range of medical devices and surgical products.

This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the first quarter of 2025, and our updated financial outlook.A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding among other things the company's future operating and financial performance, market position, and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on the current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.A description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2024 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.Moving to today's agenda. Joaquin Duato, our Chairman and CEO, will open with a few comments on our performance and key catalysts for the company. John Reed, our Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine, R&D, will highlight recent data from select assets.I will then review the first quarter sales and P&L results. Joe Wolk, our CFO, will then close by sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and guidance for 2025. Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine; and Tim Schmid, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, MedTech, will be joining us for Q&A.To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last slightly over 60 minutes. With that, I will now turn the call over to Joaquin.\nJoaquin Duato\nThank you, Jess and hello everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered strong operational sales growth of 4.2% across our business. Our Q1 performance reinforces my confidence in our 2025 guidance and reflects the strength of Johnson & Johnson's uniquely diversified business, with year-over-year sales increases in both our Innovative Medicine and MedTech sectors.No other healthcare company has delivered growth through the first year of losing exclusivity for a multi-billion dollar product, in our case, STELARA, and yet that is exactly what we are doing. Our resiliency is a testament to what makes us unique. We are not just a pharmaceutical company or a MedTech company, we are a healthcare company, innovating across the full spectrum of disease.Our consistent strong performance is a testament to our capabilities across commercial, R&D, and supply chain. It is also a reflection of our strength in execution, which you can see in our quarterly results. We have described 2025 as a catalyst year. It is a year that will set us up for accelerated growth through the second half of the decade and beyond.In Q1, the power of our portfolio and pipeline was on full display. In Innovative Medicine, we delivered 4.2% operational sales growth despite an approximate 810 basis points headwind from STELARA, with 11 key brands growing double digits.With our third consecutive quarter of sales above $3 billion, DARZALEX continues to set the standard in multiple myeloma with another quarter of over 20% growth. In fact, just last week, we expanded our DARZALEX indication in Europe with the approval of DARZALEX based quadruplet regimen for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, regardless of transplant eligibility.It is further proof of the impact of this medicine, which together with CARVYKTI, TALVEY and TECVAYLI is changing the conversation from treating to progression to treating to cure. Other significant oncology portfolio advancements in Q1 included Phase 3 data presented at ELCC last month, showing RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE extended overall survival by more than one year versus the current standard of care in first-line EGFR mutated lung cancer.Our last week, the European Commission approved subcutaneous RYBREVANT in combination with LAZCLUZE for the treatment of EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer. This was an important milestone for patients as subcutaneous RYBREVANT reduces administration time from hours to minutes.Our aspiration is for RYBREVANT to LAZCLUZE to become the new standard of care for these patients, and you can see our progress in Q1. In immunology, we are seeing the impact of TREMFYA's entry into inflammatory bowel disease, with our launch in ulcerative colitis, helping accelerate operational sales growth to 20%. And with our recent FDA approval in colon disease, I'm more confident than ever that this blockbuster drug will become the gold standard for IBD patients and a $10 billion plus product.Turning to MedTech. In Q1, we delivered 4.1% operational sales growth with strong performance in our recently acquired cardiovascular businesses Abiomed and Shomed as well as in surgical vision and wound closure.In addition to their contribution to MedTech growth, Abiomed and Shomed continue to meet deal model expectations and both announced important portfolio milestones this quarter. These included updates to the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines for our Impella heart pump, which based on evidence from the DanGer Shock trial was upgraded from Class 2b to Class 2a.And in Shomed, the team launched the first of its kind, Javelin Peripheral IVL catheter for the treatment of difficult to cross lesions in peripheral artery disease. In electrophysiology, we resumed US VARIPULSE cases. And to date, we have completed more than 5,500 cases globally.Turning to surgery. We recently announced we have started OTTAVA clinical trials with a procedure that supports submission for US FDA de novo in general surgery with an indication for multiple upper abdomen procedures.This is an important milestone as we continue to strengthen our presence in robotic surgery. Beyond our existing portfolio and pipeline, we also fortified our leadership as an innovation powerhouse with two major announcements.In March, we announced our commitment to invest more than $55 billion in the US over the next four years in manufacturing, R&D, and technology. This represents a 25% increase in investment compared to the previous four years.It builds upon the company's already elevated commitment to the US economy while expanding our capacity to manufacture next generation medicine and devices for patients in America and around the world.The investment includes four planned new manufacturing facilities, the first of which broke ground last month in North Carolina. And at the beginning of April, we announced the completion of our acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies, which extends Johnson & Johnson's industry leading portfolio in central nervous system disorders.With the addition of CAPLYTA, we have expanded our lineup of therapies with at least $5 billion plus potential in peak year sales, further solidifying sales growth above analyst expectations now through the rest of the decade.Turning to the Talc bankruptcy ruling. As we shared a few weeks ago, we will return to the tort system where we expect continual success in litigating these meritless claims. In terms of next steps, we will immediately pursue our merchant spending in the [multi-dislitigation] to exclude plaintiffs experts known as the downward challenge.And finally, as announced this morning, we increased our dividend for the 63rd consecutive year, which we know is important to our shareholders. We had a strong start to 2025, and I'm looking forward to sharing many more successes throughout the year.Recognizing that there have been many important milestones and data readouts in the quarter, I will now pass the call to John Reed for an Innovative Medicine R&D update.\nJohn Reed\nThank you, Joaquin. I'm excited to share a few highlights from our industry leading Innovative Medicine pipeline that occurred throughout the quarter. With the successful acquisition of Intra-Cellular, I want to focus on CAPLYTA, a remarkable medicine with balanced pharmacology that delivers robust efficacy, combined with a favorable tolerability profile for neuropsychiatric disorders.CAPLYTA is already approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and is the only medicine approved for the treatment of depression in both bipolar 1 and 2 as either monotherapy or adjunctive therapy.On this slide, we're sharing data for major depressive disorder, showing very impressive and consistent improvements in the standard depression scoring metric MADRS in both Phase 3 studies that served as the basis for submission of the supplemental new drug application to the FDA. We anticipate approval of CAPLYTA later this year as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder, representing the largest of the indications for novel antidepressant drugs today.Turning to oncology. We are so excited about our recent overall survival data for RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE in first-line non-small cell lung cancer, harboring EGF receptor gene mutations. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most prevalent type of lung cancer, making up about 85% of lung cancer diagnosis.Sadly, less than 20% of people diagnosed with this form of the disease are alive after five years and only a fraction live long enough to try a second treatment. That's why it is so important to use the best treatment first.In a head-to-head study against today's standard of care, our RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE regimen improved overall survival by more than a year with the Kaplan-Meier survival curves continuing to separate at 37.8 months median follow-up.With RYBREVANT's triple mechanism of action, we're looking to reset the standard five year survival expectations in a never before same way. In simplest terms, we are giving patients more hope that they may live to celebrate another birthday, anniversary, or other important family event, a truly practice-changing achievement.Now moving on to immunology. I draw your attention to the recent FDA approval of TREMFYA in Crohn's disease, our fourth indication for TREMFYA. TREMFYA is currently the only IL-23 inhibitor, with the flexibility of subcutaneous administration for both induction and maintenance dosing for the treatment of Crohn's disease, which means patients can start their treatment by self-administering with results as rapid and robust as receiving the IV in a clinic or doctor's office.Additionally, in a recent head-to-head study in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, TREMFYA demonstrated superiority versus STELARA in all pooled endoscopic endpoints. As the only dual-acting IL-23 inhibitor, TREMFYA neutralizes IL-23, while also binding to CD64 and immune cells that produce IL-23, thus localizing TREMFYA right at the source of inflammation. TREMFYA continues to offer an exceptional solution for patients struggling with inflammatory bowel disease.Lastly, highlighting some of our latest data for our investigational oral IL-23 pathway inhibitor, icotrokinra, we are aiming to redefine the standard of care for people living with plaque psoriasis. Icotrokinra is the first and only targeted oral peptide that selectively blocks the IL-23 receptor.In two placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies, icotrokinra demonstrated impressive complete skin clearance and a favorable safety profile in a once daily pill. Our Phase 3 data demonstrated that nearly half of adult patients and three quarters of adolescents with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis treated with icotrokinra achieved completely clear skin by week 24.We also reported that icotrokinra achieved the prespecified endpoints in additional Phase 3 psoriasis studies, comparing our molecule head-to-head with the most commonly prescribed TYK2 inhibitor. Those data will be shared in an upcoming medical Congress.Looking forward, we are initiating the first ever head-to-head study seeking to demonstrate the superiority of a pill, icotrokinra, compared to an injectable biologic, STELARA, in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, representing an important step forward in psoriasis research. As a reminder, we intend to file icotrokinra for approval later this year.Finally, beyond psoriasis, we recently announced positive top line results from ANTHEM-UC, our Phase 2b study of icotrokinra in adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. That study showed that icotrokinra achieved impressive clinical remission rates, combined with a favorable safety profile, again, dosed as a once-daily pill.With all this progress, you can understand why we continue to be excited about the potential of icotrokinra to transform the treatment paradigm for patients battling with autoimmune diseases. Overall, across all our therapeutic areas, we are absolutely thrilled with the progress that our pipeline has made in the first quarter of this year, and we are eager to report on other significant milestones scheduled for the remainder of 2025.And now I will turn the call over to Jess.\nJessica Moore\nThank you, John. Moving to our financial results. Unless otherwise stated, the percentages quoted represent operational results, and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Starting with Q1 2025 sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.9 billion for the quarter.Sales increased 4.2% despite an approximate 470 basis point headwind from STELARA. Growth in the US was 5.9% and 2.1% outside of the US. Worldwide growth was positively impacted by 90 basis points due to acquisitions and divestitures.Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $11 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $4.54, versus diluted earnings per share of $1.34 a year ago, primarily driven by the reversal of $7 billion related to the Talc settlement proposal.Excluding after tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.7 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.77, representing increases of 1.9% and 2.2%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2024.We are proud to deliver bottom line growth despite the loss of exclusivity of STELARA and the impact of Part D redesign. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide sales of $13.9 billion increased 4.2%, despite an approximate 810 basis point headwind from STELARA. Growth in the US was 6.3% and 1.5% outside of the US.Starting with oncology. DARZALEX growth was 22.5%, primarily driven by continued share gains of approximately 3 points across all lines of therapy and approximately 5 points in the frontline setting as well as market growth.CARVYKTI achieved sales of $369 million and growth of over 100%, driven by share gains and capacity expansion. This reflects sequential growth of 10.5% as we continue to expand outside of the US. TECVAYLI and TALVEY growth was 15% and 50.2%, respectively, reflecting strong launches in the relapsed refractory setting.Patient demand remained strong despite continued adoption of longer dosing intervals. ERLEADA continued to deliver strong growth of 14.6% despite the impact of Part D redesign, primarily driven by share gains and market growth. RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE continued its strong launch trajectory with sales of $141 million and growth over 100%.Within immunology, TREMFYA delivered growth of 20.1% despite the impact of Part D redesign, driven by share gains and market growth across all indications, including our newly launched indication in ulcerative colitis.STELARA declined 32.3% driven by the impact of biosimilar competition and Part D redesign. As a reminder, REMICADE and SIMPONI distribution rights in Europe were returned in Q4. This positively impacted results in the quarter and is anticipated to continue for the remainder of the year. REMICADE sales also include a one-time patient mix benefit in the US.In neuroscience, SPRAVATO growth of 42.9% was driven by increased physician and patient demand. Finally, other assets that were impacted by Part D redesign include INVEGA long-acting injectables, which declined 13.5%. Pulmonary hypertension, which declined 1.2% and was partially offset by market growth and share gains. And XARELTO, which increased by 33% and also included a one-time patient mix benefit.I'll now turn your attention to Medtech. Worldwide sales of $8 billion increased 4.1%, with growth of 5.1% in the US and 3% outside of the US. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 280 basis points on worldwide growth, 420 basis points in the US and 120 basis points outside of the US.Underlying Medtech performance was driven by commercial execution and strength of new products, partially offset by several one-time events, disproportionately impacting orthopedics, in addition to continued competitive PFA pressures in electrophysiology and headwinds in China. Results were negatively impacted by approximately 210 basis points worldwide, 240 in the US and 180 outside of the US due to these one-time events.In cardiovascular, electrophysiology growth was roughly flat versus prior year, driven by lapping of prior year inventory dynamics in Asia, impacting worldwide results by roughly 310 basis points and competitive PFA ablation catheter pressure.This was mostly offset by global procedure growth, new product uptake, and commercial execution. Abiomed delivered growth of 14%, driven by strong growth in all regions and continued adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella CP technology.Cardiovascular results also included $258 million associated with the acquisition of Shockwave. As a reminder, we will lap the acquisition benefit at the end of May. Envision, contact lenses and other grew 2.7%, driven by continued strategic price actions and strong performance in the ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products.Surgical vision growth of 6.2% was driven by our recent innovations, TECNIS Odyssey, PureSee, and Eyhance, as well as commercial execution, partially offset by competitive pressures in the US. Surgery grew 1.1%, with divestitures negatively impacting results by approximately 180 basis points.Performance was driven primarily by commercial execution and the continued strength and adoption of new products across wound closure and biosurgery. Growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in energy and endocutters as well as the negative impact of China VBP.Given the disproportionate impact of the one-time events to orthopedics, I'd like to draw your attention to this additional slide. Orthopedics declined 3.1%, primarily driven by the lapping of a one-time revenue recognition timing change related to certain products across all platforms in the US, fewer selling days and revenue disruption from the previously announced orthopedics transformation.These one-time events negatively impacted worldwide orthopedics growth by approximately 480 basis points, 650 basis points in the US and 210 basis points outside of the US. This was partially offset by success of new product launches and commercial execution.Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2025. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 320 basis points, driven by unfavorable transactional currency and product mix, primarily due to the decline of STELARA in Innovative Medicine as well as the fair value step-up and amortization associated with the Shockwave acquisition in MedTech.Selling, marketing and administrative expenses improved 130 basis points, driven by operating spend management and phasing of investments, primarily in Innovative Medicine. Research and development expenses leveraged by 190 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio progression towards commercialization and phasing of investments in Innovative Medicine, partially offset by investments associated with the recent acquisitions of Shockwave and V-Wave in MedTech.Interest income and expense was a net income of $128 million as compared to $209 million in the first quarter of 2024, primarily driven by higher interest rates paid on higher average debt balances. Other income and expense was a net income of $7.3 billion compared to an expense of $2.4 billion in the prior year, driven by the $7 billion Talc reserve reversal in the first quarter of 2025 and the $2.7 billion Talc settlement proposal recorded during the first quarter of 2024.Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 19.3% versus 12.4% in the same period last year, primarily driven by the tax effect of the reversal of the Talc settlement accrual. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.3% versus 16.5% in the same period last year.I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided the company's income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items.Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment for the quarter. New this quarter and to continue our efforts of increased financial transparency, you will find GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations by segment in the supplemental schedules of our press release.Innovative Medicine margin declined from 42.9% to 42.5%, primarily driven by unfavorable transactional currency and product mix and cost of products sold and Part D redesign, partially offset by operating leverage.MedTech margin declined from 26.4% to 25.9%, primarily driven by R&D and selling, marketing and administrative investments associated with the recent acquisition of Shockwave and V-Wave. As a result, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 36.8% to 36.6%. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call, and I will now turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Wolk\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Thanks, Jessica. Not just for the transition now but also for how well you have led the Investor Relations function in the past few years. The investment community will miss you, but we look forward to seeing you in the lead finance role for Innovative Medicine. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strength and reliability of Johnson & Johnson's diversified business model.Innovative Medicine achieved robust growth in the face of STELARA biosimilar entrants and we advanced our pipeline, attaining significant clinical and regulatory milestones. In MedTech, as indicated in January, we anticipate pockets of challenge early on and are planning for higher second half growth in those areas of our business.The team is focused on commercial execution and accelerating the recently launched products to deliver MedTech's commitments that are included in the company's full year guidance. The recent acquisitions of Abiomed and Shockwave continue to expand our presence in higher growth markets.In addition, we continue to take steps to improve MedTech's future margin profile, implementing a restructuring program designed to simplify and focus the operations of our surgery business, similar to what we launched in orthopedics in 2023.Focusing on portfolio renewal, we plan to exit certain non-strategic product lines globally and optimize select sites across the network. We anticipate some modest short term revenue disruption in surgery of approximately $250 million in total over the next two years, but these actions will improve our ability to accelerate growth and enhance profitability. The program is expected to be completed in 2027, with cost estimated at approximately $900 million.Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We are pleased with free cash flow generation in the quarter of approximately $3.4 billion. We ended the first quarter with $38.8 billion of cash in marketable securities and $52.3 billion of debt for a net debt position of $13.5 billion.It is important to note that cash and net debt were favorably impacted by approximately $14 billion of cash held in anticipation of the Intra-Cellular acquisition, which closed on April 2. Taking this into consideration, net debt would have been approximately $27.5 billion.Investment in innovation remains the highest priority in our capital deployment. And during the first quarter, we invested more than $3 billion in research and development, approximately 15% of sales. We also remain committed to returning capital directly to shareholders.We recognize the value investors place on our dividend, and we were pleased to announce today that our Board of Directors authorized a 4.8% increase, marking our 63rd consecutive year of dividend increases. The Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition bolsters our neuroscience portfolio and we maintain a disciplined approach to inorganic growth, focusing on acquisitions and partnerships that align strategically and offer value creation.As noted in our Talc investor call and following up on some of Joaquin's earlier comments, we reversed $7 billion of the reserve previously held for the bankruptcy plan. This litigation has not, and we foresee will not impact our ability to execute upon our capital allocation priorities to appropriately manage our business.Let's now discuss our full year guidance for 2025. We are increasing our operational sales guidance for the full year by $700 million to reflect the addition of CAPLYTA following the completion of the Intra-Cellular acquisition. Therefore, we now expect operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 3.3% to 4.3%, with a midpoint of $92 billion or 3.8%.Excluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, we are maintaining our adjusted operational sales growth to the range of 2% to 3% compared to 2024. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. And last quarter, we utilized the euro spot rate relative to the US dollar of $1.04. Last week, the euro spot rate relative to the US dollar was $1.11.We estimate an incremental positive foreign currency impact of $1.1 billion versus previous guidance, resulting in a full year headwind of $600 million. As such, we now expect reported sales growth between 2.6% to 3.6%, with a midpoint of $91.4 billion or 3.1%.Turning to other notable items on the P&L. We are maintaining our guide of operating margin improvement by 300 basis points versus 2024. This improvement takes into consideration the dilution from the Intra-Cellular transaction as well as what we know today about the impact of tariffs on our business.We now project net interest expense between $100 million and $200 million, primarily driven by financing costs associated with the Intra-Cellular acquisition. Other income is anticipated to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, a slight increase versus previous guidance.Despite $0.25 dilution from the Intra-Cellular acquisition and including the impact of tariffs based on what is in place today, we are pleased to be able to maintain our adjusted reported earnings per share guidance of 6.2% at the midpoint for a range of $10.50 to $10.70, partially aided by the reduced FX impact.I'll now provide some qualitative considerations on phasing for your models. We continue to expect both Innovative Medicine and MedTech operational sales growth to be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half.Regarding Innovative Medicine, we maintain the assumption that the impact of STELARA biosimilar competition will accelerate throughout the year, similar to HUMIRA's erosion curve, which is still our proxy with the additive impact of Part D redesign.The impact of Part D redesign on affected products as a percent of sales will be consistently applied throughout the year, aligned with how we traditionally account for similar discount and rebate programs. Naturally, we expect a greater benefit from our newly launched products as the year progresses.Regarding MedTech, we expect normalized procedure volume and seasonality. And of course, we anniversary the Shockwave acquisition at the end of May. We anticipate our newly launched products to build throughout the year with the relaunch of VARIPULSE in the US, the introductions of dual energy STSF in the EU, Dellas Unity, VELYS Spine and TECHNIS Odyssey.Lastly, this slide highlights the one-time prior year P&L items that should be taken into quarterly consideration for your models. Beyond our financial commitments and what Joaquin and John mentioned, we are excited for the pipeline progress planned for the remainder of 2025.In Innovative Medicine, this includes expected approvals in nipocalimab for generalized myasthenia gravis, subcutaneous RYBREVANT for non-small cell lung cancer in the US, TREMFYA subcutaneous induction for ulcerative colitis, and CAPLYTA for adjunctive major depressive disorder.We continue our rolling submission of TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and anticipate filing icotrokinra in psoriasis, and planned data readouts for RYBREVANT in head and neck cancer and icotrokinra in ulcerative colitis as well as head to head data versus the TYK2 in psoriasis.In MedTech, we continue to make progress with clinical trials for our OTTAVA robotic surgical system and across our cardiovascular portfolio, including heart recovery with Impella ECP submission and circulatory restoration with Javelin and Shockwave E8 launches.This progress will bode well for financial performance for the balance of this decade. In fact, building on John's earlier discussion on our Innovative Medicine pipeline and what I just outlined I'd like to revisit and update a slide that we shared at our enterprise business review in late 2023.In that slide, you may recall we highlighted key assets in our portfolio that we expected to drive long term growth and projected higher revenue than Street estimates. We've been pleased to see that some estimates have been raised since the 2023 enterprise business review. And now I'd like to walk you through some of our current thinking on our pipeline potential to show where we see even more upside.Based on current 2027 Street estimates, our projections are at least 2 times higher for RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE, and at least 50% higher for SPRAVATO. One asset that we didn't highlight in this look back in 2023 was TREMFYA.However, given recent regulatory approvals for inflammatory bowel disease, we now see sales for TREMFYA at least 25% higher than current Street estimates. When looking ahead to 2028, we anticipate sales for our intravascular drug releasing system previously referred to as [TARIS] to be at least 3 times higher than current Street estimates, and new to the chart, icotrokinra, our targeted oral peptide to be at least 2 times higher.To be balanced, analyst estimates are still a bit more optimistic than our own estimates on nipocalimab in 2027. However, we do anticipate closing that gap after launch. We have even stronger conviction today in our growth opportunities than at the enterprise business review as we've reached new milestones with each of these medicines.And importantly, we expect all of these assets to achieve peak year sales beyond 2028 with further potential upside to Street estimates in the outer years. Even after considering risk adjustments for unapproved products that you may apply, hopefully, you'll also conclude there is additional value to your outlooks.In summary, it was a solid start to the year. Johnson & Johnson's diversified business model uniquely positions us to tackle the headwinds in 2025, deliver on our financial commitments, and advance our pipeline to create long term sustainable value for shareholders.Thank you. And with that, we are happy to take your questions. Kevin, will you please provide instructions for those seeking to participate in the Q&A.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a nice quarter. Joe, you talked about $400 million in tariffs in the 2025 guidance or about $0.14 by our math. What is that on an annualized basis? And how are you thinking about being able to mitigate that over time? Can you pass along pass it along to customers? Or can you offset it by moving production? Thanks for taking the question.\nJoseph Wolk\nYeah, thanks, Larry. Good to hear from you. So what's included in the $400 million, and again, that is primarily MedTech tariffs at this point. It's based on the programs that have been announced and the timing that correlates those programs.So that would be inclusive of Mexico and Canadian import tariffs that are not excluded out of USMCA. It will include to a very small degree, some of the steel and aluminum tariffs that impact some more products. It includes the China tariffs as well as the China retaliatory tariff. And that is probably the most substantial out of all the tariffs in terms of that $400 million.And so just maybe clarify for everybody that, that is products of US origin being shipped into China, and that's probably the most penalizing factor. That $400 million, I don't want to be cavalier about that. It's obviously -- the program has been phased in as a partial year. And then you have mostly this being captured as cost of goods.So it's going to sit on the balance sheet in inventory and be relieved through the P&L in future periods. So that's how we're thinking of it. In terms of mitigation strategies. I think you know across our entire business, we're very limited in terms of price leverage, whether it be on the MedTech side.There's contractual agreements already in place and certainly very much completed on the pharmaceutical side on current products that exist in terms of taking price increase. And I know Joaquin has a few thoughts regarding tariffs and maybe other mitigation factors and the supply nature of healthcare.\nJoaquin Duato\nThank you, Joe, and thank you, Larry, for the question. Thinking about tariffs, I'm thinking specifically about pharmaceutical tariffs, there's a reason Larry why pharmaceutical tariffs are zero. It's because tariffs can create disruptions in the supply chain, leading to shortages.If what you want is to build manufacturing capacity in the US, both in MedTech and in pharmaceuticals, the most effective answer is not tariffs but tax policy. As a matter of fact, since President Trump 2017 tax reform, the investment in manufacturing, both in MedTech and in pharmaceuticals has significantly increased.And when you think about our recent announcement of investing $55 billion over the next four years at the completion of this investment plan, essentially all our advanced medicines that are used in the US will be manufactured in the US. So tax policy is a very effective tool to be able to build manufacturing capacity here in the US, both for MedTech and pharmaceuticals.\nJoseph Wolk\nLarry, I just want to follow up too. You did ask about a full year impact. And I would say like purposely ignored the question only because it would be way too speculative at this point. As we know, these tariffs are very fluid, and the responsible action for us now is to quantify what we see the impact in 2026, and then see what happens with respect to does it lend itself to negotiations with other countries and what's actually in place as we get into the later part of 2025.\nOperator\nChris Schott, JPMorgan Chase & Company.\nChris Schott\nGreat, thanks so much. Just had a question on gross margins in the quarter. It seems like these came in well below recent trends. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of the drivers there. And just the outlook going forward as we consider mix, tariffs, et cetera, on the gross margin line? Thank you.\nJoseph Wolk\nHey Chris, this is Joe. Thanks for the question. So I'd say it's -- there's a two part answer to this one. So specifically in the quarter, when looking at first quarter of 2024, we obviously had the impact of STELARA which was a much higher gross margin product than our average product in our portfolio. You had Part D, which is exclusively priced, which is eroding margin.And then you had some, I would say, transactional currency headwinds, one, a favorable impact last year or in 2023 funneling into 2024, and then some unfavorability from last year's currency action. I would expect moving forward based on some of the plans that we have, you could expect that 300 basis points to probably improve by a third to 50%, and that would be inclusive of the tariffs that I just mentioned in Larry's question.The other thing I would say is, I know you guys do a great job, but I think analysts were maybe a little bit optimistic with respect to their outlook for gross profit. Given that we had STELARA and Part D certainly communicated in the past, I believe the consensus was taking gross margins up year-over-year. And that one was probably a little bit of a miss. So we probably could have done a better job explaining it.\nOperator\nAsad Haider, Goldman Sachs.\nAsad Haider\nThanks for taking the question. Just going back to the STELARA biosimilar version and the acceleration of the trajectory that we're going to see over the course of the year. Are you able to provide any quantitative framing on your views as it relates to the extent to which you think this erosion gets smoothed out by the transition to other brands like TREMFYA and other products? Thank you.\nJennifer Taubert\nWell, good morning. Thanks so much for the question. It's Jennifer. So what we saw with STELARA in the first quarter was definitely in line with our expectations for the product for the year. And we continue to guide to the HUMIRA two year erosion curve once there were multiple biosimilars as really the best model there and make sure you are also including the additional impact of Part D redesign.If I could one additional point around STELARA, if we take a look at the business overall, it was highlighted that we had 4.2% growth across innovative medicine. That included a negative 810 basis point impact from STELARA.If you exclude that from our business, the remaining business, the bulk 90% of our business was actually growing over 12%, really demonstrating the strength of our overall business and with 11 key brands that were growing double digits. So yes, got the STELARA LOE, but the strength of the business is really coming through across all of our growth drivers.\nJoaquin Duato\nYeah, and I would add to that. It is remarkable that in a year in which we are facing the headwind of the STELARA biosimilars, Part D redesign. We are able to grow even in the first quarter. and that we are able to do it like any other company to my knowledge in the healthcare industry has done it. Is a testament to the strength of our business, to the diversification of our growth platforms. And it gives me a strong belief that we are going to continue to deliver throughout the year.\nJohn Reed\nJoaquin and Jeff just building on the focus on STELARA, of course, STELARA begins to sunset TREMFYA continues to rise. You've seen the recent approvals in inflammatory viral disease where TREMFYA now is available as the only IL-23 class medicine for subcu delivery in both induction and maintenance.We have generated additional strong data going head-to-head against STELARA in a rigorous double-blind study, and showing the superiority across all mucosal endpoints. So that's really disease modifying healing. And then finally, I would say you'll see later this year, data in psoriatic arthritis, where we've done a rigorous study looking at preservation of joint avoiding the joint erosion that leads to long term disability.And what you'll see in those data when they're presented as a best in disease profile for TREMFYA in psoriatic arthritis. So really excited about the progress with TREMFYA, the world's first selective IL-23 inhibitor.\nOperator\nDanielle Antalffy, UBS.\nDanielle Antalffy\nHey, good morning everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Thanks so much to for all the color on tariffs and the ortho impact, that was super helpful. And Jeff, we're really going to miss you. But congrats and good luck in your next role. Just a quick question on -- and maybe this isn't really a question, I don't know, but I think it's still on the table and that do we or don't we go into a recession?And I'd love some color as much as you can provide on how you guys think about your business and how recession proof it is reason and what areas might be most at risk of underperforming relative to where we are today in a recession? Thanks so much.\nJoseph Wolk\nHey Danielle, good to hear from you. Yeah, it's a good question. I think when we think about our business, the one thing we look to is certainly jobs reports in the US. And as of the most recent reports, it seemed to be pretty healthy. The reason we look at that is because it's a precursor as to who may have benefits and coverage prescription medications as well as procedures inclusive of elective procedures.We have seen in times past when there's been a little bit of a recession at some of those elective procedures maybe get delayed, but they don't get abandoned, and I'm thinking primarily within orthopedics. Healthcare overall has proven to be, while nothing is immune to a recession, it's been a little bit more recession proof than most other industries.And so we'll continue to monitor that. But right now, we feel good about the standards of care that we're elevating on both the innovative medicine and MedTech side of the house.\nJoaquin Duato\nOverall health care demand remains solid, and we feel good about the rest of the year regarding procedures and use of pharmaceuticals. I don't know any comments on that. Tim?\nTim Schmid\nSure. Further to Joe's point, Daniel, the category such as advanced IOLs is a good precursor to assessing the health of the economy. And so far, we haven't seen any impact on the performance of our IOL portfolio. In fact, we've seen the opposite.When you look at the performance of our IOL business on the back of the launch of both TECHNIS Odyssey here in the US and PureSee globally, we're seeing benchmark performances, and frankly, a turnaround of our performance here in the US with truly differentiated innovation. And so far, no major headwinds.\nOperator\nTerence Flynn, Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn\nHi, good morning. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the question. Joe, we heard your comments this morning on the Section 232 potential pharma tariffs being focused more towards generics API versus the complex branded biologics. So just wondering if that's based on your impression of the most likely outcome here or that's more just your speculation or hope for the outcome. Thank you.\nJoaquin Duato\nLet me take that question, Terence, myself. So we are analyzing the Section 232. It was already announced previously. So it's something that we consider normal that is going to happen. And overall, adding to my comments on tariffs before, I think it's also important that companies in healthcare partner with the administration to look to mitigate some of the vulnerabilities that exist today in our healthcare supply chain so as to avoid any continuity of supply effect.So it's important for us to partner with the administration and with the government, and we plan to do it in this process to make sure that we have enough manufacturing capacity here in the US to be able to address multiple scenarios.\nJoseph Wolk\nAnd Terence, just to be clear, though, we want to be differential to the administration and their process, that is speculative just looking at the pharmaceutical landscape and where national security interest may reside and what products that those are delivered from. So that was really kind of our take on it, but we are working and engaging with the administration and being differential to their process.\nOperator\nJoanne Wuensch, Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch\nGood morning, and thank you for taking the question and providing all of this information, very helpful. I do want to sort of just pause for a second on the orthopedic sales and try to unpack how much of that is which variable is there a way to quantify it? And how do we think about the recovery in the back half of the year and then into next year. Thank you.\nTim Schmid\nJoanne, thank you for the question. And as we mentioned, we've tried to provide as much as possible to the significant impact of one timers in the quarter, which, to your point, have disproportionately impacted the Ortho business to the tune (inaudible) 480 basis points.There are three key drivers to that. Number one, the lapping of prior year change in walking implants revenue recognition, fewer selling days, and finally, revenue disruption from the recent ortho transformation, which we announced in 2023.So when you actually look at our operational growth when accounting for those, it would be closer to 2%. Now at the same time, I will say, Joanne, we're not satisfied. Our underlying performance was impacted by competitive pressures primarily in spine and sports, which is partially offset by strong NPIs and commercial execution in categories like trauma, shoulder and foot and ankle.What gives us confidence in continued acceleration to the back half of the year is the incredible impact of truly differentiated innovation across ortho portfolio. In fact, in 2024, we had 18 510(k) approvals here in the US and 45 outside of the US across our portfolio.And what gives us confidence is this combination of having best-in-class implants with truly differentiated enabled technology such as VELYS. In our hips portfolio, we believe we're going to see continued performance on the back of our focus on anterior approach, both with ACTIS, VELYS, KINCISE 2.0.In knees, we have seen a slowdown in revisions where I think you know we are historically number one, but feel very confident about continued momentum in primary with the combination of ATTUNE and VELYS, which is now available in 30 markets. We have 110,000 procedures.And as you probably know, we're now launching the VELYS (inaudible) in the coming quarters. In trauma, this was a standout quarter for us, close to 7.3% operational growth when you account for the one-timers, and this was driven by a tremendous uptake of our VOLT Plating System and the feedback we've got from surgeons, especially for our small frag menu frag, our distal radius has been exceptional. I think you also know that spine has been a bit of a laggard for us in the ortho portfolio.We are now effectively launching the trial to spine system, which is a thoracolumbar system, coupled with VELYS Spine also launching in the coming quarters. And so not the best start but strong confidence in improved performance for the remainder of the year in ortho.\nOperator\nVamil Divan, Guggenheim Partners.\nVamil Divan\nGreat, thanks for taking the questions and for all the information. So I just wanted to maybe focus on that slide 29, Joe, that you touched about on this for you, Joe, or for Jennifer. I appreciate you sharing your perspectives on those products and how they differ your expectations are for consensus.There's three products that are not on there anymore that were there at the end of 2023, and that's CARVYKTI, TALVEY, and TECVAYLI. And I don't think the consensus expectations have changed for those very much since then.So maybe you can just talk about what has changed there why those aren't listed? Has there anything changed from your internal perspective or again externally that just had those come off of that list. Thank you.\nJessica Moore\nHi Vamil, this is Jess. Yes, you're absolutely correct. The multiple myeloma portfolio was on the slide during the EBR in 2023, and they are not on the slide today. Not saying that there is not still a disconnect, but it's just not to the extent of the other products on the list. At that time, we had estimated if you did the math on the slide, it would have been about $4 billion that would have been added to 2027.Around $2 billion was added. So those estimates did go up at that time. Again, not that there's not still a disconnect. It's just not to the extent of the others on the slide because those estimates were increased.\nJoseph Wolk\nSo just to be super clear on that one, Vamil, we are still extremely bullish based on the clinical progression, R&D as well as the performance that we're seeing in the marketplace. I mean, look at CARVYKTI, I think, doubled sales year-on-year. So it's just a matter of that you guys took your numbers up. And so we agree, I guess, is maybe the best way to say that.\nJennifer Taubert\nMaybe just to add in a little bit more on CARVYKTI. So yeah, over 100% operational growth in the first quarter, and we continue to make very strong share gains in that second line plus indication, we continue to add sites. We continue to add countries and capacity expansion globally.And so we have very firm conviction in CARVYKTI as a $5 billion plus asset and really are rolling that out globally very effectively at this point in time. So we don't see capacity as a constraint going forward based on the strength of the efforts that have taken place. And so we're full speed ahead for CARVYKTI going forward.\nJohn Reed\nAnd with the TEC and TAL, John here, we're really just getting started. You've probably seen some of the recent data where we've even combined those two molecules to achieve really unprecedented levels of complete responses.At the hematology meetings last year, we also showed combining either TEC or TAL with DARZALEX and demonstrating really impressive 100% minimal residual disease negativity in earlier lines of therapy and the opportunity, therefore, to really start bringing these first-in-class bispecific T cell redirecting molecules into earlier lines, even frontline in combination with our DARZALEX. So really enormous opportunity lies ahead of us with TEC and TAL.\nJennifer Taubert\nAnd a couple of other things on TEC and TAL. So we continue to expand. We've got very good penetration in the academic settings right now, and we continue to expand out into the community. We've got very strong new patient starts. I know that the products have been plagued a little bit because the product is so effective with less frequent dosing.As we move forward, we should be lapping that soon. And really, you'll see the strength of those new patient starts and the continued expansion into the community we're starting to show through, combined then with what John talked about in terms of additional combinations and such, we've got very strong convictions, and we remain convinced on the opportunities for TEC and TAL.\nOperator\nMatt Miksic, Barclays.\nMatt Miksic\nGreat, thanks so much for taking the questions, and I appreciate all the color. I had a clarification and a question if I could. So the question first. Would be great if you could maybe flush out the way that the opportunities in TREMFYA, which is now kind of leaning into (inaudible) and the emerging opportunities for icotrokinra in oral kind of -- and you see them coming together this year, next year, the year after as kind of a portfolio in immuno.And then clarification, if I could, just for Tim, it sounded like when you were describing the ortho impacts, you've got something like 2%. But if you look at the hip and knee math, I'm right, let's think about 2% US, I just want to make sure I understand.It sounded like your view was that's share, that's on else, and we're going to remedy that with the innovations and new products this year. Maybe just put to spine of a point on it, but like that's not market growth, like 2%, like you would say we're below market, and we should be doing better. Or do you think that that's kind of where the market's at is in, that like low single-digit range for US SMEs. Thanks so much. Apology for a long clarification, that will be super helpful. Thanks.\nTim Schmid\nMatt, let me start with your question on ortho. And to be perfectly frank, while we have seen an improvement in our performance both in hips and knees through 2024, Q1 clearly wasn't our strongest quarter. And so we have seen competitive pressures. As you know, these are highly attractive categories within ortho, it's where the primarily fight is. And frankly we need to do better.And so we believe that our performance so far in the quarter was slightly below market. These are attractive markets. We've seen a strong robust procedures across ortho and we expect that to continue, as I mentioned, with the addition of our portfolio of both implants as well as enabling technology across hips and knees, we're confident that we will see an improvement through the remaining quarters. Thank you.\nJennifer Taubert\nRight. So let's switch over to TREMFYA in immunology, and TREMFYA really had a great quarter in the first quarter with sales nearly $1 billion and over 20% operational growth. And this was really driven by market share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis as well as what we're seeing as it relates to the launch in ulcerative colitis and also in Crohn's disease.So we are really encouraged by the launch in both of these IBD indications. TREMFYA is now if we start with ulcerative colitis and how we're doing and then I'll go to Crohn's disease. So an ulcerative colitis TREMFYA is the fastest-growing product in the ulcerative colitis market.IL-23s are the fastest-growing class, and TREMFYA has already achieved nearly a 50% share of the IL-23 new patient starts in UC. So this is really based on the strength of the profile of the product and the strong differentiation that we have as a dual-acting IL-23, both impacting both IL-23 as well as CD64.The robust data that we have as it relates to efficacy and remission. And then as we get in to Crohn's disease and then later in ulcerative colitis as well, what we see is unrivaled simplicity with the opportunity for subcu induction as well as maintenance dosing.And when we take a look at market research data and intent to prescribe, the data comes through really strong that gastroenterologists really prefer TREMFYA over the IL-23 competitors based on those aspects that I just discussed. So efficacy, sustained remission, and mucosal healing right now for UC.On Crohn's, there is very significant enthusiasm around our launch there and it's really quickly getting traction. In the first few weeks since approval in Crohn's disease, patient initiation volumes are outpacing the other IL-23 launches in the market.And the polling (inaudible), our recent market research, 82% of gastroenterologists consider TREMFYA's induction dosing and flexibility to be a very positive differentiation in their treatment decisions, and they're seeing the efficacy profile to be quite compelling compared to the other therapies that are in the market. So we believe that in IBD, both in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's, we're off to a strong start.And as a reminder, tracking back to STELARA, STELARA 75% of sales were in IBD indications. We see no reason why TREMFYA wouldn't be the same or even better based on what we're seeing with the strength and competitiveness of the profile.\nJohn Reed\nMaybe just a comment on icotrokinra since you asked about that. The most proximal opportunity there is our psoriasis campaign where we will have altogether five Phase 3 studies, data for that this year, we expect to submit this year for psoriasis.We're so excited to be able to offer patients more choice with even a market like psoriasis, which should be well penetrated by now because it is a place where some of the biologics first got their start. More than half of patients who are eligible for an advanced therapy are still not on advanced therapy.And for many of these patients, it's really an aversion to the injections and going the biologics route. So to be able to offer patients a choice of a once-a-day pill to provide a solution for their disease, which has efficacy in the same ballpark as the biologics and with that well proven safety profile of IL-23 class is really exciting for us.\nJennifer Taubert\nYeah, we really believe that icotrokinra is a big market expansion opportunity to get in those earlier lines of therapy and to bring patients into therapies that have that strong biologic like efficacy. We think that there is a lot of room for both icotrokinra and TREMFYA in the market, and based on different patient needs, different physician needs as well. And so we think both of these are very important growth drivers for us going forward.\nJessica Moore\nThank you, Matt. Kevin, we have time for one last question.\nOperator\nTim Anderson, Bank of America.\nTim Anderson\nThank you so much. Going back to tariffs, a big concern by investors is how that might ultimately wrap in transfer pricing structures? And every company I know is usually hesitant to talk about that. I'm wondering what J&J can offer up on that front that could include things like major products where you have transfer price structures in place as well as which geographies you have those in place as well.\nJoseph Wolk\nYeah, I appreciate the question, Tim. It's just not something that for competitive reasons we're going to comment on.\nJoaquin Duato\nI would reiterate what I said before. With our $55 billion investment plan and the completion of that plan, which we spoke about four years, all our advanced medicines that are used in the US will be manufactured here in the US.So that's our plan, and that's why we believe it's important to provide this continuity. As I said before, after 2017 President Trump's tax reform, the level of investments the US have increased, and we plan to continue to increase it given the current tax regime or improvements that may come into the future.\nJessica Moore\nThank you, Tim, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions that you may have.As many of you have seen, Darren Snellgrove will be transitioning into the Investor Relations role starting May 1, as I transition into the Innovative Medicine CFO role. The last 3.5 years have been an absolute pleasure getting to engage with you all. I will now turn the call over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.\nJoaquin Duato\nThank you, Jess, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today.

A: Joseph Wolk, CFO, explained that the $400 million primarily involves MedTech tariffs, including those from Mexico, Canada, and China. The most significant impact comes from US-origin products shipped to China. Mitigation strategies are limited due to existing contractual agreements, but tax policy is seen as a more effective tool than tariffs for building US manufacturing capacity.\nQ: Can you explain the drivers behind the lower gross margins this quarter and the outlook going forward?

The company monitors job reports as an indicator of healthcare coverage and demand.\nQ: Can you provide more details on the orthopedic sales decline and the recovery outlook? A: Tim Schmid, EVP, Worldwide Chairman of MedTech, explained that the decline was due to one-time events like revenue recognition changes and fewer selling days.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes.\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer reacted to the partial tariff exemptions announced by the White House, interpreting them not as a full retreat, but as a strategic pause designed to avoid punishing American companies. He suggested the administration was being careful not to hand over competitive advantages to Southeast Asian rivals, particularly Samsung:\n“So what I saw today, and not to be facetious, but what I see is people saying, you know what, we’ve seen the downside. Maybe we can test it again. But the president has, I don’t want to say blink, because that’s nonsense. What the president did was say, OK, look, we’re not going to continue to punish American companies and give the green light to Korea. I don’t know if you heard Lutnick’s words. He was very specific. Southeast Asia. That’s Samsung. They didn’t want to give the ball to Samsung.”\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Hints at a Bigger Agenda Behind Tariffs and Breaks Down These 7 Stocks and Jim Cramer Reacts to the Surprise Market Surge and Highlights 8 Key Stocks.\nTurning to currency dynamics, Cramer pushed back on what he sees as misplaced panic over a weakening U.S. dollar. Instead, he argued that a softer dollar actually benefits American multinationals and gives long-needed relief to CFOs who’ve spent years blaming currency strength for lost market share:\n“Well, look, I’m not so certain I’m going to do a little contrary stuff on the dollar here. When we listen to conference calls, for the last four years, all we hear about is it would have been so much better if the dollar weren’t so strong. We keep losing share, the dollar’s too strong. Suddenly the dollar’s weaker, and now we start hearing all the downside, what, the bonds? I mean, I’m almost thinking that, I’m gonna put this out there, the people who are saying that it’s the end of the world, that the dollar is weaker, I think they have to go do some work boots on the ground. […] So suddenly the dollar’s weaker and we are petrified? These are people who have an agenda. And their agenda is to say, you know what matters more than anything else? Our hegemony from a strong dollar. And I don’t get it. If you’re in our business of picking stocks, you’re sick and tired of hearing CFOs say, we are done. We’ve got to stop this dollar rise.”\nCramer also gave his opinion about the rhetoric coming from Beijing, likening it to the Cold War-era paranoia of the 1960s and ’70s. He questioned whether a diplomatic breakthrough similar to Nixon’s historic visit to China is even possible under the current tone of U.S.-China relations:\n“But when I listen to the rhetoric from China, this is the 1968-72 rhetoric. It’s the kind of rhetoric that just says there’s never going to be a meeting. Is there a way to have a Nixon to China moment? Because as far as I’m concerned, this is just right now you’re on the verge of when I was a little boy and we kept thinking, when are they going to bomb us? I mean, that was the same rhetoric. When are they going to launch their nuclear weapons? I mean, that’s why we used to live in fear. That’s why we had cubbyholes. That’s why we used to put our heads in a cubbyhole, because the Chinese were going to bomb us if the Russians didn’t bomb us. This is the same sound.”\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on April 14th.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

He specifically referenced Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) as one of the companies that could benefit from a weaker dollar and did not hesitate to point out what he likes about the company. Here is what he said:\n“Because when you hear Johnson & Johnson tomorrow morning, Great American company, AAA balance sheet, always been good. All you ever hear from them, from Joe Wolk, who’s the excellent CFO he is, if it weren’t for the dollar, if it weren’t for the dollar …”\nOverall, JNJ ranks 11th on our list of key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes.

The world's biggest healthcare products maker continued with its long streak of earnings beat and also exceeded revenue estimates. It raised its revenue guidance for this year amid tariff chaos and boosted its quarterly dividends.Given the resilience of the drugmaker amid the potential tariff shifts under the Trump administration, investors should tap the company’s growth prospects through ETFs with the largest allocation to this diversified drug maker. These include iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF IHE, iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF IYH, First Trust Nasdaq Pharmaceuticals ETF FTXH, Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund XLV and VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF PPH.JNJ’s first-quarter earnings per share came in at $2.77, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 and improved 2.2% from the year-ago earnings.

Sales of JNJ’s top-selling blood cancer treatment, Darzalex, jumped 20% to $3.2 billion, while Xarelto generated $690 million in sales, up 33% year over year. However, sales of the blockbuster psoriasis drug Stelara declined 34% to $1.6 billion due to the launch of several biosimilar versions entering the market. Invega Sustenna sales also dropped 15% to $903 million.Johnson & Johnson raised its revenue guidance for fiscal 2025 to $91.0-$91.8 billion from $89.2-$90.0 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 2.6%-3.6% versus the prior expectation of 0.5%-1.5%. The new guidance reflects the addition of Caplyta (lumateperone) following its $14.6 billion acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies. The company maintained its adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of $10.50-$10.70 due to tariff costs, dilution from the Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition, and updated foreign exchange. JNJ revealed tariff costs of roughly $400 million this year.The drugmaker lifted its quarterly dividend to $1.30 per share from $1.24 per share, marking the 63rd year of consecutive increases.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other best dividend monarchs.\nDividend-focused investors are generally well-acquainted with terms like Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Kings, but many may not be aware of a lesser-known group called Dividend Monarchs. While they fall under the broader category of dividend growth stocks, they carry a distinct title. The Dividend Monarchs Index highlights US companies that have managed to raise their dividends consistently for at least 50 consecutive years. These firms have weathered decades of market ups and downs, showcasing both resilience and steady performance in terms of dividend growth and stock returns. As an evolution of the well-known S&P Dividend Aristocrats Index Series, the S&P Dividend Monarchs Index sets an even higher standard, recognizing a more exclusive tier of long-term dividend payers.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices has been a pioneer in dividend growth strategies since the 1980s, initially tracking US companies with at least 10 years of dividend increases. As the number of such companies grew, the threshold was raised to 25 years, forming the basis for the Dividend Aristocrats Index, launched in 2005. This index became a widely recognized benchmark, eventually expanding to include mid- and small-cap stocks as well as global markets. By April 2023, over $40 billion in ETF assets tracked these indices. With a rising number of companies now surpassing 50 consecutive years of dividend growth across different market caps, S&P introduced the Dividend Monarchs Index in 2023 to reflect this new elite group.\nThe key distinction between Dividend Kings and Dividend Monarchs lies in the inclusion criteria. While both require at least 50 consecutive years of dividend increases, Dividend Monarchs must also meet specific standards set by S&P. To qualify for the Dividend Monarchs Index, a company must be part of the Composite 1500, have a float-adjusted market capitalization of at least $2 billion, maintain a three-month average daily trading value of $5 million or more, and consistently grow its dividend over five decades. This added layer of eligibility makes Monarchs a more selective, index-based group.\nCompanies that meet the tough 50-year dividend growth requirement tend to show strong profitability and financial stability. According to an S&P Dow Jones Indices report dated April 30, 2023, the Dividend Monarchs Index outperformed both the broader market and the S&P Composite in terms of return on equity (ROE) and showed more consistent earnings. The report also noted that, based on back-tested data since January 31, 2018, the Dividend Monarchs Index displayed more defensive traits—offering lower volatility and smaller drawdowns than the S&P 500 during market declines.\nAlthough the Dividend Monarchs Index is a relatively new concept with only five years of back-tested performance, it has grown significantly during that time, expanding from 11 to 35 constituents. Despite the index’s short history, the companies included have a track record of at least 50 consecutive years of dividend growth, dating as far back as 1972. According to data presented by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the performance of these companies—measured through both price returns over the past 50 years and total returns since December 1989—has generally outpaced that of the broader market. This suggests that many of the index’s constituents have delivered stronger long-term results. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best Dividend Monarchs to invest in.\nA smiling baby with an array of baby care products in the foreground.\nFor this list, we scanned the holdings of the S&P Dividend Monarchs Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 50 consecutive years of dividend growth. From that list, we picked 10 stocks that were most popular among hedge funds, as per Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the hedge funds having stakes in them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 98\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is an American healthcare company that specializes in manufacturing, developing, and selling a wide range of healthcare products and also offers related services. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company posted a revenue of $22.5 billion, up 5.2% from the previous year and beating estimates by $84.4 million. Operational growth came in at 6.7%, with the MedTech segment seeing a 6.2% increase in global operational sales, helped by both acquisitions and divestitures.\nAlthough Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)’s pharmaceutical segment hasn’t been impacted by current tariffs, its recent effort to resolve talc-related lawsuits through bankruptcy was turned down by a judge. As a result, the company now intends to address the lawsuits through the traditional tort system after courts found the cases don’t cause significant financial strain.\nDespite the unresolved legal issues, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) continues to show strong financial health and steady performance. Both its pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses remain solid, backed by reliable earnings and a productive pipeline that consistently brings new product approvals. With more than a hundred years of innovation under its belt, Johnson & Johnson appears well-positioned to keep moving forward.\nOn April 15, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) declared a 4.8% increase in its quarterly dividend to $1.30 per share. Through this increase, the company stretched its dividend growth streak to 63 years, which makes JNJ a Dividend Monarch to monitor. The stock’s dividend yield on April 15 came in at 3.23%.\nOverall, JNJ ranks 1st on our list of the best Dividend Monarchs to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than JNJ but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

Boston Scientific’s market share in this area is expected to rise over the next year, Needham said.\nThe firm also sees renewed momentum for the company’s WATCHMAN heart implant, which is used to prevent strokes. Doctors increasingly favour using WATCHMAN during other procedures, which could boost near-term sales. Longer term, Needham expects a major clinical trial called CHAMPION-AF to potentially expand the device’s use among more patients, with results due in the first half of 2026.\nRecent acquisitions are also seen as adding to Boston Scientific’s growth story. Bolt Medical’s new device for treating artery disease recently gained U.S. approval, while SoniVie is developing a treatment for high blood pressure.

Electrophysiology was the only cardiovascular group to decline in the quarter, as sales for the segment overall grew by more than 16% to $2.1 billion.\nThe decline, which J&J attributed to competition, contrasts with rivals’ early reports: Medtronic touted strong adoption of its PFA device early in its launch, and Boston Scientific’s electrophysiology sales skyrocketed by 138% last year to nearly $2 billion, posting triple-digit growth as early as the second quarter.\nPFA systems use non-thermal energy to affect heart tissue that causes atrial fibrillation, or an irregular heartbeat. Devices have only been on the market for a short time, but they are already eating up cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation procedures.\nTruist Securities analysts, in a Tuesday note, wrote that J&J missed Wall Street’s sales estimates for electrophysiology by about $50 million, with a miss of about $9 million in the U.S. They added that J&J’s struggles are likely to benefit Boston Scientific and Medtronic given their “sustained head starts in PFA.”\nJ&J received FDA approval for its Varipulse PFA device in November, trailing Boston Scientific and Medtronic to the market by almost one year. The company paused U.S. cases of Varipulse in January for roughly five weeks and worked with the FDA due to safety concerns. At the time of the pause, Wall Street analysts cautioned that it could discourage physicians from using the device, because rival systems had not been connected to patient safety issues.\nIn February, RBC Capital Markets analysts said that physicians’ enthusiasm for Varipulse may have been affected by the company’s decision to stop U.S. cases, writing that J&J would have “to take meaningful steps to educate healthcare professionals.” They wrote that the company should still “be able to drive Varipulse adoption.”\nJ.P. Morgan analysts, in a note after Tuesday’s earnings call, echoed the concerns RBC discussed a few months ago.\nKeep up with the story. Subscribe to the MedTech Dive free daily newsletter\n“While [U.S.] Varipulse cases resumed in the quarter, we continue to expect the [O.U.S. and U.S.] challenges that Varipulse has had to potentially have a lasting negative impact on physician perception of the safety of the catheter,” the analysts wrote, “especially in light of the several safe alternatives now on the market.”\nDespite the early success of Medtronic and Boston Scientific, the J.P. Morgan analysts wrote that J&J’s electrophysiology weakness in the quarter was expected.\nOverall, medtech brought in sales of $8.02 billion, representing a 2.5% increase year over year.\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\nFrom vulnerable medical devices to a breach that took some of Henry Schein’s systems offline, cybersecurity was a key topic for the industry this year.\nMatt Rourke/AP\nThe EPA is expected to finalize new regulations in March that would limit ethylene oxide emissions from companies that sterilize medical devices.\nSubscribe to MedTech Dive for top news, trends & analysis\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\nFrom vulnerable medical devices to a breach that took some of Henry Schein’s systems offline, cybersecurity was a key topic for the industry this year.\nMatt Rourke/AP\nThe EPA is expected to finalize new regulations in March that would limit ethylene oxide emissions from companies that sterilize medical devices.\nThe free newsletter covering the top industry headlines"

(JPM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +0.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which JPMorgan Chase & Co. falls in, has lost 4.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is expected to post earnings of $4.44 per share, indicating a change of +0.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.3% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.06 points to a change of -8.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.31 indicates a change of +6.9% from what JPMorgan Chase & Co. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor JPMorgan Chase & Co. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $42.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -14.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $173.59 billion and $178.19 billion estimates indicate -2.2% and +2.7% changes, respectively.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. reported revenues of $45.31 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.1%. EPS of $5.07 for the same period compares with $4.63 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $43.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.82%. The EPS surprise was +9.74%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about JPMorgan Chase & Co. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in.\nAs we recently discussed in another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’s Berkshire picks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.\nOverall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio. So, let’s take a look at the top Goldman Sachs value stocks.\nA group of business people discussing plans around a boardroom table adorned with a financial services company logo.\nTo compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nGoldman Sachs' Q4 2024 Stake Value: $4,870,962,238\nP/E Ratio as of April 11: 10.98\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 123\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), a New York-based financial services giant, comes in third on our list of the best Goldman Sachs value stocks. Goldman owns 20.3 million JPM shares as of the fourth quarter of 2024, valued at $4.8 billion and representing 0.76% of the total portfolio.\nOn March 12, Truist Securities maintained a Hold rating on JPM with a price target of $268. Truist noted that most of JPMorgan’s customers have good credit and have stayed steady during the ups and downs in the economy. The bank also has solid financials, shown by its consistent dividend policy.\nJPMorgan’s Q1 2025 profit went up 9% to $14.64 billion, or $5.07 a share. Even without a one-time gain from the First Republic deal, earnings stood at $4.91 per share. The company’s revenue rose 8% to $46.01 billion, supported by solid results in asset management, investment banking, and a notable 48% increase in equities trading. On March 18, 2025, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) declared a $1.40 per share quarterly dividend, a 12% jump from the prior dividend of $1.25. The dividend is payable on April 30, to shareholders on record as of April 4.\nAmong the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 123 funds reported owning stakes in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) at the end of Q4 2024, compared to 105 funds in the preceding quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global was the leading stakeholder of the company, with 7.46 million shares worth $1.78 billion.\nOverall, JPM ranks 3rd among the Goldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks. While we acknowledge the potential of value stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

The banking giant continues to benefit from its fortress-like balance sheet and global diversification, making it well-positioned to navigate any economic environment.\nThat was the message from CEO Jamie Dimon presenting the bank's first-quarter earnings report (for the period ended March 31). JPMorgan topped Wall Street estimates, with revenue climbing 8% year over year, while earnings per share (EPS) of $5.07 was up 14% from the prior-year quarter.\nYet the results arrived with a tone of caution. Jamie Dimon also said the U.S. economy faces \"considerable turbulence\" amid the looming impact of trade tariffs being implemented by the Trump administration.\nLet's discuss what tariffs and a trade war might mean for JPMorgan and its stock price outlook now.\nJPMorgan started the fiscal 2025 year off strongly, with all three of its business segments delivering revenue growth.\nThe flagship Commercial & Investment Bank group saw excellent momentum, driven by optimism about the economic outlook at the beginning of the year and record market levels that propelled trading activity and deal-making. In the Consumer & Community Banking division, card services and auto lending have been growth drivers, reflecting resilient consumer spending. Asset & Wealth Management has also been a bright spot as continued net inflows boosted fee income.\nSome of the key financial metrics that stood out in the first quarter include a 2% year-over-year increase in average loans and deposits, while JPMorgan's book value per share rose 12% compared to Q1 2024, reaching $119.24.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nAlthough it may have been business as usual for the bank in the first quarter, the outlook has grown increasingly uncertain. Officially, the bank is guiding for full-year net interest income of $94.5 billion, a 1% increase from last year. However, this number isn't etched in stone, since it depends on the rapidly changing macroeconomic environment. For now, the escalating trade tensions present an operational and financial headwind.\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration announced a major U.S. trade policy overhaul, implementing a 10% baseline tariff on most imports, with significantly steeper tariffs on specific countries like China. Although Trump has since rolled back some steps, pausing higher reciprocal tariffs for 90 days for most countries and allowing for some exceptions, experts warn that the measures may still cause economic disruptions. JPMorgan's chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli now estimates a 50% recession probability, indicating that the bank is taking the risks seriously.\nWhile it's too early to fully assess the effects of the tariffs, the widespread market confusion as companies across all sectors adjust to the new environment has several implications for JPMorgan's outlook.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThere are already indications that mergers and acquisitions have stalled, with dealmakers taking a wait-and-see approach. Companies are likely to reassess hiring plans or push back on major capital investments. For JPMorgan, this means a potential slowdown in its core investment banking business and commercial lending.\nIf a recession does materialize, the consumer banking side of the business would be particularly hard-hit, as loan defaults rise, adding to credit losses. Even with some areas of the bank, such as trading, possibly benefiting from the market volatility across equities and fixed income to offset declines in fees elsewhere, the risk to earnings is tilted to the downside.\nAll this is happening while shares of JPMorgan don't necessarily stand out as a great bargain. Across multiple metrics including the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.6 and price-to-book (P/B) value of 2.0, JPMorgan continues to trade at a premium relative to its average valuation multiples over the past five years. One interpretation is that if conditions deteriorate, the stock has room to fall further.\nJPM PE Ratio data by YCharts.\nAmong bank stocks, few rival JPMorgan's strong fundamentals and disciplined capital management, offering shareholders a source of portfolio stability even in a severe economic downturn. A swift de-escalation of trade tensions through clearer policies or negotiations could catalyze a stock rebound. For now, I'm not convinced shares are a buy, and a cautious wait-and-see approach remains prudent.\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor service has more than quadrupled the performance of the S&P 500 since its inception in 2002*, and the analyst team knows when to double down.

On the morning of the 9th, Trump posted on social media that it was a “great time to buy.” About four hours later, he announced he was suspending tariffs, propelling the S&P 500 index to a 9.5% gain, its biggest rally since 2008.\nGreene’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nGreene, one of the first lawmakers to file a disclosure since Trump announced his tariffs, is an active trader in stocks, filing eight disclosures so far this year. She’s been particularly bullish on the semiconductor and tech industries. Her sale of Treasuries, though, was the first time she’s sold after buying more than $500,000 of the government-backed securities since the beginning of 2025.\nCongressional Democrats have urged investigations into whether people connected to Trump profited from the timing of the tariff announcements.\nIn a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she did not know which officials may have had advance knowledge, but called it “unconscionable” that insiders may have profited from the market volatility.\nThe disclosure reports only require members to list values of transactions in broad ranges, and do not contain specific times of execution or cost basis, so it’s unclear precisely how many of Greene’s trades happened before Trump broke the news of the tariff pause.\nBut at least $11,011 to $165,000 in purchases came on April 8. As of 11:20 a.m. Tuesday in New York, shares of Blackstone, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Tesla traded higher than at any point on that day.\nOver the two days, her stock purchases totaled $21,021 to $315,000. She sold $50,001 to $100,000 of US Treasuries on April 8.\nAmong the other names in Greene’s purchases were chipmakers Nvidia Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., along with apparel companies Lululemon Athletica Inc. and Nike Inc.\n(Updates with Greene’s trading history in fifth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nThe chairman of the Federal Reserve has warned that Donald Trump’s trade war will fuel inflation and keep interest rates higher for longer, triggering a steep sell-off on Wall Street.\nLululemon (LULU) has received quite a bit of attention from Zacks.com users lately. Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.\nSince his inauguration in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has announced - and sometimes reversed - tariffs on a slew of products and countries.  \"Approximately 70% of our aluminum produced in Canada is destined for U.S. customers and is now subject to 25% tariff costs ... Currently the net annual result is approximately $100 million negative for our business,\" CEO William Oplinger said during a post-earnings conference call.  The aluminum producer said the tariffs on Canadian imports had cost the company roughly $20 million in the first quarter, ended March 31.\nThe stock market has been crashing this year and if you're a long-term investor, it can be a good time to invest in companies at discounted valuations.

The market’s third borrower Tuesday, Japanese financial firm Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., priced $3 billion of notes.\nThe longest portion of Wells’ offering, an 11-year security, yields 1.28 percentage point above Treasuries, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified as the details are private. Goldman’s longest portion, a six-year tranche, yields 1.25 percentage point above Treasuries, a separate person said.\nMorgan Stanley, JPMorgan Lead $16.5 Billion Bank Borrowing Spree\nIt’s common for the biggest US banks to sell debt shortly after releasing quarterly results. But there were some questions this go-around after the primary market froze earlier this month in the wake of an evolving global trade war.\nTuesday’s deals received orders 3.3 times the amount of bonds sold, according to Bloomberg’s Brian Smith, compared with 3.8 times on Monday.\n“Clearly there’s appetite for sizable bank issuances,” said Peter Simon, an analyst who covers the sector at research firm CreditSights. “We don’t see much evidence that the market is overly concerned with these banks, which makes sense given their results have been solid this quarter.”\nGoldman reported record revenue in the first quarter, while Wells Fargo’s report pointed to soft loan demand amid the ongoing tariff uncertainty. Wells’ net interest income, the difference between what it makes from lending and pays for deposits, fell short of analysts’ projections. Still, non-interest expenses were better than forecast as Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf works to cut costs.\nIn the high-grade market, banks have underperformed in recent weeks, with TD Securities credit strategist Hans Mikkelsen writing that was likely due to expectations of new debt sales. The average bank bond spread widened 24 basis points this month through Monday, more than investment-grade notes overall while yields for the latter briefly hit 11-month highs last week.\nThat has lured yield buyers into the market, setting things up well to digest the banks’ debt sales, said Samuel Wilson, a portfolio manager at Voya Investment Management.\nBank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. are candidates to issue debt after they released first-quarter results Tuesday.\nComing into earnings season, JPMorgan strategists Kabir Caprihan and Vincent Barretta predicted the six big US banks could might issue about $32 billion of bonds. That compares with an average $23 billion this time each year from 2014 through 2024. The four deals completed so far have raised $28 billion.\n(Updates throughout.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nApple, NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, Amazon.com and Alphabet are included in this Analyst Blog.\n(Reuters) -     U.S. bank PNC Financial  (PNC) reported a rise in first-quarter profit on Tuesday, helped by a boost in interest income.\n(Bloomberg) -- Gold edged toward the record high set on Monday, as the Trump administration pressed ahead with probes that could broaden the US’s sweeping trade war.Most Read from BloombergHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?Trump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office SpaceEven Oslo Has an Air Quality ProblemLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs$15 Million Fund Bets Leadership Training Can Improve Chicago PolicingBullion rose to top $3,230 an ounc\nMerrill Lynch and Bank of America’s Private Bank posted a flat profit for the first quarter of 2025 amid a strong earnings beat for their parent company.

He substantially lowered his price target on the \"Big Four\" U.S. bank last week, yet he remains bullish on its prospects. Here's a detail or several about his new take on the company, and whether his positive outlook is warranted.\nCFRA's Kenneth Leon published an update on JPMorgan Chase following the bank's unveiling of its first-quarter results Friday morning. As in preceding quarters the lender did well, posting solid year-over-year growth on both the top and bottom lines, and topping the consensus analyst estimates for both. \nYet like the rest of the world's businesses, JPMorgan Chase is currently sailing in unfamiliar waters. This was the crux of Leon's price target reduction, according to reports. The analyst wrote that he was narrowing his equity risk premium on the stock due to the currently high level of global uncertainty around U.S. trade policy. \nNevertheless, Leon was very complimentary about the bank's trailing performance. In his view, all of JPMorgan Chase's businesses demonstrated robust health during the quarter, with its commercial and investment bank division especially benefiting from recent market volatility.\nWith all this considered, Leon cut his price target to $260 per share, from his former $310. As that's nearly 12% higher than the company's most recent closing level; but he maintained his buy recommendation.\nIt can be tough to stay bullish on a business so exposed to the whims of the global economy. JPMorgan Chase, though, has a very solid balance sheet and a management team that knows how to earn coin in even the most turbulent times. I think maintaining a bullish stance is the smart move with this stock, and I'd be a buyer at the current discount price.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in JPMorgan Chase, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and JPMorgan Chase wasn’t one of them.

Revenue also rose at all of these banks. Trading revenue alone jumped 17% to more than $36 billion.\nMany banks said their consumer customers were still spending, defaults were still manageable, and businesses were not experiencing distress despite the uncertainty about the months ahead. None of the institutions with big Wall Street footprints updated their earnings outlooks for the rest of the year, either.\nWhat these results didn't include, however, was the volatile period that followed Trump's April 2 \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement, which took place two days after the quarter ended. Stocks and bonds plunged and have yet to fully recover, ushering in new uncertainty about the economy and the safety of US assets.\n\"We're surprised about the degree of ongoing firmwide strength at all 5 big banks ... and the more than expected upbeat views,\" said Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo in a Tuesday note.\n\"To us, it all says that events since Apr 2 can still be little more than a speed bump, so long as policy moves faster to help ease most of the uncertainty,\" he added, in reference to promised deregulation of the banking industry expected from the Trump administration.\nNot that banks and their top executives were entirely upbeat. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said that the prospect of a recession \"has increased.\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the economy faces \"considerable turbulence,\" with a recession as a \"likely outcome.\"\nIn such a scenario, he added, \"earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down.\"\nBut many bankers were noticeably more optimistic. The word \"recession\" did not come up once on Citigroup's Tuesday earnings calls with analysts. Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, also offered an optimistic vision of the current turmoil.\n\"When all is said and done, and longstanding trade imbalances and other structural shifts are behind us, the U.S. will still be the world's leading economy,\" she said in a statement with the bank's Tuesday earnings release.\nBrian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, went out of his way on Tuesday to note that his bank's research team doesn't see a recession happening in 2025.\nRead more: What is a recession, and how does it impact you?\nUS consumers, he added, keep \"pushing money into the economy,\" and the lender's business clients \"remain profitable, liquid and have strong results.\"\nBut \"nobody has a perfect crystal ball,\" Moynihan acknowledged, noting that \"we potentially face a changing economy in the future.\"\nSome banks even showed a rise in investment banking income during the first quarter, defying predictions of a slowdown. Executives acknowledged some deals were now on hold due to uncertainties, but many described the pullbacks as temporary rather than long-lasting.\n\"I'm saying pause versus delete,\" Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick told analysts of the current investment banking environment. \"We don't know whether the economy is going to contract.\"\nEven amid the optimism, there were signs that banks are preparing for harder times. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo (WFC) added $8.4 billion in provisions to account for future loan losses.\nThe figure was 29% higher than the year-ago period and 9% higher than the previous quarter.\n\"We're still in a cloudy period.

Brent crude futures fell 21 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $64.67 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 20 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $61.33.  The International Energy Agency followed on Tuesday with its projection that global oil demand in 2025 will grow at its slowest rate for five years due to worries about economic growth from Trump’s trade tariffs.\nWith President Donald Trump announcing a wide set of tariffs, there could be increased costs for a range of companies.

But an outgrowth of shifting tariff policies has sparked another lucrative exchange on Wall Street: the volatility trade.\nA surge in trading activity has shuttled billions of dollars to the nation’s largest banks as investors have attempted to protect their money or deploy it in the face of market gyrations.\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's \n                        \n                            Terms\n                        \n                     and \n                        \n                            Privacy Policy\n                        \n\nEarnings reports from the big five banks in recent days revealed they collectively raked in nearly $37 billion in trading revenue this past quarter, touting record sales from equities changing hands.\nWarren Buffett famously urged investors to “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” A corollary for the financial institutions facilitating those trades is to sit back in any environment and collect fees.\nWall Street wants stocks to go up, sure, but most importantly, it just wants stocks to move.\nThe big banks' trading may mostly be for hedge funds, pensions, and large companies — big institutional investors. But everyone's rolling up their sleeves at the volatility and tinkering with their portfolios, looking to optimize or take advantage of the moment.\nAs my colleague Josh Schafer reports, everybody's trading. Dip-buying flows following the week of “Liberation Day” reached record levels, according to data from VandaTrack, including $3 billion in net purchases on April 3. That was the largest daily total since VandaTrack began collecting the data in 2014.\nBuying at recent lows and FOMO trading explained much of the heightened activity. But another interpretation is that an entire class of retail investor has been trained to throw their cash into stocks in a continuation of a pandemic-era shift in personal finance.\nYou are probably better off not looking at your diminished 401(k) account when the market is convulsing. But pushing an order on a trading app has become something of a pastime for an increasingly large American demographic, the foundation for group chats among young people, and the basis for an entire genre of aspirational lifestyle content.\nThat big banks' big shot clients are doing this too is a great \"stars, they're just like us\" moment. But it's also part and parcel of the same volatility that's been a hallmark of the 2025 stock market and a lesson in the importance of a diversified portfolio of banks' business lines.\nThat these banks can up their profitability amid economic uncertainty and a lack of an anticipated IPO boom isn’t unique to volatile trading. A similar dynamic was at play earlier this year, when a major market narrative was whether the Fed would continue to ease rates. (The Fed cut rates in September, November, and December but has since paused.)\nFurther rate cuts would have curtailed banks’ lending margins, which were supercharged by the central bank’s years-long tightening campaign. But the big banks could have done just fine in a low-rate environment because they can lean on other commercial operations to cover revenue losses elsewhere.\nThe diversified nature of financial services allows the nation's biggest banks to profit even when the outlook grows darker. It's not clear how the American exceptionalism trade will unfold in the months ahead. Tax cuts and other business-friendly deregulatory efforts are in the offing.\nIn the meantime, as long as money is still moving and greasing the trading gears, at least one part of Wall Street will be happy.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

(LBRT), which Wright led until his appointment to Trump’s cabinet, has tumbled 43% this year, one of the most precipitous declines among US energy stocks. The value of Wright’s stake in Liberty has fallen by nearly half to about $30 million over that period.\nLiberty’s rout is a warning that all is not well in America’s shale patch, despite Trump’s pledge to achieve “energy dominance.” Oil field servicers often provide the first indication of an industry downturn because they’re the ones hired to drill and frack new wells. After the trade war and OPEC’s recent decision to hike production knee-capped crude prices, investors expect US shale producers to avoid pumping more barrels into an oversupplied market.\nA drop in spending on services means US oil production could stall, or even decline this year, for the first time since the pandemic. So far, servicers are getting the brunt of the impact from tariff fears: An index of the companies has slid 28% this year, compared with 7% for oil and gas producers.\n“It’s just going to be painful,” said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at energy-focused financial services firm Pickering Energy Partners. “What comes next, and we’ve already heard whispers of this, it will be slowing down of drilling activity, releasing frack crews.”\nLiberty is due to kick off earnings season for oil field servicers on Wednesday after the market closes, with larger rivals Halliburton Co. (HAL), Baker Hughes Co. (BKR) and SLB (SLB) to follow next week.\nOil field service companies are largely dependent on producer spending on drilling and fracking new wells for their income, leaving them uniquely vulnerable to downturns. Producers like Diamondback Energy Inc. and Devon Energy Corp., by contrast, can continue to earn revenue from their existing wells. Plus, they have the option of hedging oil prices and renegotiating for lower-cost drilling contracts.\nEven before tariffs, servicers had been suffering from lower demand as shale producers become more efficient, which means fewer drilling days and workers to do the same job. Investors will find out soon if further cuts are coming as contracts inked before the trade war expire and producers respond to the slump in crude prices.\nWest Texas Intermediate crude oil, the US benchmark, closed at $61.33 on Tuesday, down 14% this year.\n“We would not be surprised to see US oil output decline” if low prices persist, Barclays Plc analysts led by Amarpreet Singh wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\nA representative for Liberty declined to comment, citing a mandated quiet period ahead of the company’s earnings release. Wright didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The energy secretary did, however, put a positive spin on the market in an interview with Bloomberg TV on April 11. Trump’s election gave a “green light” to increase production, with pledges to roll back regulation and expand oil lease sales and permitting, he said.\n“Now there is extra fear of world economic growth in the next few months among the tariffs dialogue,” he said. “The marketplace may be discounting the wrong answer here. We will see very positive economic growth in the next few years.”\nInvestors and analysts aren’t convinced. US revenue for the five biggest frack providers is expected to drop by almost $1 billion this year, a 5% decline and the second consecutive annual drop, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last week, producers idled oil rigs in US shale fields at the fastest pace in almost two years.\nUS shale is on the brink of major cutbacks, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM). The industry will cut 50 oil rigs at a sustained $60 a barrel WTI price, reducing production by half a million barrels a day, analysts led by Arun Jayaram wrote in a note this week. If prices drop to $55 a barrel, the impact doubles, the analysts said.\nPrices falling below $60 “will create softness that’s going to cost us jobs,” said T.M. “Roe” Patterson, co-founder and managing partner at private equity fund Marauder Capital. “We’re going stack rigs and we’re going to see an industry pullback,” Patterson said.\nStill, oil field servicers are unlikely to go bankrupt in droves like they did during the 2014 and 2020 downturns. Balance sheets are much healthier after the pandemic as companies focus on capital discipline, said Jeff Krimmel, owner of energy strategy consulting firm Krimmel Strategy Group.\n“It’s not like you’re going to see huge swaths of the sector struggling with liquidity, struggling to pay their bills,” Krimmel said. “For the ones that are best differentiated with technology, this might actually be an opportunity for them to make a more compelling case even than they have to this point.”\nFor his part, Wright wants the oil patch to focus on the benefits he says the Trump administration will bring over the long term. Trump has been clear about his desire for more crude output and lower prices, which will help bring “prosperity at home and peace abroad,” Wright said.\nPredictions “of the demise of demand growth for oil are older than I am,” he said in the Bloomberg TV interview. “A long-term growth rate of oil has been going on for decades. I don’t see any big change in that in the foreseeable future.”\nBut concerns about demand are riding high in an industry that overwhelmingly supported Trump with cash and votes in his run for the White House.\n“I would like to see the administration do a little more to put some consistency in their messaging around crude oil and to backstop pricing a little bit,” Patterson said. “Frankly, everything they’re saying right now is kind of counterintuitive.”\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nIt's been a rough start to 2025, with the S&P 500 having its worst quarter since 2022 followed by escalating trade tensions in April.

Houlihan Lokey was the only adviser to have advised on more than 50 deals during Q1 2025. Meanwhile, JP Morgan was among the only two advisers that managed to surpass the $100bn mark in total deal value during the review period, but still it was comfortably ahead of the firm occupying the second position by value.\n“More than half of the deals advised by JP Morgan during Q1 2025 were billion-dollar deals* and involvement in these big-ticket deals helped it secure the top position by value. During Q1 2025, it advised on 25 billion-dollar deals that also included four mega deals valued more than or equal to $10bn.”\nThe analysis further indicates that Goldman Sachs ranked second in terms of value, advising on $110.9bn worth of deals, followed by Morgan Stanley with $89bn, Citi with $76.5bn, and Barclays with $66.7bn.\nIn terms of deal volume, JP Morgan held the second position with 43 transactions, followed by Goldman Sachs with 36 deals, Morgan Stanley with 31 deals, and Piper Sandler with 25 deals.\nGlobalData’s league tables are based on the real-time tracking of thousands of company websites, advisory firm websites and other reliable sources available on the secondary domain. A dedicated team of analysts monitors all these sources to gather in-depth details for each deal, including adviser names.\nTo ensure further robustness to the data, the company also seeks submissions of deals from leading advisers.\n\n\n\n                The gold standard of business intelligence.\n            \n\n\n                    Find out more\n                    \n\n\n\n\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights. \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                Private Banker In Brief                                                                                                                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                        Private Banker International : Private Banker International Focus (monthly)                                                                                                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                Thematic Take (monthly)                                                                                                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                    I consent to Verdict Media Limited collecting my details provided via this form in accordance with  Privacy Policy\n\n\nView all newsletters from across the GlobalData Media network.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPowered by\n\t\t\t\t\n\n© Verdict Media Limited 2025\nThese cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.

These simple reforms could lower the cost of mortgages by 70–80 basis points.\"\nThis push for reform comes as JPMorgan's mortgage volume fell to $11.2 billion in the first quarter ending March 31, down from $14.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, home lending from the bank's retail channel fell to $9.4 billion from $12.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nOther banks have also struck a similar tone during recent conference calls following quarterly earnings.\nBank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan told investors during the company’s first quarter earnings call this week that he is hopeful for change as new policymakers take office.\n\"It’s critically important that we get this rebalance,\" Moynihan said. \"Sometimes the regulation gets in the way of that.” At Bank of America, home lending held steady at $254 billion in the first quarter, unchanged from the previous quarter.\nWells Fargo (WFC) CEO Charles Scharf echoed Dimon’s sentiment, telling analysts last week that the bank supports the administration’s deregulatory push. Scharf said the proposed changes would allow \"more loans, take more deposits, and provide more liquidity to the markets while preserving robust regulatory oversight.\"\nWells Fargo’s mortgage volume fell to $4.4 billion in the first quarter ending March 31, down from $5.9 billion the previous quarter, further underscoring the broader slowdown in housing financing activity.\nData from the National Association of Realtors showed pending home sales, a forward looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings, grew 2% in February. However, pending transactions are down 3.6% year over year, underscoring the ongoing challenges in the housing market.\nThe average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage stood at 6.92% as of last week, not far from the highest levels seen over the last several years.\nRead more: Best low- and no-down-payment mortgage lenders of 2025\nThe banking industry has long been lobbying for a scaled-back version of the “Basel Endgame” capital rule, which requires financial institutions to hold significantly more capital as part of a broader post-2008 effort to strengthen the financial system.\nBanks argue that higher capital requirements restrict their ability to offer mortgages, car loans, credit cards, and small business loans.\nPresident Trump's Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, in a speech last week before the American Bankers Association, called for \"modernizing\" capital requirements but said the latest proposal \"is not, in my opinion, the right starting point for our modernization effort.\"\nBessent added, \"Modernizing regulatory capital likely would mean reduced capital requirements for mortgage loans and some other exposures that are core to the community bank model.\"\nMeanwhile, Trump officials are also revisiting efforts to privatize Fannie and Freddie, a major policy goal that first Trump administration couldn't pull off. Bessent said the decision to release the two companies will come down to the trajectory of mortgage rates.\nIn his annual letter, JPMorgan's Dimon cited data from the Urban Institute estimating that mortgage market reforms could boost mortgage originations by 1 million annually, particularly helping lower-income borrowers and first-time homebuyers targeting homes in the $150,000-$300,000 range.\nRead more: 2025 housing market: Is it a good time to buy a house?\nAccording to Zillow, the average US home value sits at $361,263, up 2.1% over the past year.\n“Buying a home, still a pillar of the American Dream, is simply the best way for individuals to start building household wealth,” Dimon wrote.\nDani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Some top leaders have expressed to me that the tariffs are putting their businesses into a state of chaos.\nBessent added, \"They'll [CEOs] also have clarity on tax and on deregulation. I remember in 2017 I heard a lot of the same things because the tax deal wasn't done until right before Christmas in 2017. And it was the same thing. We can't plan. We can't do this. We need clarity. So, you know, we're going to have clarity on tax. We're going to have clarity on deregulation.\"\nRead more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\nCorporate America has sounded the alarm on the state of the economy amid the tariff turmoil.\nJPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said in a recent TV interview that a recession is likely.

How that's translating is that people are spending less. They're out less in restaurants. They're spending less on consumer goods and consumables.\"\nThe Corona and Modelo beer maker has seen beer sales go flat amid the economic uncertainty.\nBessent said about the recession concerns from Dimon and Solomon: \"Look, that's their job is to be concerned. But again, I think that there is all this chatter on tariffs and what we're worried about. And, you know, I come from Wall Street, I think Wall Street can continue to do great, but we are focused on Main Street.\"\nThe concerns from CEOs have been well placed.\nOn April 9, the Trump administration announced a 90-day pause on all reciprocal tariffs, with the exception being China. The tariffs on China, one of the US's most important trading partners, now stand at 145%.\nA 10% across-the-board tax is still being applied to all imports to the US.\nThe administration further refined its tariff plans on April 11.\nThe White House issued a rule that spared smartphones, computers, semiconductors, and other electronics from reciprocal tariffs — especially the harsher ones on Chinese goods. The US Customs and Border Patrol said that the goods would be excluded from Trump's 10% global tariff on most countries and the much more significant 145% tariffs on Chinese imports.\nBessent suggested a trade deal with China remains in the distance.\nTrump quickly downplayed that he was reversing course on tariffs, noting electronics would still get hit.\n\"There was no Tariff ‘exception’,\" Trump said in a social media post on Sunday. \"These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket.'\"\nThe administration is working on a semiconductor tariff, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) has recovered to a decline of 4.67% beneath its level at the April 2 tariff announcement, but a decline is still a decline.

Analysts at Bank of America, Piper Sandler, and Raymond James lowered their price targets for the chipmaker stock.\nApple's (AAPL) India suppliers shipped $2 billion worth of iPhones in March ahead of US President Trump's tariffs.\nWall Street's top financial firms, like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS), saw record-high trading revenue in the first quarter, driven by tariff-fueled market volatility.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.\nIt's now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Nvidia, Apple, and Wall Street banks. First up, several Wall Street firms cutting their price targets on Nvidia stock after the chip maker disclosed that it anticipates a $5.5 billion charge from new chip curbs. The US government told Nvidia earlier this month it would need a special license to export certain chips to China. Analysts at BFA Global Research, Piper Sandler, and Raymond James all lowering their price targets on the news. And also, Steve, what I also thought was really interesting here is an analyst over at City talking about how it's not just about Nvidia. This could also impact Broadcom. This could also impact other chip names in the space.\nWell, you're seeing them, you're seeing them sell off today. I mean, you know, AMD announced an $800 million charge along in there. Um, you know, Broadcom was trading lower this morning as well. ASML was trading lower, although they released earnings, but, but they're all, they're all part and parcel of this. This is not good news for the chip sector, because, you know, I, I don't mean to just sound like a broken record, but this is uncertainty, and uncertainty, the markets don't love uncertainty.\nWell, speaking, speaking of uncertainty, let's get to another name we're looking at. Apple's main suppliers in India shipping roughly $2 billion worth of iPhones in March ahead of President Trump's reciprocal tariffs announcement. That is according to new customs data. Smartphones have since secured a temporary reprieve from tariffs, but persistent tensions between the US and China threaten the iPhone maker's China-focused supply chain in the longer term. The Wall Street Journal reporting Apple is investigating moving some iPhone production to the US, but the process could take years, and CEO Tim Cook has said in the past that it would be difficult to find the skilled labor in America that's needed to build the smartphones. Treasury Secretary Scott Beson dismissed that comment and concern in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\nYou don't need a PhD in mechanical engineering to assemble an iPhone. So, I, I'm not sure why Tim Cook says that the skills aren't here.\nAnd Steve, I think what analysts who cover Apple might say and investors might say is that that skilled labor does take years to build up, and it's certainly something that allows Apple to turn out these iPhones incredibly quickly.\nWell, that's it. I mean, every, you know, labor now is not just, you know, pounding a hammer or nail. There, there's, there's, there's intricacies in the supply chain. You know, I, I know that, you know, the commerce secretary with his comment, you know, we're going to have lots of people screwing tiny little screws into things. That's not what people really want. You know, we want the high-tech value-added manufacturing because, quite frankly, our cost basis is higher. So, if there's value-added stuff to be done, that's great. If it's just, if it's just bringing low-skilled labor, bringing back low-skilled jobs, that's not necessarily, you know, I understand the need for that, particularly maybe in some strategic industries, but overall, I think we want people bringing a skill set to it. You know, I saw a statistic, this was posted on, on, on Twitter by my friend Frank Luntz who I trust. Um, and he got the statistics from the Cato Institute. 80% of the people when asked, said, do you want more manufacturing in the US? 80% said yes. When asked, would you take a factory job? 75% said no. 23% said yes. The other two said I already have a factory job. So, it, it's, you know, it's one of these, it's nice in theory, but in practice, um, you know, you need skilled, the people who are going to take these jobs, by definition, are really going to be skilled labor. Not, not just, you know, people, not just, you know, automatons screwing in screws.\nYeah. Right. The price that they're requiring for their labor requires it to be skilled. All right. Finally, trading desks at some of the biggest names in banking crashed in, cashed in, rather, on market volatility in the most recent quarter. And that is not including the past two weeks, which fell outside of that reporting period. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Goldman, all seeing record equity trading revenue during the quarter. Despite the blockbuster results, executives did express some caution about the current macro backdrop. JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon warning of considerable turbulence roiling the US economy. Well, Goldman's David Solomon said the prospects of a recession had increased. You couldn't pay Solomon to mention the word tariffs, but he did semi-maybe allude to it in that comment. Is this trading revenue for banks a signal of strength in your view, Steve? Or is this something that can kind of hide any economic macro concerns?\nKind of the latter. You know, I remember I spent the bulk of my career as an option trader, and I used, I loved environments like this. Um, you know, and to Jamie Dimon's comment, you know, about turbulence, you know, I always described VIX as sort of the price of a parachute when the plane hits turbulence at some level. You know, people want that protection. But here's what happens during volatility with, if you're an active trader. You widen your spreads, you shrink your sizes. So, effectively that really impairs liquidity, but if you're the person trading off those bid offs, bid-ask spreads, each trade you do is more profitable. And so, yes, that leads to the trading desks making more money, but really, you know, analysts typically discount that over time. It's actually a little odd this quarter that the analysts are very happy that the banks are making all this money trading because for years, again, as a trader at a publicly traded firm, the analysts were always very dismissive when we had a good quarter.\nYeah. Right, right, because it's potentially not a sign of continued gains for, for the banks. Steve, thank you so much for sticking with us.

The bank has filed five new lawsuits on the state level after winning four federal suits filed last October. Chase recouped about $580,000 of the $660,000 it sought out in the original batch of litigation.\nJPMorgan Chase is continuing efforts to recover hundreds of thousands of dollars lost after an ATM “glitch” went viral, leading customers to steal funds from the bank during the malfunction.\nJPMorgan is pursuing legal action on the state level, suing customers who allegedly stole $75,000 or less from the company, CNBC first reported. Last October, the bank filed four federal lawsuits, and, as of Monday, has won them all, recouping about $580,000 of the $660,000 it sought out, with dollar amounts not finalized for all cases.\nLast August, social-media users uploaded videos explaining a “glitch” stemming from ATM malfunctions, which would allow Chase bank customers to write a fake check, deposit it into an ATM, and withdraw cash over the course of a week when some of the deposited funds become immediately available, but before the check bounces. The practice, known as check-kiting, is illegal.\nAccording to a Tuesday court filing in Gwinnett County, Georgia, seen by CNBC, one “masked man” deposited a $73,000 check in the defendant’s Chase bank account. Per the lawsuit, the check bounced six days later, but not before the defendant made a series of cash withdrawals worth $82,000. The defendant allegedly owes Chase nearly $58,000 and has not complied with requests to return the cash.\nJPMorgan has filed five total lawsuits on the state level: one each in New York, Florida, Georgia, and two in Texas, the company confirmed to Fortune. Since October, when JPMorgan first pursued litigation on the issue, the company has sent out more than 1,000 letters to customers asking them to repay the funds.\n“We’re still investigating cases of fraud and cooperating with law enforcement—and we’ll do that for as long as it takes to hold fraudsters accountable,” JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Drew Pusateri told Fortune in a statement.\nChase’s ATM woes aren’t unique. In August 2023, Bank of Ireland customers took advantage of an ATM glitch that allowed them to pull large sums of money from their accounts and transfer up to €1,000 (~$1,090) to other accounts, even if the funds were more than what was available in their accounts, leading them to mistakenly think they were getting “free money.”\nThe bank warned customers they would be liable for the money they withdrew and should return the cash, should they not be prepared to have the money debited from their accounts.\nJPMorgan has been clear in its views on schemes such as the one some took advantage of last year.\n“Chase takes its responsibility to combat fraud seriously and prioritizes protecting the firm and its customers to make the banking system safer,” the bank said in an October court filing. “Part of that responsibility is to hold people accountable when they commit fraud against Chase and its customers. Simply put, engaging in bank fraud is a crime.”\nWhile legal consequences for check fraud vary by state and the amount of money taken, repercussions can be steep. In New York, it can result in up to 25 years in prison, Adam H. Rosenblum, an attorney and founder of Rosenblum Law, told Fortune in September. Individuals can avoid steep punishment if they took out smaller sums of money, and if they return the funds and work with an attorney.\n“Very often, these consequences can be mitigated and minimized if things are handled in the right way,” he said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\nCEOs have warned on the economy because of Trump administration tariff policies.

The moves in yields accelerated as equities slumped more than 2%.\nThe “bond market is comforted by Powell’s sanguine outlook on funding conditions and reserve abundance, but the equity market is getting anxious as investors are looking for the Powell put — which is not there yet,” said Tracy Chen, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management. “There is no sense of urgency to act from Powell. He is in a wait-and-see mode given all the uncertainty in tariff standoff.”\nThe rally in bonds also followed a solid $13 billion sale of 20-year bonds, which was awarded at 4.81% compared with a 4.814% when-issued yield at the 1 p.m. New York time bidding deadline.\nEarlier, data showed US retail sales rose substantially in March on a jump in car purchases and other goods such as electronics, suggesting consumers were scrambling to get ahead of tariffs.\nIn sharp contrast with the state of market a week ago, when Trump’s about-face on tariffs shook investors, futures volumes on Wednesday were well below recent levels. By about 3 p.m. New York time, Treasury contracts were running at about 60% of 20-day average, with SOFR futures at a similar level.\nTo Gregory Faranello, head of US rates trading and strategy for AmeriVet Securities, the Treasury market is now trading more cleanly than it was earlier in the month as the risk of global tariffs raised threats to the economy, undermining Treasuries’ reputation as the world’s safest asset.\n“Positions feel better balanced, so back to a risk-off” market, he said. Faranello favors five-year notes “if the Fed is going to be reactionary versus preemptive.”\nPowell’s Message\nPowell’s comments, delivered at the Economic Club of Chicago, were in sharp focus across Wall Street after a bout of volatility in the $29 trillion Treasury market.\nThe Fed chief acknowledged that tension was building between the central bank’s dual mandates of ensuring US growth while keeping inflation checked.\nStill, he echoed Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, who’d pointed out that there’s good reason for officials to hold interest rates at current levels until there is more clarity on how tariffs and other policy changes will impact the economy.\nTraders were pricing in about 90 basis points of easing by the end of the year, implying a minimum of three quarter-point reductions starting in July. At JPMorgan Chase & Co., economist Michael Feroli said that Powell’s comments were consistent with the bank’s view that the first cut of the year will actually come in September.\nPowell said that despite recent volatility, the market was functioning, so there wasn’t a need for the Fed to step in now. The remark jolted US equity markets, and helped fuel a further advance in bonds.\nThe dollar, meanwhile, held tight to its losses — bringing its year-to-date decline to 6.4%, according to a Bloomberg gauge.\nHe also said the Fed’s recent decision to slow the pace of its balance-sheet runoff — known as quantitative tightening — and the fact that reserves remain abundant mean the central bank can continue QT longer.\n--With assistance from James Hirai.\n(Updates prices, adds comments throughout.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nApple stock fell more than 2% late Wednesday morning, once again putting its market capitalization below the $3 trillion mark after a brief rally.\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in prepared remarks in Chicago that the central bank would wait for more data before changing interest rates.\nMarch retail sales jumped as consumers rushed to buy autos and Apple iPhones before the impact of Trump tariffs.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank would wait for more data on the economy's direction before changing interest rates.  Speaking to the Economic Club of Chicago, he noted that there was a potentially tough situation developing for the Fed in which inflation is pushed higher by tariffs while growth and potentially, employment, weaken.\nTrump's Treasury secretary wants business owners to relax.

Here’s what you should know.\n(Reuters) -The ripple effects of Donald Trump's global trade war are increasingly being felt across numerous industries all at once and on Wednesday were once again exerting pressure on U.S. stock markets that have been roiled for weeks by his erratic trade policies.  Stocks fell broadly, with tech stocks hit particularly hard after bellwethers like Nvidia that are highly tied into the world's supply chain warned of hits to their bottom line.  Meanwhile, airlines said they are bracing for an uncertain summer travel season, and the head of the Federal Reserve noted slowing economic activity - but also cast a wary eye on the threat that tariffs pose to its goal of lowering inflation.\nTech stocks are leading Wall Street lower as new export restriction take the U.S-China trade war to a new and damaging level.\nTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results\nSign in to access your portfolio\n\n\n\nTry again."

There are several top stocks offering yields much better than the S&P 500 average of 1.44%, but some of these businesses are struggling competitively and are only offering high yields because their share prices have collapsed.\nIt's ideal to find high-yield stocks of strong companies that are delivering solid financial results and showing share price appreciation potential. Here are two dividend payers that are doing just that.\nCoca-Cola (KO -0.19%) has historically weathered recessions well. It has increased the dividend for 63 consecutive years after recently increasing its quarterly payment by 5% to $0.51. It's a great option for someone looking to boost their portfolio's average yield with relatively low risk.\nCoca-Cola generates a significant portion of its annual revenue from making concentrate syrup for its trademark brand. This is a capital-light business model that churns out robust profits. The company's profit margin has remained above 20% over the last five years. \nDespite choppy consumer spending behavior, global unit case volume grew 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 1% for 2024. The company continues to adjust its marketing strategy and capitalize on its knowledge of local markets globally to drive sales. The company has been particularly effective at linking its beverages to different occasions, such as music or food, that resonate with consumers.\nThe stock has climbed 20% over the last year, and it currently offers a forward dividend yield of 2.88%. Analysts expect Coca-Cola to grow earnings at an annualized rate of 6% over the next several years. Combined with the high yield, investors can expect to earn an average annual return around 9%, which is slightly less than the historical return of the S&P 500 but with the advantage of earning a much higher dividend yield.\nLeading wireless service providers are very resilient in recessions. Eliminating a phone or internet payment plan is probably the last thing people are going to cut in a recession. Shares of AT&T (T -1.85%) have climbed about 59% over the last year, driven by healthy demand for wireless phone plans and high-speed internet service.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nAT&T cut its dividend in 2022 to shore up funds to service its debt. The company's current quarterly dividend is $0.2775, bringing its forward yield to 4.2%. Instead of increasing its dividend, management has left the dividend unchanged as it focuses on paying down debt and investing for growth.\nIt's normal for telecoms to use a lot of debt, since they benefit from regular monthly bills from customers, which provides a high level of certainty for annual revenue and cash flows. The company's debt has declined from $177 billion in 2021 to $123 billion in 2024, while paying out less than half its free cash flow in dividends over the past year.\nAT&T entered 2025 with momentum. It reported 1.7 million postpaid phone net additions last year, which refers to the monthly bills people pay for wireless service. The company also added 1 million AT&T Fiber net additions for the seventh consecutive year. It aims to keep pressure on competitors by focusing on delivering quality service and good deals. \nThe company generated more than $17 billion in free cash flow last year on $122 billion of revenue. The 4.2% forward yield, combined with management's optimism that it can grow AT&T's business to increase the share price, makes this an excellent income investment for 2025 and beyond.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, described the 145% duty on China as so extreme that it essentially acts as an embargo rather than a conventional tariff.\n“We now have 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, a number that high frankly isn’t really a tariff. It’s more of an embargo. Almost nobody’s gonna pay that much of a markup. It’s a recipe for losing money.”\nREAD ALSO 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently and Jim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks\nCramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump’s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. “As a nation, shamefully, we’ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,” he said\n“I think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.”\nCramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. “Yes, we have to take them on now or never,” he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept.\n“So the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it’s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it’s not worth it to go back… [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I’m actually thinking that might be where we’\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) produces nonalcoholic drinks that include soft drinks, water, tea, juice, and plant-based options. It also supplies beverage concentrates and syrups for sale through retail channels. During the episode, Cramer stated, “Utility, Verizon, perfect Coca-Cola, Waste Management. Yeah, these are timeless.”\nOn March 31, during an episode of Squawk on the Street, Cramer mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and said:\n“In terms of shorting, like if you wanna short, do you short Coca-Cola? No, cause Coca-Cola in 2000, after the NASDAQ broke, was really a terrific stock to own… Look at that April 14th to April 17th 2000 period when we had this dramatic switch. Which was rather incredible, which was the fastest I’ve seen where Coca-Cola went from being a loser to a winner. I think we’re there. Coca-Cola’s having a good quarter.”\nOverall, KO ranks 7th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of KO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +3.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.6% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coca-Cola belongs, has gained 1.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCoca-Cola is expected to post earnings of $0.72 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.96 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.19 indicates a change of +8.1% from what Coca-Cola is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Coca-Cola.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Coca-Cola, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $47.99 billion and $50.46 billion estimates indicate +2% and +5.1% changes, respectively.\nCoca-Cola reported revenues of $11.54 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.4%. EPS of $0.55 for the same period compares with $0.49 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.69 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.01%. The EPS surprise was +7.84%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCoca-Cola is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coca-Cola. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar.\nOn Thursday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer cautioned viewers about what may lie ahead once the 90-day pause on new tariffs comes to an end. While discussing the latest Consumer Price Index report, Cramer acknowledged that the numbers looked favorable, with inflation appearing relatively tame and even some categories experiencing actual price declines. He pointed to energy prices, saying, “The best, anything it touched energy, which is plummeting.”\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks and 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently.\n“This is essentially an embargo. President Trump’s ecstatic that the tariffs are already taking in $2 billion a day. He’s thrilled that supposedly 75 countries are begging for something more reasonable than the 90-day pause when the 90-day pause comes to an end.”\nAccording to Cramer, President Trump is “ecstatic” that these tariffs are already generating $2 billion a day in revenue and is thrilled about 75 countries “supposedly” asking for something more workable once the 90-day grace period concludes. Despite the seemingly positive revenue flow, Cramer expressed concern over the broader consequences. He pointed out that many Americans have yet to grasp the full impact of trade policies that have allowed foreign businesses to flood U.S. markets with inexpensive products, often pricing out domestic companies.\nWhile many consumers embraced the lower costs, Cramer reminded his audience that it came at the expense of American jobs. “Now we’re going to have to pay a price. He stressed that consumers should be prepared to pay significantly more for a wide range of goods. He said that the additional cost largely will likely benefit foreign companies, which will hike prices in response to the tariffs imposed on them. He clarified his position by stating he is not a staunch advocate of free trade for its own sake. “No other country plays by the rules on trade, so we shouldn’t either,” he said but cautioned:\n“We just have to be more thoughtful about this or we’ll end up doing more harm than good. Again, as someone who wants fair trade, not free trade, I am rooting for the president to pull this off, but not at the expense of great American companies that have done nothing wrong and are the best in the world.”\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA row of factory workers assembling bottles of sparkling soft drinks on a conveyor belt.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\nA caller asked what Cramer thought of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and he replied:\n“I love that…. James Quincey is terrific. It’s got a good dividend. It’s really well run. It’s got an international presence… and it’s doing well in this environment. You have a winner.”\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that offers a wide variety of nonalcoholic drinks. Its products include soft drinks, water, tea, juice, plant-based options, concentrates, and syrups for retail use. In February, Cramer said:\n“… Sometimes companies can practically print money simply because they’re so well run. Take Coca-Cola. Under the steady hand of James Quincey, Coca-Cola has become a low-risk juggernaut with a solid dividend, definitely a stock that is worth owning.”\nOverall, KO ranks 3rd on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar. While we acknowledge the potential of KO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nWarren Buffett is famous because of the long-term success he has achieved running Berkshire Hathaway. But there are two interesting things about this company. First, it is run kind of like a mutual fund. Second, it doesn't pay dividends despite the fact that Buffett often invests in dividend-paying companies. Here's why that matters and why you might want to buy one of these three dividend payers he owns.\nOne of the core tenets of Buffett's investment approach is to buy good companies when they are attractively priced. But the next step is to hold for the long term so he can benefit from the growth of the businesses he buys. One of the nuances that gets lost in this is that he uses the cash generated from the companies he owns outright or owns in Berkshire Hathaway's common stock portfolio to reinvest in his business. That allows him to compound those cash flows over time and this enhances the returns he generates for investors.\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\nFrom a big-picture perspective, you can do the same thing by dividend reinvesting. All it takes is a phone call to your broker, or, more likely, a button press on your broker's website or in its app. And in one quick and easy move you'll be investing more like Warren Buffett.\nBut what if you want to invest even more like Oracle of Omaha? Well, three dividend-paying stocks he owns today are Coca-Cola (KO -0.19%), Chevron (CVX 0.65%), and Kraft Heinz (KHC -2.00%). Here's a look at these three Buffett stocks to see if they'll be a good fit for your Buffett style dividend reinvesting.\nCoca-Cola is a very easy company to like. It is the industry-leading beverage company with a globally diversified business. It is large enough to have economies of scale in distribution, marketing, and research and development, and it can, and does, act as an industry consolidator. The dividend has been increased annually for over five decades, making it a Dividend King. The dividend yield is 2.9%, which is well above the market's yield today.\nFor conservative dividend investors it is a solid choice. The only problem is that the stock looks a little expensive at the moment, with both the price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios above their five-year averages. However, if you are willing to pay a premium for income security, Coca-Cola could be a good fit for your portfolio.\nAnother industry leader in Buffett's portfolio is energy giant Chevron. It is one of the largest integrated energy companies you can buy, with a business that spans from the upstream (energy production) through the midstream (pipelines) and into the downstream (chemicals and refining). This diversification helps to soften the impact of the inherent swings in the commodity-driven energy sector. On top of that, the company has a very strong balance sheet, which allows it to take on leverage during industry downturns to support its business and dividend.\nThe dividend, notably, has been increased annually for 38 years thanks largely to Chevron's solid business model. That said, energy price volatility still has a material impact on the stock price. Right now energy prices are weakening and the dividend yield is a very attractive 4.7%. The yield could go higher if oil prices continue to fall. But the history here suggests that the dividend will continue to get paid even if oil prices continue to fall. You could try to time your entry into Chevron, but the truth is it is a strong energy choice at just about any point of the energy cycle.\nThe last big dividend stock on this list is Kraft Heinz. It is a tough consumer staples stock to love when you compare it to Coca-Cola. Yes, Kraft Heinz's dividend yield is a lofty 5.3%, but the dividend has been static since it was cut in 2019. The big story is the business overhaul that's taking place.\nThe company was created via the merger between Kraft and Heinz. The goal at that time was to cut costs to boost profitability. But cutting costs can only take a company so far before it needs to refocus on growth. That's what Kraft Heinz has been doing, after turning to a new management team. But the results haven't been particularly impressive, which is why the dividend has been stuck in neutral for so long. If you consider this high-yield food maker you'll need to go in understanding that it is a turnaround story that will require extra monitoring.

Operating in the consumer staples space, consumers tend to keep buying its products right through periods of stock market and economic turmoil. That's how Coca-Cola has managed to support and grow its dividend through the years despite often material headwinds.\nWhile Coca-Cola is an elite company, it is far from the only consumer staples maker that can help you rest easy amid stock market unrest. Here are a few others.\nIf the stock market falls into a bear market are you going to stop buying toothpaste, toilet paper, and soda? If the economy succumbs to a recession, will you stop using soap, laundry detergent, and food? That answer, I hope, to those two questions is no. And this is why consumer staples makers are so attractive during troubled times (if not all the time).\nImage source: Getty Images.\nMany of the products that companies like Coca-Cola sell aren't actually necessities. In this case you could just drink tap water instead of soda. However, the cost of most consumer staples products is fairly modest while the benefits are material, even if those benefits are really just emotional. Brand loyalty tends to run high in the consumer staples niche. Even better, consumer staples products are bought frequently because they get used regularly.\nIf you are having trouble sleeping at night amid market uncertainty, you should consider adding some more consumer staples stocks to your portfolio mix.\nCoca-Cola is a solid choice for highly conservative investors. It has an above-market dividend yield of 2.9% backed by a dividend that has been increased annually for more than 50 years, making this beverage giant a Dividend King. The company has a global distribution network, strong R&D skills, and massive marketing heft. The only problem is that the stock looks a little expensive right now, with its price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios both above their five-year averages. If you're willing to pay up for safety, you might want to buy Coca-Cola.\nBut beverage peer PepsiCo (PEP -1.88%) has similar business strengths and a more diversified portfolio that includes snacks and packaged foods. It is also a Dividend King. However, the real attraction lies in its valuation, with PepsiCo's P/S and P/E ratios both below their five-year averages. Its dividend yield is an even higher 3.7%. And with PepsiCo investing in growth through bolt-on acquisitions, it is continuing to grow its business with the same playbook that has worked well for more than five decades.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nThat said, you might want something a little different. Unilever (UL 0.61%) could be just what you are looking for, with its portfolio of consumer products and food. The big story with Unilever is that North America and Europe only make up around 40% of its top line, with the rest coming from Latin America and Asia, where economic growth is expected to be higher over the long term. Add in a 3.1% dividend yield and this is an attractive consumer staples option for those with a more adventurous bent.\nThen there are ultra high yielders like Altria (MO -0.40%) and British American Tobacco (BTI -1.21%). Both of these cigarette makers are facing material long-term headwinds as the volume of the cigarettes they sell has been in decline for years. However, smokers tend to be very loyal and often increase their use of cigarettes during uncertain times. During the coronavirus pandemic, both Altria and British American Tobacco put up their strongest volume numbers in years.\nWhile these two tobacco companies come with material long-term risks, the short-term benefit of collecting Altria's 7.2% yield and British American Tobacco's 7.5% yield might be worth it for some investors. Given the nature of cigarettes, those lofty yields are likely to be safe over the near term.\nAlthough all of the companies listed here are attractive in their own way, the list is hardly exhaustive. There are many more consumer staples stocks that are worth looking at if you are worried about the market and fear a recession. While there is no way to fully avoid the impact of either of these big-picture events, buying companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Unilever, Altria, and British American Tobacco can help ease your worries and let you rest a little better thanks to their reliable businesses and dividends.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

Goldman Sachs has hiked its recession probability a few times in recent weeks, bumping it from 20% all the way to 45%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan is even more bearish. Its recession model sees a nearly 80% chance the economy goes into a recession, up from 60% not long ago. \nRecessions tend to cause corporate profits to decline, which drives many companies to cut costs through layoffs and other initiatives. Some companies will even cut or suspend their dividend payments to shareholders to conserve cash. \nHowever, other companies are more recession-resistant due to the durability of their cash flows and the strength of their balance sheets. ExxonMobil (XOM 1.04%) and Coca-Cola (KO -0.19%) have proven their ability to weather recessions over the decades. They've both increased their dividends throughout at least the past four recessions. There's a good chance they can withstand the next one with similar ease. \n\nXOM Dividend data by YCharts. Gray bars are recessions.\nExxonMobil hiked its dividend payment by 4% earlier this year, extending its streak to 42 years of annual payment increases. \"We're proud of the fact that we've increased our annual dividend per share for 42 years in a row, something only 4% of S&P 500 companies can claim,\" stated CFO Kathy Mikells during the oil giant's fourth-quarter earnings conference call. She continued, \"And we plan for that track record to continue for decades to come, which is only possible by investing in the high-quality growth opportunities that drive leading returns and higher cash flows.\" \nThe energy company has been investing heavily in transforming its business to dramatically improve its underlying earnings power while also expanding into lower-carbon energy. This strategy has boosted its earnings capacity by nearly $14 billion over the past five years on a constant price and margin basis. Exxon plans to invest over $140 billion into major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program through 2030, which, along with structural cost savings, should add another $20 billion to its annual earnings capacity. \nThat incremental income will give Exxon even more fuel to grow its dividend, which is already on an incredibly safe foundation. Last year, Exxon produced $34.4 billion in free cash flow, easily covering its $16.7 billion dividend outlay. Meanwhile, it has a fortress balance sheet with an ultra-low 6% leverage ratio and a massive $23.2 billion cash balance. These factors put the oil giant's 3.8%-yielding dividend on a rock-solid foundation that should continue withstanding recessions. \nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nCoca-Cola boosted its dividend payment by 5.2% earlier this year. That extended its dividend growth streak to 63 straight years. That raise kept Coca-Cola in the ultra-elite group of Dividend Kings, companies with 50 or more years of annual dividend increases. \nThe company has benefited from the durable and growing demand for its beverage brands. Its portfolio features multiple billion-dollar brands that generate lots of free cash flow for the company. Coca-Cola expects to produce $9.5 billion in free cash flow this year, more than enough to cover its dividend outlay ($8.4 billion last year). The company also has a strong cash-rich balance sheet ($12.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments) with leverage at the low end of its target range. \nCoca-Cola's long-term target is to organically grow its revenue by 4%-6% annually, which should drive mid-to-high single-digit earnings-per-share growth. Meanwhile, the company can enhance its growth rate by making accretive acquisitions. That puts it in a strong position to continue increasing its 2.9%-yielding dividend. \nExxon and Coca-Cola have increased their dividends every year for several decades, which includes the last four recessions. They're in excellent positions to continue raising their payout during the next downturn, whether that happens later this year or further in the future. Because of that, they're great dividend stocks to buy for a durable passive income stream. \n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in ExxonMobil, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ExxonMobil wasn’t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (NASDAQ:CCEP) stands against other best performing European stocks to invest in.\nThe world economy is hanging by a thread, as the macroeconomic environment consists of trade wars, retaliatory tariffs, and political unrest in Ukraine and the Middle East. It adds to economic uncertainty, with market experts offering cautious economic forecasts. According to EY, the euro area will experience a modest economic turnaround in 2025, and growth is expected to increase from 0.7% last year to 1.3% and 1.8% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. It is forecasted to simmer down to 1.4% in 2027. Among all European countries, Malta is projected to experience the highest GDP growth in 2025 at 4%. EY expects soft employment growth across Europe, driven by demographic challenges and subdued labor demand. Unemployment will likely remain at 2024 levels. While nominal wage this year will clock in higher than pre-pandemic levels, wage growth will take a hit. Central and Eastern European countries are forecasted to experience relatively higher inflation in 2025, while the overall rate remains just over 2% in the euro area.\nMeanwhile, German economic institutes have slashed their growth projections for 2025 to 0.1% from the previous forecast of 0.8% in September 2024. This revised estimate does not incorporate the recent tariffs levied by the US. These tariffs will be a major setback for European economies, possibly toppling them over the edge of recession for the third consecutive year. The new conservative government declared a €500 billion fund to improve infrastructure and defence and stimulate growth. The fiscal package enhances the economic outlook for 2026 and 2027.\nHowever, as the United States is feeling the pressure from high valuations and growing political instability, analysts are looking towards Europe as a better bet for stock investors. Analysts point towards Europe offering a more stable outlook, with lower stock prices, clearer policy direction, and even potential interest rate cuts on the horizon. Investors seem to be shifting their focus, partly because the threat of US tariffs on Europe, especially on automobiles, feels less uncertain now that details are clearer. There is also less exposure to tech in Europe, which is seen as a good thing right now. Europe’s markets, with just 10% tech exposure in the Europe 600 compared to 30% in the broader market, look more balanced.\nWith solid earnings, rising share buybacks, and cheaper stock valuations, investors are turning to Europe. Experts suggest that European and UK markets now have their best shot in years at outperforming the US. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the best-performing stocks in Europe so far in 2025.\nA woman pouring a freshly made beverage from a large-scale bottling line.\nTo compile our list of the top performing European stocks this year, used the Finviz screener, applying filters for the region and a market cap of over 10 billion to identify stable European companies. Next, we applied a performance filter and selected 11 European stocks with the highest YTD share price growth as of April 11. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

CCEP ranks 10th on our list of the best performing stocks in Europe.\nOn April 8, Bernstein maintained a Market Perform rating on Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (NASDAQ:CCEP) and lifted the price target to $84.5 from $82, citing strong fundamentals and consistent dividends.

The company recorded a free cash flow of more than €1.8 billion, in addition to a new €1 billion share buyback program.\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (NASDAQ:CCEP) was part of 24 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 32 in the prior quarter. Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors was the leading stakeholder of the company, with 3.92 million shares valued at $301.3 million.\nOverall, CCEP ranks 10th among the 11 Top Performing European Stocks So Far In 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of European stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nThe stock market is in turmoil right now, and entering this week, the S&P 500 has declined by around 9% since the start of the year. For many investors, especially retirees, capital preservation has been top of mind. How can you keep your savings safe and still be invested in the stock market -- or is that even possible nowadays?\nOne blue chip stock you may be considering is Coca-Cola (KO -0.19%). The beverage company is known for its robust results and resiliency over the years. Can it be a good investment right now and be a way to help keep your portfolio safe?\nA huge advantage Coca-Cola has over other businesses is that it operates all over the world. That gives it flexibility. For example, President Donald Trump recently announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. But Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said that the company could adjust and use other packaging materials, such as plastic, to minimize the impact of those tariffs.\nThe company also has strong margins. Last year, Coca-Cola reported $10.6 billion in earnings on sales totaling $47.1 billion, which equates to a profit margin of nearly 23%. Even if there's an increase in costs, the company's strong profit margins put it in an excellent position to continue delivering solid earnings numbers. Coca-Cola, however, hasn't been a fast-growing business recently; from 2022 through 2024, its earnings grew by just 9%. \nThe last time the stock market was in a prolonged free fall was 2022. Growth stocks cratered amid concerns about rising inflation. Coca-Cola stock, however, proved to be a fairly safe investment at the time. Including its dividend, the stock's total returns were more than 10%, far better than the S&P 500's.\n\n^SPX data by YCharts\nHistorically, Coca-Cola has been a low-volatility stock to own, as it has averaged a beta of 0.45, indicating that it doesn't follow the market's swings. For investors seeking safety right now, that can make this an attractive investment. But it's important to remember that the past doesn't predict the future, and while Coca-Cola was able to pass on rising costs to consumers amid high inflation in recent years, it may not be as easy to do that now with many consumers feeling stretched.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nCoca-Cola stock can be a good place to park your money right now. If you just want to collect a good, safe dividend, this can be one of the better investments to consider putting in your portfolio today. Coca-Cola's business is rock solid and isn't going anywhere. It provides a dividend that yields 2.9% and can generate a lot of recurring income for you. \nThe only downside is that its growth prospects may not be all that strong, but this could still be an ideal stock to own if you're looking to keep your risk low and want some stable dividends. \n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500. Don't miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\nSee the 10 stocks ›\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\n\n\nDavid Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 64% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\nAnd things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$15b in market cap last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 27%.\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Coca-Cola, beginning with the chart below.\n See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola \nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\nWe can see that Coca-Cola does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Coca-Cola's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Coca-Cola is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.3% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.4% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.1% of the company stock.\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Coca-Cola Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. \nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 26% stake in Coca-Cola. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nPublic companies currently own 9.3% of Coca-Cola stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Coca-Cola better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Coca-Cola (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

PEP. These two titans have been battling it out for more than a century, not just on supermarket shelves but across airwaves, billboards and now digital screens. While the rivalry was once defined by the cola commercials and the taste tests, the modern battlefield is far more complex — a competition spanning global market share, diversified portfolios, strategic agility and shareholder value.At first glance, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo may seem like mirror images: both are massive, globally recognized brands with deep roots in American culture and omnipresent product lines. But dig deeper, and you will find two fundamentally different companies. Coca-Cola is a beverage purist, focused solely on liquid refreshment, while PepsiCo has evolved into a diversified powerhouse, balancing beverages with an empire of snacks and packaged foods. Their strategic paths, investment philosophies and long-term visions diverge — and it is this divergence that makes the comparison so compelling for investors.This face-off is not just about which brand tastes better; it is about which business performs better. From market share and financial strength to innovation and sustainability, we will break down how each company stacks up in the real metrics — business strategy, revenue performance, portfolio depth, stock valuation and long-term potential.Whether you are a fan of fizz or a believer in balance, the data may surprise you. Let us step into the ring and see who really has the edge.\nCoca-Cola has long been the undisputed king of the global beverage industry — a brand so iconic that it is often the first name that comes to mind when people think of soft drinks. Commanding a 43% share of the global carbonated soft drink (CSD) market, Coca-Cola has maintained its dominance by staying laser-focused on one thing — beverages. This singular focus has allowed the company to build a powerhouse portfolio of more than 500 beverage brands, ranging from the legendary Coca-Cola Classic to innovations like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Smartwater, and its growing investments in coffee and energy drinks.What sets KO apart is its asset-light franchise model, in which it owns the brands and marketing muscle while outsourcing bottling and distribution to strategic partners. This model delivers high operating margins, scalability and a strong free cash flow — key ingredients for its long-standing reputation as a dividend aristocrat. The company currently yields a steady dividend of around 3%, backed by resilient cash flows even in volatile markets.Strategically, Coca-Cola has been pivoting from sugary sodas to healthier, functional and premium offerings. From acquiring Costa Coffee to expanding Fairlife’s high-protein dairy products, Coca-Cola is reimagining itself as a broader wellness beverage company. KO is also doubling down on emerging markets, where per-capita consumption is still relatively low but rapidly rising, creating a significant long-term growth opportunity.In a world of growing health consciousness, Coca-Cola is working hard to future-proof its brand by focusing on low and no-sugar alternatives, innovative packaging, and digital transformation through data analytics and AI-driven marketing. Its long-term goals are grounded in sustainability — achieving 100% recyclable packaging by 2030 and becoming water-neutral, which resonates with the next generation of socially conscious consumers.For investors, Coca-Cola offers a compelling blend of stability and slow-burning global growth. Its strong brand equity, disciplined capital strategy and exposure to high-growth regions make it a resilient pick for long-term portfolios, especially for those seeking reliable income and a defensive play in uncertain economic times.\nPEP may have started as KO’s feisty challenger in the cola wars, but it has evolved into something far more diversified and resilient. With a beverage market share of around 25%, PepsiCo might not match Coca-Cola’s dominance in CSDs.However, PEP outpaces KO in overall portfolio strength, thanks to its snacking and convenient food business, worth more than $40 billion, which includes iconic brands like Lay’s, Doritos, Quaker and Cheetos. In fact, more than half of PepsiCo’s revenues comes from snacks and foods, giving the company a two-pronged strategy that provides a buffer against beverage market volatility and allows it to ride consumer trends across categories.PepsiCo’s real strength lies in its balanced and adaptable business strategy. While Coca-Cola is doubling down on drinks, PEP is spreading its bets across consumer tastes and winning. It continues to invest heavily in healthier snacks, plant-based options and better-for-you products. At the same time, PEP is innovating in beverages through products like Bubly sparkling water and zero-sugar Gatorade, and leveraging its acquisition of SodaStream to expand into at-home consumption trends.Unlike Coca-Cola’s leaner operating model, PepsiCo is vertically integrated, with more direct control over manufacturing, distribution and retail execution. While this results in slightly lower margins, it gives the company superior agility and execution capabilities, especially in emerging markets, wherein localized supply chains are key to success. The company’s emphasis on digital transformation, AI-powered demand forecasting, and personalized marketing also puts it ahead of the curve in leveraging technology for growth.Looking forward, PepsiCo has bold ambitions; it plans to be net-zero by 2040. It is also heavily investing in regenerative agriculture and continues to expand its global snacking footprint, particularly in high-growth markets across Asia, Latin America and Africa. The company’s \"PepsiCo Positive\" sustainability initiative ties profitability to purpose — a strategic alignment that increasingly matters to institutional investors and ESG-focused funds.\nShares of PepsiCo show a declining trend in the year-to-date period due to the ongoing challenges related to subdued category demand in its convenient food business and the impacts of a product recall in the QFNA segment. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola shares have demonstrated steady growth in the past year, driven by resilient business trends. Year to date, PepsiCo shares have declined 6%, whereas Coca-Cola stock has rallied 15.5%.\n \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n \nFrom a valuation standpoint, PEP currently trades at a lower forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 17X compared with Coca-Cola’s 23.8X, making it more attractively priced, driven by its earnings and diversified revenue stream.\n \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n \nThe PEP stock looks cheap from a valuation perspective. Moreover, its diversity, pricing power and innovation engine make it a compelling long-term holding, especially for those seeking both growth and downside protection.Coca-Cola does seem pricey. However, its valuations reflect its strong brand equity, disciplined capital strategy and exposure to high-growth regions, making it a resilient pick for long-term portfolios. If the company sustains its execution, the premium could be warranted.\nPepsiCo’s EPS estimates for 2025 and 2026 moved down 0.2% each in the last 30 days. PEP’s 2025 revenues are projected to decline 0.2% year over year to $91.7 billion, and EPS is expected to ascent 1.4% year over year to $8.27.\n \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n \nCoca-Cola’s EPS estimates for 2025 have been unchanged in the past 30 days, while the consensus estimates for 2026 moved down by a penny in the same period. KO’s 2025 revenues and EPS are expected to increase 2% and 2.8% year over year, respectively, to $48 billion and $2.96 per share.\n \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor investors seeking a blend of reliability and global reach, Coca-Cola offers a compelling case. As the undisputed leader in the beverage industry, the company’s streamlined, high-margin model and world-class brand portfolio offer a foundation for stability, resilience and predictable income.KO continues to evolve, introducing healthier, low-sugar alternatives and expanding its footprint in high-growth emerging markets, reinforcing its relevance in a shifting consumer landscape. However, its lofty valuation could be a hurdle for value-oriented investors seeking more compelling entry points or diversified growth exposure.Conversely, PepsiCo is the quintessential all-weather investment. Its diverse mix of beverages and snacks provides a natural hedge against category-specific headwinds, offering exposure to multiple growth levers. While the company is currently navigating shifts in consumer behavior, PepsiCo’s ability to innovate and localize its offerings across global markets positions it for sustained, long-term growth.PEP’s discounted valuation, balanced business exposure and broader growth potential give it a slight edge over Coca-Cola. With solid fundamentals and a discounted valuation, PepsiCo currently presents a more dynamic investment opportunity, particularly for those seeking a mix of defensive strength and forward-looking growth.Both KO and PEP currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), reflecting a neutral outlook — but beneath the surface, their strategic differences tell two distinct investment stories.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other best dividend monarchs.\nDividend-focused investors are generally well-acquainted with terms like Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Kings, but many may not be aware of a lesser-known group called Dividend Monarchs. While they fall under the broader category of dividend growth stocks, they carry a distinct title. The Dividend Monarchs Index highlights US companies that have managed to raise their dividends consistently for at least 50 consecutive years. These firms have weathered decades of market ups and downs, showcasing both resilience and steady performance in terms of dividend growth and stock returns. As an evolution of the well-known S&P Dividend Aristocrats Index Series, the S&P Dividend Monarchs Index sets an even higher standard, recognizing a more exclusive tier of long-term dividend payers.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices has been a pioneer in dividend growth strategies since the 1980s, initially tracking US companies with at least 10 years of dividend increases. As the number of such companies grew, the threshold was raised to 25 years, forming the basis for the Dividend Aristocrats Index, launched in 2005. This index became a widely recognized benchmark, eventually expanding to include mid- and small-cap stocks as well as global markets. By April 2023, over $40 billion in ETF assets tracked these indices. With a rising number of companies now surpassing 50 consecutive years of dividend growth across different market caps, S&P introduced the Dividend Monarchs Index in 2023 to reflect this new elite group.\nThe key distinction between Dividend Kings and Dividend Monarchs lies in the inclusion criteria. While both require at least 50 consecutive years of dividend increases, Dividend Monarchs must also meet specific standards set by S&P. To qualify for the Dividend Monarchs Index, a company must be part of the Composite 1500, have a float-adjusted market capitalization of at least $2 billion, maintain a three-month average daily trading value of $5 million or more, and consistently grow its dividend over five decades. This added layer of eligibility makes Monarchs a more selective, index-based group.\nCompanies that meet the tough 50-year dividend growth requirement tend to show strong profitability and financial stability. According to an S&P Dow Jones Indices report dated April 30, 2023, the Dividend Monarchs Index outperformed both the broader market and the S&P Composite in terms of return on equity (ROE) and showed more consistent earnings. The report also noted that, based on back-tested data since January 31, 2018, the Dividend Monarchs Index displayed more defensive traits—offering lower volatility and smaller drawdowns than the S&P 500 during market declines.\nAlthough the Dividend Monarchs Index is a relatively new concept with only five years of back-tested performance, it has grown significantly during that time, expanding from 11 to 35 constituents. Despite the index’s short history, the companies included have a track record of at least 50 consecutive years of dividend growth, dating as far back as 1972. According to data presented by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the performance of these companies—measured through both price returns over the past 50 years and total returns since December 1989—has generally outpaced that of the broader market. This suggests that many of the index’s constituents have delivered stronger long-term results. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best Dividend Monarchs to invest in.\nA row of factory workers assembling bottles of sparkling soft drinks on a conveyor belt.\nFor this list, we scanned the holdings of the S&P Dividend Monarchs Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 50 consecutive years of dividend growth. From that list, we picked 10 stocks that were most popular among hedge funds, as per Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the hedge funds having stakes in them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\nWarren Buffett’s favorite, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a multinational beverage company that offers a wide range of products. The company has traditionally held up well during economic downturns. A large share of its yearly revenue comes from selling concentrate syrup for its signature beverages—a business model that requires relatively little capital investment yet delivers strong profitability. Over the past five years, the company has consistently maintained profit margins above 20%, underscoring the strength and efficiency of its operations.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) reported revenue of $11.5 billion, marking a 6.5% increase compared to the same period last year. Organic revenue rose by 14%, driven by a 9% boost in pricing and mix, along with a 5% uptick in concentrate sales. The company gained ground across its beverage categories, with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar showing notable growth—unit volume jumped 13% during the quarter. Its continued success was also supported by creative marketing efforts, which have added roughly $40 billion in retail sales to the flagship brand over the past three years.\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) maintained solid cash generation, producing $2.9 billion in operating cash flow and $1.6 billion in free cash flow. The quarter also saw an adjusted operating margin of 30.7%, highlighting the company’s strong profitability. It announced a 5.2% hike in its quarterly dividend in February to $0.51 per share, which was the company’s 63rd consecutive year of dividend growth. The stock supports a dividend yield of 2.84%, as of April 15.\nOverall, KO ranks 3rd on our list of the best Dividend Monarchs to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of KO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than KO but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

Here's a look at why dividend investors like Realty Income and why there's another net lease REIT that may be a better choice today.  What does Realty Income do?\nMany growth-focused companies don't pay dividends at all, which is why the yield on the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has fallen to just 1.4%.  Stocks with reliable dividends and high yields can be excellent ways to collect passive income no matter what the broader market is doing.  Here's why these three fool.com contributors think Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE: BEP) (NYSE: BEPC), and MSC Industrial Direct (NYSE: MSM) are three high-yield dividend stocks to buy now.\nThe stock market has slumped sharply this year due to concerns that tariffs could cause a recession.  One positive from the sell-off is that lower stock prices cause dividend yields to rise.  Because of that, investors can lock in dividend yields of 5% or more on some high-quality companies right now.\nToronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD) has a 5% dividend yield.

Given the prevailing market uncertainty, you may want to look at our feats to prepare better for your next action.\nHere are some of our key achievements:\nShares of Palomar Holdings, Inc. PLMR have gained 16.5% (versus the S&P 500’s 12.4% decrease) since it was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on February 18.\nAnother stock, Heineken N.V. HEINY, which was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) also on February 18, has returned 2.4% since then.\nA hypothetical portfolio of Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy) stocks returned -3.48% in January 2025 (through February 3rd) vs. -0.60% for the S&P 500 index and -2.75% for the equal-weight version of the index\nThis portfolio returned +22.3% in 2024, vs. +28% for the S&P 500 index and +19.9% for the equal-weight version of the S&P 500 index. \nThis hypothetical portfolio returned +20.63% in 2023 vs. +24.83% for the S&P 500 index and +15% for the equal-weight S&P 500 index. \nThe portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 stocks is an equal-weight portfolio, while the S&P 500 index is a market-cap-weighted index that has been notably distorted by the concentrated performance of mega-cap stocks since late 2022. \nThe Zacks Model Portfolio - consisting of Zacks Rank #1 stocks – has outperformed the S&P index by almost 13 percentage points since 1988 (through the end of January 2025, the Zacks # 1 Rank stocks generated an annualized average return of +23.9% since 1988 vs. +11.3% for the S&P 500 index).\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here >>>\nCheck Palomar’s historical EPS and Sales here>>>\nCheck Heineken’s historical EPS and Sales here>>>\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nShares of Munchener Ruckversicherungs MURGY and Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. SFM have advanced 11.7% (versus the S&P 500’s 10.1% fall) and 9.7% (versus the S&P 500’s 10.9% fall) since their Zacks Recommendation was upgraded to Outperform on February 27 and February 24, respectively.\nWhile the Zacks Rank is our short-term rating system that is most effective over the one- to three-month holding horizon, the Zacks Recommendation aims to predict performance over the next 6 to 12 months. However, just like the Zacks Rank, the foundation for the Zacks Recommendation is trends in earnings estimate revisions.\nThe Zacks Recommendation classifies stocks into three groups — Outperform, Neutral and Underperform. While these recommendations are determined quantitatively, our analysts have the flexibility to override them for the 1100+ stocks they closely follow based on their better judgment of factors such as valuation, industry conditions and management effectiveness than the quantitative model.\nTo access our research reports with Zacks Recommendations for the 1100+ stocks we cover, click here>>>\nShares of Casey's General Stores, Inc. CASY, which belongs to the Zacks Focus List, have gained 15.8% over the past 12 weeks. The stock was added to the Focus List on August 20, 2019. Another Focus-List holding, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, which was added to the portfolio on June 22, 2015, has returned 10.3% over the past 12 weeks. The S&P 500 has declined 8.2% over this period.\nThe Focus List portfolio returned -2.96% in the first quarter of 2025 vs. -4.30% for the S&P 500 index and -0.61% for the equal-weight version of the index. \nThe 50-stock Zacks Focus List portfolio returned +18.41% in 2024 vs. +25.04% for the S&P 500 index and +13% for the equal-weight S&P 500 index.

Let’s take a look at how Arcos Dorados (NYSE:ARCO) and the rest of the traditional fast food stocks fared in Q4.\nTraditional fast-food restaurants are renowned for their speed and convenience, boasting menus filled with familiar and budget-friendly items. Their reputations for on-the-go consumption make them favored destinations for individuals and families needing a quick meal. This class of restaurants, however, is fighting the perception that their meals are unhealthy and made with inferior ingredients, a battle that's especially relevant today given the consumers increasing focus on health and wellness.\nThe 14 traditional fast food stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q4. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts’ consensus estimates.\nAmidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 11.2% since the latest earnings results.\nTranslating to “Golden Arches” in Spanish, Arcos Dorados (NYSE:ARCO) is the master franchisee of the McDonald's brand in Latin America and the Caribbean, responsible for its operations and growth in over 20 countries.\nArcos Dorados reported revenues of $1.14 billion, down 2.7% year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 2.7%, but it was still a strong quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates and an impressive beat of analysts’ same-store sales estimates.\nArcos Dorados delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates of the whole group.

It was a disappointing quarter as it posted full-year revenue guidance missing analysts’ expectations.\nKrispy Kreme delivered the slowest revenue growth and weakest full-year guidance update in the group. As expected, the stock is down 52.9% since the results and currently trades at $4.30.\nRead our full analysis of Krispy Kreme’s results here. \nWith nicknames spanning Mickey D's in the U.S. to Makku in Japan, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is a fast-food behemoth known for its convenience and broken ice cream machines.\nMcDonald's reported revenues of $6.39 billion, flat year on year.

Despite higher borrowing costs, the economy has avoided flashing recessionary signals. This is the much-desired soft landing that many investors hoped for. The recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November 2024) have bolstered the stock market, making 2024 a strong year for equities. Donald Trump’s presidential win in November sparked additional market gains, sending indices to record highs in the days following his victory. However, debates continue over possible tariffs and corporate tax adjustments, raising questions about economic stability in 2025.\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

            "content": "Title: Chili’s trolls McDonald’s with its new quarter pounder burger\nDate: 2025-04-15 13:00\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/food/chilis-mcdonalds-qb-burger?.tsrc=rss\nContent:\nMarkets \n\n\n\nHot Stocks \n\n\n\nFear & Greed Index \n\n\n\n\n            Latest Market News \n\n\n\n\n            Hot Stocks \n\n\n\nFollow:\n\n            Chili’s is ratcheting up its fight against fast food rivals with a new cheeseburger that might make McDonald’s call their lawyers.\n    \n\n            The chain is rolling out Tuesday the Big QP burger, which not only has a similar name to McDonald’s Quarter Pounder but also the same toppings: two slices of American cheese, pickles, ketchup and diced onions. Chili’s says in a press release that its version has 85% more beef, making it “even more value-packed” than the fast food classic.\n    \n\n            The Big QP is being added to Chili’s popular “3 for Me,” a $10.99 meal that includes the burger, fries, unlimited chips and free refills of a soft drink. The deal exploded in popularity last year when Chili’s took aim at customers of its fast food rivals (notably McDonald’s)  who might be turned off by their rising prices.\n    \n\n            And while the meal might be more expensive than a McDonald’s Quarter Pounder, which costs around $5 to $7 depending on the city, it’s comparable in price to a combo meal with medium fries and medium-sized soft drink.\n    \n\n            Chili’s directly jabbed McDonald’s in its press release, calling the $10.99 deal “less expensive than a comparable meal at McDonald’s” as well as releasing TV ads that call the Quarter Pounder “tiny.”\n    \n\n            The Big QP is the second McDonald’s-inspired burger from Chili’s. Last year, the chain added a Big Mac-like burger called the Big Smasher, rolling out a cheeky ad campaign that directly called out the Big Mac. Ultimately, that proved a successful gambit, with the Big Smasher helping Chili’s register a 15% jump in same-store sales following its release.\n    \n\n            Chili’s is likely hoping to sustain its skyrocketing sales by continuing this rivalry. Sales in its most recent quarter jumped 31%, marking the chain’s third-straight quarter of double-digit growth. Shares of Brinker International (EAT), its parent company, have soared 200% over the past year.\n    \n\nRelated article\nChili’s and Applebee’s are fighting about their value meals\n\n\n            Once trailing flashier rivals, Chili’s is pulling off its comeback thanks to these deals, plus revamped chicken tender recipes and viral TikToks of its “Triple Dipper” appetizer. The chain also recently opened a location in Scranton, Pennsylvania inspired by “The Office.”\n\n\n            This success stands in contrast to most casual dining chains. Typically catering to lower and middle-income families looking for a sit-down meal, diners have been abandoning these companies in recent years. These restaurants have been hiking menu prices at the same time their customer base is being squeezed by the rising cost of living, resulting in several bankruptcies, including Hooters, TGI Fridays and Buca di Beppo.\n    \n\n            Although McDonald’s hasn’t directly responded to Chili’s, the chain recently added a “McValue” menu category in hopes of turning around its sluggish sales. In addition to the $5 meal deal, the menu also has a “Buy One, Add One for $1” option and more locally targeted promotions from its franchises.\n    \nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

On Monday, the stock’s closing price of $316.07 was above its 50-day moving average of $305.19 and the 200-day moving average of $288.64.Despite the market volatility and cautious sentiment due to macroeconomic uncertainty, including tariff concerns and potential recession risks, investors have been optimistic about McDonald's. The company has been gaining from internal efforts focused on its Accelerating the Arches plan, introducing menu items, offering better value deals and expanding its presence across the global markets.\n \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n \nOver the past three months, MCD shares have gained 13% compared the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry’s 0.6% rise. Over the same period, the stock has fared better than the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s 6.9% dip and the S&P 500 index’s 9.3% decline.\n \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n \nThe MCD stock has outperformed some industry players in the past three months, including Restaurant Brands International Inc. QSR, The Wendy's Company WEN and Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG. In the said time frame, shares of Restaurant Brands have gained 4.2%, while Wendy's and Chipotle have tumbled 12.6% and 14%, respectively.Can McDonald's recent performance signal a continued upward trajectory? Let us explore the key factors that can drive the stock's growth and strengthen investor confidence in the near term.\nMCD is focused on expanding its global presence, aiming to enhance growth through the latest openings and upgrades to existing locations. This strategy supports the company’s continued performance despite challenging conditions. In 2024, McDonald's opened 2,116 restaurants, an increase from 2,067 in 2023. This growth reflects the company’s focus on expanding its global footprint through the Restaurant Development pillar of its Accelerating the Arches Strategy.Going forward, McDonald's aims to accelerate its pace of restaurant openings to meet growing demand across key markets. In 2025, the company plans to open 2,200 restaurants globally, contributing more than 4% to new unit growth, net of closures. It continues to build on its industry-leading development, targeting 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027, marking the fastest growth phase in its history.\nMcDonald's continues to strengthen its brand by enhancing core menu offerings and improving customer experience. With a focus on value, variety and operational efficiency, the company is working to boost customer engagement and drive long-term growth. In January 2025, MCD launched the McValue platform in the United States, designed to provide customers with more flexible options and consistent value.MCD is enhancing its delivery services to provide greater convenience and improve the customer experience. With an emphasis on expanding delivery options and strengthening digital capabilities, the company is focused on creating seamless ways for customers to access its offerings.Over the past year, the delivery sales mix has doubled in Australia, Canada and the United States. McDonald's expects to increase the percentage of system-wide delivery sales originating from its mobile app to 30% by 2027.\nMcDonald's is leveraging its loyalty program and digital initiatives to drive customer retention and expand its base. By enhancing the customer experience across multiple channels, the company is creating more value for loyalty members and increasing engagement through innovative digital solutions.Since launching its loyalty program, MCD has seen significant growth, with more than 170 million 90-day active users. In 2024, sales to loyalty members reached $30 billion. With the continued rise in digital adoption, McDonald's is optimistic about the long-term success of its loyalty program. The company expects to expand its active user base to 250 million and achieve $45 billion in annual sales by 2027.\n \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n \nAnalysts are becoming more optimistic about MCD’s earnings outlook. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for McDonald's 2025 EPS has increased from $12.23 to $12.25, implying a 4.5% year-over-year increase. The momentum is set to continue into 2026, with earnings anticipated to climb 8.2% year over year to $13.25 per share.\nMcDonald's is currently valued at a premium compared with its industry on a forward 12-month price-to-earnings basis. The company’s forward 12-month P/E ratio stands at 25.21X, slightly higher than the industry’s average of 25.12X. The premium valuation reflects the company’s consistent performance, strong position in key markets and earnings growth potential. Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands, Wendy's and Chipotle are trading at P/E ratios of 16.61X, 12.83X, and 36.81X, respectively.\n \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGiven MCD's strong global expansion strategy, focus on menu innovation and digital initiatives, the company is well-positioned for continued growth. Restaurant openings, digital enhancements and the successful loyalty program show promising long-term prospects.However, the company is facing challenges with weaker comparable store sales growth, as global comps edged down 0.1% in 2024 against 9% growth in the prior year. Additionally, macroeconomic uncertainty and market volatility could weigh on short-term performance.Considering McDonald's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), investors may want to stay cautious while monitoring the company's ability to capitalize on its growth opportunities in the coming quarters.

CMG stock's premium valuation — trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 36.81X — has raised eyebrows, especially as the restaurant industry braces for potential disruption from renewed trade tensions and tariff threats. The stock is trading above the Zacks Retail-Restaurant industry’s average of 25.12X and the broader Retail-Wholesale sector’s 22.11X.The warning signals come as restaurant chains, including peers like Brinker International, Inc. EAT, McDonald's Corporation MCD and Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM face dual threats: slowing discretionary spending and geopolitical risk. Looming macroeconomic risks, concerns around inflation, retaliatory tariffs, and rising labor costs are beginning to cast a shadow over CMG’s near-term prospects.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSo far this year, shares of Chipotle have declined 18.1% compared with the Zacks Retail – Restaurants industry’s fall of 1.5%. The stock has underperformed the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s and the S&P 500’s declines of 5.7% and 8.4%, respectively.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a technical perspective, Chipotle stock is currently trading below its 50-day moving average, signaling a bearish trend.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAnalysts and investors alike are starting to question how sustainable Chipotle’s momentum is under these conditions. Let’s find out.\nMacro Pressures Are Building: The broader economic environment is starting to catch up with even the most resilient players. Inflation remains sticky, interest rates are still elevated, and consumers are becoming more price-conscious. As a premium fast-casual brand, Chipotle is particularly vulnerable to this shift.Declining profitability remains a concern for CMG. During the fourth quarter of 2024, Restaurant-level margins contracted 60 basis points year over year to 24.8%, weighed down by rising input costs and portion-related investments. Despite promises of back-half relief from initiatives like produce slicers and back-of-house modernization, management expects margin pressure to linger into the first half of 2025.While many restaurant chains are seeing signs of consumer trade-down behavior, Chipotle has continued to raise menu prices to offset inflationary pressures. This strategy worked well during earlier waves of inflation, but there are signs that consumer tolerance for higher prices may be peaking. The brand's value perception is at risk, especially as grocery inflation moderates and home cooking becomes a more attractive alternative for budget-minded customers.\nTariff Troubles on the Horizon: Chipotle may also find itself caught in the crosshairs of geopolitical trade friction. With about 2% of Chipotle’s product cost tied to imports from Mexico — including avocados, tomatoes and peppers — the newly announced tariffs could shave an additional 60 basis points off margins if implemented fully. While management has done commendable work diversifying suppliers, the risk remains non-trivial. A spike in input costs could pressure margins and force further price hikes, which may not be well received by customers already feeling the pinch.Other major chains like Brinker, YUM! Brands and McDonald's have acknowledged the potential impact of tariffs, suggesting broader industry-wide implications. Chipotle, despite its nimbleness, is not immune to these macro-level risks.\nChipotle’s 2025 earnings per share (EPS) estimates have been revised downward, dropping from $1.29 to $1.27 over the past 60 days. This downward trend reflects weakening analyst confidence in the stock’s near-term prospects.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNevertheless, the company is likely to report strong earnings, with projections indicating 13.4% year-over-year growth in 2025. Conversely, industry players like Brinker, YUM! Brands and McDonald's are likely to witness a rise of 102.7%, 9.3% and 4.5%, year over year, respectively.\nDespite the concerns, Chipotle is not without its strengths. The company continues to set itself apart by focusing on high-quality, customizable food served quickly in a clean and consistent environment. As part of its broader strategy, Chipotle is doubling down on speed and service through operational upgrades and managerial stability, which are helping drive strong customer loyalty and higher transaction volumes.To further elevate the customer experience, Chipotle has made significant investments in digital innovation and restaurant design. With digital orders now accounting for more than a third of its sales, the company’s mobile app and “Chipotlane” drive-thru pickup windows are creating faster, more convenient ways for customers to engage with the brand. These enhancements not only increase average check sizes but also boost efficiency, contributing to stronger unit economics and improving throughput during peak hours.On the sourcing side, Chipotle has taken early steps to mitigate tariff risk by diversifying avocado suppliers beyond Mexico. While not a full hedge, it does reduce exposure relative to less-prepared peers. Additionally, the brand’s focus on automation and kitchen innovation could help offset wage inflation and maintain unit economics.Chipotle is also positioning itself for global expansion, with promising early traction in Canada, Europe, and the Middle East. By tailoring its strategy for international markets while maintaining its core values, the company is showing that its model can travel. Domestically, it continues to pursue its goal of reaching 7,000 locations, backed by strong unit economics and growing average unit volumes. Together, these efforts are positioning Chipotle for long-term margin expansion and sustainable growth.\nAnalysts maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook on Chipotle’s stock. Based on short-term price targets from 31 analysts, the average price target is $64.84, suggesting a potential upside of 31.1% from the last closing price of $49.46. Price forecasts range from a low of $48.00, indicating a 2.95% downside risk, to a high of $72.00, which represents a possible 45.6% upside. Meanwhile, Chipotle carries a solid average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.52 on a scale of 1 (Strong Buy) to 5 (Strong Sell), reflecting a favorable consensus. Among 32 brokerage firms, 22 analysts rate the stock as a Strong Buy and three as a Buy, underscoring confidence in Chipotle’s growth potential.\nChipotle remains a strong brand within the fast-casual dining space, backed by its commitment to food quality, digital innovation, and long-term expansion plans. Despite current macroeconomic pressures, including inflation, rising labor costs, and looming tariff threats, the company’s proactive steps — such as supplier diversification, automation, and a focus on customer experience — highlight its operational agility and long-term vision. Continued digital investment and international expansion further strengthen its position for future growth.\nThat said, Chipotle’s elevated valuation and recent underperformance relative to its industry and broader market introduce caution into the near-term outlook. Margin pressure, waning consumer tolerance for price hikes and geopolitical uncertainties could weigh on earnings and sentiment in the coming quarters. The stock’s downward earnings estimate revisions and technical weakness add to investment hesitancy.\nGiven these dynamics, existing investors may consider holding on to this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock as Chipotle works through short-term headwinds and executes its strategic initiatives. However, new investors might find it wise to remain on the sidelines until macro risks moderate and momentum begins to recover, especially considering the stock’s premium valuation and recent volatility.\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO) stands against other top restaurant stocks to buy under $20.\nRestaurant stocks are showing volatility amid Trump’s tariff impositions across various sectors. On April 7, CNBC reported that while US stocks are tumbling due to the effects of high tariffs on the import of goods from key trading partners, analysts do not anticipate the tariffs to hit most restaurant stocks directly. However, inflation is expected to follow behind, fueled by expert and investor fear of an impending recession. This may put pressure on the spending capacity of consumers, resulting in an economic downturn.\nCNBC reported that UBS analyst Dennis Geiger said the following in a note to clients:\n“We view the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants as manageable, with a focus on select commodity costs, but see the bigger risk as incremental pressure on consumer spending and industry demand.”\nCNBC also reported that investor concerns affected restaurant stocks across all sectors. Fast food restaurant chains have historically shown the most resilience during recessions, as consumers looking for cheap dining options typically level down from fast-casual or full-service diners and eateries to fast food options. However, the drop in consumer spending witnessed last year saw fast food restaurants hit hard, as low-income consumers cut their spending to this sector, visiting them less frequently. High-income consumers, on the other hand, continued with their usual dining habits, creating a gap that negatively affected fast food companies. Quick-service restaurants thus underwent same-store sales declines.\nOn March 8, Mario Carbone, Major Food Group chef and co-founder, appeared on CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ to discuss the effects of Trump’s tariffs on the food industry and how high-end consumers are behaving in the sector. Talking about New York, he said that the numbers are booming, going above their pre-Covid benchmarks. New York is thus telling us that everything is good, and there is no fear right now in dining in the luxury sector. Stats are up, and restaurants are packed, with consumer energy through the roof. As of right now, there are no signs of slowing at all if one evaluates the spending and trends in restaurant reports.\nHowever, Carbone said that inflation hits the food and restaurant industry just like everyone else. The luxury food sector is responsible to the customer for bringing in the best ingredients for every meal, which is why it has no choice but to pass the effects on to the consumer in case such trends materialize.\nWe sifted through stock screeners, financial media reports, and ETFs to compile a list of 20 restaurant stocks under $20 as of April 13, 2025, and chose the top 10 most popular among hedge funds as of Q4 2024. The list is ordered in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey’s database.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of customers ordering from a McDonald's restaurant in Latin America.\nShare Price: $7.22\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21\nArcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO) is a McDonald’s franchisee operating or franchising more than 2,140 McDonald’s-branded restaurants. Its operations are divided into four geographical categories: Brazil, the Carribean, the North Latin America division (NOLAD), and the South Latin America division (SLAD).\nAnalysts believe that Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc.’s (NYSE:ARCO) stock provides an attractive entry point. The company holds a competitive market edge due to its restaurant portfolio. More than half of its restaurants are free-standing units, which provide a mix of takeout, drive-thru, and delivery service options and boost restaurant sales.\nOn October 1, 2024, the company announced that it would exercise its option to renew its Master Franchise Agreement (MFA) with McDonald’s for another 20 years starting in 2025. This agreement has strengthened the company’s strategic footing, which stems from the geographic diversification of its solid restaurant base throughout Latin America.\nOn April 1, BTG Pactual initiated coverage of Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO) with a Buy rating and a $10.50 price target. Analysts have bullish sentiments for the stock, and their median price target of $7.22 implies an upside of 45.43% from current levels.\nBrennan Asset Management stated the following regarding Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n“Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO): Rough 2024…Shares Substantially Undervalued: ARCO produced solid operating results throughout 2024, but negative currency movements, including a near freefall in the Brazilian Real (over 20 percent decline), drove investors to dump ARCO shares. As we noted in our Q3 letter, ARCO announced that it renewed its master franchise agreement (MFA) with McDonald’s (MCD) at terms that were better than many anticipated. While we won’t rehash the entire ARCO thesis (see our 2023 Q2 and Q3 letters for more color), we continue to believe that ARCO is a unique asset (the license to operate essentially all MCD restaurants from Mexico south) that was turbocharged by COVID’s aftereffects. During and after COVID, a large percentage of restaurants closed and there was rapid adoption of drive-through and delivery sales. ARCO disproportionately benefited, given its larger share of free-standing stores. ARCO has a strong balance sheet (including substantial real-estate value), strong incremental returns on capital and a substantial growth opportunity. Brazil faces macro challenges, and further currency weakness is distinctly possible. That said, ARCO has a history of achieving same[1]store sale growth above inflation rates and Brazil has some of the highest delivery penetration rates and digital adaptation rates in all of LATAM. Furthermore, there is no reason for ARCO not to move its listing from New York to Sao Paulo and greatly neutralize the reporting impact from currency fluctuations. We strongly believe ARCO is mispriced at current levels.”\nOverall, ARCO ranks 6th on our list of the top restaurant stocks to buy under $20. While we acknowledge the potential for ARCO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML (ASML) slid as much as 7.6%. The selloff in semiconductor stocks over the past three months has already wiped out about $2 trillion in market capitalization.\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration has barred Nvidia from selling its H20 chip in China, an escalation of Washington’s tech battle with Beijing. ASML later added to investor anxiety by posting orders that missed expectations and saying that it doesn’t know how to quantify the impact of recent tariff announcements.\nThe latest developments show how tariffs are already wreaking havoc on global companies, while the trade war is extending beyond mere import taxes as well. The fallout could weigh on chip-sector earnings and also set back China’s ambitions to compete on the global tech stage. ASML’s drop weighed on Europe’s technology sector, with losses across chip equipment peers pushing the Stoxx 600 Technology Index about 2.5% lower.\nThe H20 restrictions are “driven by concerns over China’s rise in the electronics sector, and in that sense, it is likely to become a permanent policy,” said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management. “It is expected to have a significant negative impact on semiconductor supply chain.”\nTrump’s war on trade is prompting economists to scale back their forecasts for GDP growth worldwide, casting doubt over the outlook for everything from smart-phone demand to computing. Even before Washington slapped additional tariffs on much of the world — only to roll them back shortly after — many industry analysts had questioned whether big tech firms from Microsoft Corp. to Meta Platforms Inc. will continue to buy Nvidia Corp. chips at the same pace in 2025.\nAmong key suppliers, Korean memory maker SK Hynix Inc. slumped 3.7% Wednesday. Top foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 2.5% ahead of results on Thursday. Japanese chip-equipment maker Advantest Corp. (6857.T) dropped 6.6%, extending its fall after ASML’s statement.\nTSMC was already likely to slow some production expansion on a weaker economic outlook, and “the tighter rules on Nvidia’s China sales might amplify the deceleration,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Ken Hui wrote in a note.\nFor China, the broader restrictions raise concerns that access to global tech hardware will be further choked off. Exports of the most-advanced chips and equipment to the Asian nation are already banned, and the H20 is a scaled-down product specifically designed not to be too powerful.\nEven after DeepSeek raised hopes that advances can be made in artificial intelligence and other fields without the most cutting-edge chips, China’s tech giants may suffer if curbs keep getting extended. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA, 9988.HK) sank as much as 5.4% in Hong Kong trading Wednesday, while Baidu Inc. (BIDU) fell 3.3%.\n“It is a reminder of the potential susceptibility of tech stocks to the ongoing prickly relationship between the US and China regarding semiconductors,” said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade in Sydney. “There is a reliance on the H20 chip from big name players in the Asian tech space, so any moves which could impact supply will be a drag on the broader sector.”\nOn the other side of the equation, China continues to work toward self-reliance in technology, though its companies are still seen lagging far behind advanced global leaders like Nvidia.\nAmong Chinese hardware stocks bucking the regional sector declines Wednesday, Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd. jumped as much as 6.6% in Hong Kong while Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc. rose 2.1% in Shanghai.\n“AI innovation in China is booming and the H20 ban would not dampen it — it may accelerate the use of China domestic chips,” said Vey-Sern Ling, a managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. “Domestic AI chips may not perform as well as Nvidia’s H20, but that is missing the point. China has been able to develop innovative AI models despite US restrictions.”\n—With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi, Kit Rees, Edwin Chan, Henry Ren and Kurt Schussler.\n(Adds market value data in first and second paragraphs, US premarket trading in second)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's \n                        \n                            Terms\n                        \n                     and \n                        \n                            Privacy Policy\n                        \n\nJ&J faces several headwinds at the start of the year, including patent expiry, talc litigation, and, now, tariffs.\nTariffs put the U.S. at a short-term disadvantage and will harm competition for North American automakers once Chinese automakers arrive, Lawler said.\nNvidia was rising Tuesday after President Donald Trump said the chip maker's U.S. infrastructure permits would be expedited.\nSellers took center stage early Wednesday as news of a possible China trade barrier for Nvidia put a chill on tech firms specializing in artificial intelligence, and the markets in general.\nWith President Donald Trump announcing a wide set of tariffs, there could be increased costs for a range of companies.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes.\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer reacted to the partial tariff exemptions announced by the White House, interpreting them not as a full retreat, but as a strategic pause designed to avoid punishing American companies. He suggested the administration was being careful not to hand over competitive advantages to Southeast Asian rivals, particularly Samsung:\n“So what I saw today, and not to be facetious, but what I see is people saying, you know what, we’ve seen the downside. Maybe we can test it again. But the president has, I don’t want to say blink, because that’s nonsense. What the president did was say, OK, look, we’re not going to continue to punish American companies and give the green light to Korea. I don’t know if you heard Lutnick’s words. He was very specific. Southeast Asia. That’s Samsung. They didn’t want to give the ball to Samsung.”\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Hints at a Bigger Agenda Behind Tariffs and Breaks Down These 7 Stocks and Jim Cramer Reacts to the Surprise Market Surge and Highlights 8 Key Stocks.\nTurning to currency dynamics, Cramer pushed back on what he sees as misplaced panic over a weakening U.S. dollar. Instead, he argued that a softer dollar actually benefits American multinationals and gives long-needed relief to CFOs who’ve spent years blaming currency strength for lost market share:\n“Well, look, I’m not so certain I’m going to do a little contrary stuff on the dollar here. When we listen to conference calls, for the last four years, all we hear about is it would have been so much better if the dollar weren’t so strong. We keep losing share, the dollar’s too strong. Suddenly the dollar’s weaker, and now we start hearing all the downside, what, the bonds? I mean, I’m almost thinking that, I’m gonna put this out there, the people who are saying that it’s the end of the world, that the dollar is weaker, I think they have to go do some work boots on the ground. […] So suddenly the dollar’s weaker and we are petrified? These are people who have an agenda. And their agenda is to say, you know what matters more than anything else? Our hegemony from a strong dollar. And I don’t get it. If you’re in our business of picking stocks, you’re sick and tired of hearing CFOs say, we are done. We’ve got to stop this dollar rise.”\nCramer also gave his opinion about the rhetoric coming from Beijing, likening it to the Cold War-era paranoia of the 1960s and ’70s. He questioned whether a diplomatic breakthrough similar to Nixon’s historic visit to China is even possible under the current tone of U.S.-China relations:\n“But when I listen to the rhetoric from China, this is the 1968-72 rhetoric. It’s the kind of rhetoric that just says there’s never going to be a meeting. Is there a way to have a Nixon to China moment? Because as far as I’m concerned, this is just right now you’re on the verge of when I was a little boy and we kept thinking, when are they going to bomb us? I mean, that was the same rhetoric. When are they going to launch their nuclear weapons? I mean, that’s why we used to live in fear. That’s why we had cubbyholes. That’s why we used to put our heads in a cubbyhole, because the Chinese were going to bomb us if the Russians didn’t bomb us. This is the same sound.”\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on April 14th.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund holders: 262\nDiscussing Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s antitrust scrutiny, Cramer took a contrarian view, suggesting that even if the company were forced to break up, it could unlock more shareholder value. He also emphasized WhatsApp’s overlooked strength as a key asset within Meta’s portfolio. Here’s his commentary:\n“I mean, all I know is that you break it up, you make even more money. It’s even better. I was on WhatsApp this weekend, David. That’s worth the price of the company. WhatsApp is a very powerful platform. Yeah, you have to hold it down and then you let it go and you talk into it and it’s just amazing. I’m all over it. Oh, I’m a WhatsApp guy. I have a lot of executives who really just, they come to me on WhatsApp.”\nOverall, META ranks 3rd on our list of key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Meta argues that Zuckerberg's motivations do not matter because it does not have a monopoly.\nSOCIAL MEDIA CHANGING\nThe FTC claims Meta monopolizes the market for social networks where users share with friends and family. A key piece of Meta's defense is that the social media landscape has changed vastly since it bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, and even since the FTC brought the case 5 years ago.\nZuckerberg testified that now around 20% of content on Facebook and 10% on Instagram is generated by users' friends as opposed to accounts they follow based on interests.\n\"People just kept on engaging with more and more stuff that wasn't what their friends were doing,\" he said.\nALL-AD FEED\nPurchasing Instagram diminished competition and let Meta manipulate the service in ways that benefited the company and not users, such as by boosting the number of ads, the FTC argues. More competition would result in better outcomes for users, such as pressure to show fewer ads, the FTC has said.\nZuckerberg defended ads, saying Meta's system is designed to \"show more ad content to people who like seeing ad content.\"\nHe suggested that Meta has even contemplated introducing a feed consisting entirely of ads.\n\"I think we have discussed it at different points but I don't think we have done it,\" he said.\nSLOW AGAINST TIKTOK\nZuckerberg testified that Meta was slow to recognize the threat TikTok posed in the late 2010s but that over the past few years the short video app has been the \"highest competitive threat for Instagram and Facebook.\"\nThe FTC has not included TikTok or YouTube in the market where it says Meta has a monopoly, arguing that they are broadcast platforms rather than networks for connecting with friends and family.\nWith TikTok and YouTube included, Meta's share of the market drops below 30%, Meta has argued.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in Washington; Editing by Mark Porter)\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized in federal court on Wednesday that he bought Instagram and WhatsApp because he saw value in the companies — not to take out competitors, as the Federal Trade Commission alleges in a historic antitrust trial.  Zuckerberg took the stand for the third day in the trial, wrapping up his testimony as the first witness Wednesday afternoon.  Hansen focused some of his questioning on emails sent by Zuckerberg and his associates that the FTC cited in earlier testimony to illustrate the Facebook founder's alarm over the growth of Instagram and his sense that he needed to neutralize its threat.\nChinese online marketplace Temu and fast-fashion retailer Shein, two of the biggest advertisers on U.S. social media, are sharply cutting their U.S. digital ad spending, industry data show, in a blow to tech companies such as Meta's Facebook and YouTube.  The online retailers, both of which ship low-priced China-made goods direct to U.S. shoppers, had been on an ad spree until recently, targeting younger, thriftier shoppers in digital media.  U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order earlier this month threatens this business.\nThe latest trading day saw Meta Platforms (META) settling at $521.52, representing a -1.87% change from its previous close.\nLast week's rally in the broader stock market indexes sprung the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) back upward after a more than 20% that technically put it into a bear market.  Income investors looking at the current landscape may be wondering if now is the best time to buy dividend stocks given the wild swings to the upside and the downside.  Here are some risks worth considering before buying dividend stocks and why ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is a good example of a dividend stock that you can buy with confidence during a bear market.\nWith President Donald Trump announcing a wide set of tariffs, there could be increased costs for a range of companies.  Visa (NYSE: V) is a giant in the payments processing space, helping to ensure secure and convenient transactions between vendors and their customers.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other Reddit stocks with high potential.\nOn April 15, Monica Guerra, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Head of US Policy, joined ‘Closing Bell Overtime’ on CNBC to discuss how investors should avoid knee-jerk reactions when it comes to volatility. Monica Guerra pointed out the significance of focusing on President Trump’s statements, as they contribute to market volatility despite their mixed and unclear nature. She acknowledged that deciphering his comments is challenging because they lack clarity but staying attentive to both presidential statements and congressional actions is still crucial. She stressed that policy certainty might emerge once Congress finalizes the budget, which is expected around August this year.\nShe also emphasized that while the day started positively with markets up by 0.79%, the situation otherwise remains uncertain. She reminded clients that the 90-day reprieve on tariffs is not the end of the story and the ongoing studies on semiconductors could lead to additional pressures related to tariffs and market volatility. Guerra noted that tariff revenues are being considered as funding sources for tax cuts and this interplay between tariffs and taxes could influence market volatility. On discussing future developments in tariff policy, she mentioned that more than 70 countries have approached President Trump in attempts to renegotiate the universal 10% tariff and reciprocal tariffs. She cautioned that even if reciprocal tariffs are eliminated and only the universal tariff remains, additional increases could be highly inflationary. China’s effective tariff rate is already at 145% and adding reciprocal tariffs could push inflationary pressures further.\nGuerra advised clients against reacting impulsively to such news and encouraged them to focus on long-term investment goals.\nWe sifted through Reddit threads to make a list of the top stocks with the highest analysts’ upside potential (at least 30%) as of April 15. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their upside potential. We have also added the hedge fund sentiment for each stock, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 262\nAverage Upside Potential as of April 15: 40.17%\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) develops products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, VR and mixed reality headsets, AR, and wearables. It operates through two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). It was formerly known as Facebook Inc. until October 2021.\nMeta’s total FoA revenue surged by 21% in Q4 2024. Notable, ad revenue for FoA alone rose by 21% as well. FoA recorded $47.3 billion in Q4 revenue, while FoA ad revenue was $46.8 billion in the same quarter. The total number of ad impressions also increased by 6%, and the average price per ad rose by 14%. Meta is further improving its revenue performance through better monetization efficiency.\nOn April 10, Thomas Champion from Piper Sandler maintained a Buy rating on the company with a $610 price target. This sentiment was fueled by performance checks with an Ad Buyer and an evaluation of Meta’s upcoming financial performance. Meta now anticipates generating $42.5 to $45.5 billion in revenue in the second quarter of the year. This will be a 9% to 16.5% improvement year-over-year.\nNightview Capital highlighted the company’s strong growth potential, due to its AI leadership with Llama model, advertising ecosystem, and AR capabilities. It stated the following regarding Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n“Core Opportunity: Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) platforms—Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Messenger—reach nearly half the world’s population daily, making it one of the most powerful advertising ecosystems globally. With investments in AI and augmented reality (AR), we believe Meta is also creating significant optionality for long-term growth.\nOverall, META ranks 8th on our list of the 12 Reddit stocks with high potential. While we acknowledge the growth potential of META, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

He eventually increased it to $1 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal, but FTC boss Andrew Ferguson wouldn't accept anything lower than $18 billion.\nThe revelations about Zuckerberg's attempts to settle with the Trump administration add a new layer of drama to the legal battle between the social media giant and the FTC, which alleges Meta became a monopoly in the market for \"personal social networking\" by buying up potential rival social media startups such as Instagram and WhatsApp.\nMeta's Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion and WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion. The FTC reviewed and approved the purchases but now wants a judge to force Meta to divest both of them.\nZuckerberg and his top aides made multiple visits to the White House to meet with President Trump and administration officials before the trial began. Zuckerberg also made two visits to the president's private Mar-a-Lago club. And Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund.\nTrump, according to the Wall Street Journal, did ask staff to work on a potential settlement. But Ferguson and the Justice Department's antitrust chief, Gail Slater, persuaded Trump to support their recommendation to proceed to trial.\nThis week in court, the FTC wasted no time laying out evidence against Zuckerberg by calling the CEO as its first trial witness.\nInstagram became the FTC's central topic as prosecutors confronted Zuckerberg with his past emails.\nIn a 2012 email, Zuckerberg told Facebook's then-CFO, David Ebersman, that purchasing Instagram and other startups could be viewed as a way for Facebook to buy time.\n\"Even if some new competitor springs up, buying Instagram, Path, Foursquare etc. now will give us a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again,\" Zuckerberg wrote, according to an account of the testimony reported by Bloomberg.\nZuckerberg agreed under questioning by the FTC's attorney that buying Instagram was intended to \"neutralize a competitor,\" but he added that the purchase was also meant to boost Facebook's quality and functionality.\n​​\"I read this as talking about incorporating the functionality and staying ahead in terms of quality. But scale is one aspect of that, and time is one aspect of that,\" Zuckerberg testified, according to Bloomberg.\n\"It's not accurate to say that the only reason we were interested was the scale or growth rate, which I think that your question is implying.\"\nZuckerberg's testimony concluded on Wednesday by addressing Facebook's view of the Chinese social media app TikTok launched in 2018.\nZuckerberg viewed the app's increasing popularity as a \"highly urgent\" threat and \"we observed that our growth slowed down dramatically.\"\n\"TikTok is still bigger than either Facebook or Instagram, and I don't like it when our competitors do better than us,\" Zuckerberg said, according to reports.\nAntitrust lawyers have said TikTok presents a potential sticking point for the FTC's case because the company offers similar services to Facebook and Instagram, yet is excluded in the group of companies that the commission claims compete in the market for personal social networking.\n\"We haven't been shy about explaining why it doesn't make sense for the FTC to bring a case to trial that requires it to prove something every 17-year-old in America knows is absurd — that Instagram doesn’t compete with TikTok,\" a Meta spokesperson said.\n\"We are prepared to win at trial.\"\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Here's what Lawrence McDonald of the Bear Traps Report has to say.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized in federal court on Wednesday that he bought Instagram and WhatsApp because he saw value in the companies — not to take out competitors, as the Federal Trade Commission alleges in a historic antitrust trial.  Zuckerberg took the stand for the third day in the trial, wrapping up his testimony as the first witness Wednesday afternoon.  Hansen focused some of his questioning on emails sent by Zuckerberg and his associates that the FTC cited in earlier testimony to illustrate the Facebook founder's alarm over the growth of Instagram and his sense that he needed to neutralize its threat.\nThe stock market has been crashing this year and if you're a long-term investor, it can be a good time to invest in companies at discounted valuations.

Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, which is now based in Singapore, said in separate but nearly identical notices that their operating expenses have gone up “due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs.”  Both companies said they would be making “price adjustments” starting April 25, although neither provided details about the size of the increases.\n(Bloomberg) -- US Treasuries rallied for a third day as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank will aim to prevent tariffs from leading to stickier inflation.Most Read from BloombergTrump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office SpaceHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?Why the Best Bike Lanes Always Get BlamedDOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on LeaveLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal CostsThe five-year note led\nTSMC, the main global producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is set to report a 57% leap in first-quarter profit on Thursday, though it is also likely to flag risks from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies.

Here's what Lawrence McDonald of the Bear Traps Report has to say.\nTrump's Treasury secretary wants business owners to relax. That's hard to do when Trump's tariffs are pushing costs higher and profits lower and threatening a recession.\nChinese online marketplace Temu and fast-fashion retailer Shein, two of the biggest advertisers on U.S. social media, are sharply cutting their U.S. digital ad spending, industry data show, in a blow to tech companies such as Meta's Facebook and YouTube.  The online retailers, both of which ship low-priced China-made goods direct to U.S. shoppers, had been on an ad spree until recently, targeting younger, thriftier shoppers in digital media.  U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order earlier this month threatens this business.\nWorld stocks fell into a downward spiral on Wednesday led by tech losses after Washington said it is putting new curbs on AI chip exports to China, marking an escalation in the global trade war.  The Trump administration's latest broadside sparked huge demand for safe-haven assets like gold, the Swiss franc and U.S. Treasuries, even though Fed Chair Jerome Powell signalled he is in no rush to cut interest rates.  If U.S. Big Tech had acquired a safe-haven status in the eyes of some investors in recent years, it is disappearing fast.\nSince his inauguration in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has announced - and sometimes reversed - tariffs on a slew of products and countries.  \"Approximately 70% of our aluminum produced in Canada is destined for U.S. customers and is now subject to 25% tariff costs ... Currently the net annual result is approximately $100 million negative for our business,\" CEO William Oplinger said during a post-earnings conference call.  The aluminum producer said the tariffs on Canadian imports had cost the company roughly $20 million in the first quarter, ended March 31.\nThe dollar resumed its fall on Wednesday with both safe-havens and risk-sensitive currencies outperforming the greenback as traders waited to see if U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration reaches new trading agreements with partners.  The dollar tumbled last week on concerns over the economic impact of new tariffs and as investors shifted allocations overseas due to uncertainty on the erratic implementation of the trade levies.  The United States is in discussions with countries including Japan, while tensions between China and the U.S. are intensifying.\nNvidia stock sank after a surprise disclosure it would take a hit north of $5 billion following new chip export restrictions.\nTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results\nSign in to access your portfolio\n\n\n\nTry again."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other American tech stocks.\nAmerican stocks moved up a bit on Monday, April 14 as investors focused on news about tech companies getting a break from President Trump’s tariffs. The S&P 500 rose by 0.8%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose by 0.6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by about 0.7%.\nREAD ALSO: 11 Best American Energy Stocks to Buy Now and 10 Best Stocks Under $10 to Buy Now.\nIn recent days, President Trump and his advisers have given mixed signals on the future of tariffs on China and on specific industries. Over the weekend, big American tech companies scored a victory when it was revealed that the US had not put tariffs on smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics.\nHowever, on Sunday, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that these electronics would soon be covered under new tariffs, which would be different from those imposed on specific countries. President Trump also posted on social media that there would be “no exception” for these products. He also said that the government is looking at semiconductors and the entire electronics supply chain in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\nLast week was the best week for the major indexes since at least 2023. However, with all this uncertainty, Wall Street is getting ready for another week of potential tariff-fueled ups and downs.\nTo compile our list of the 14 best American tech stocks to buy now, we used stock screeners from Finviz and Yahoo Finance to find the largest American technology companies. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 30 American stocks. Next, we focused on the 14 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database of more than 1,000 elite hedge funds. Finally, the 14 best American tech stocks to buy now were ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q4 2024.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 262\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), previously named Facebook, Inc., is an American multinational technology corporation that owns and operates Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company also offers a range of other devices, products, and services that are powered by AI and immersive technologies. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks among the best American stocks to buy right now.\nOn April 10, Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion reduced the firm’s price target on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) from $775 to $610 but maintained an “Overweight” rating. This adjustment reflects a cautious stance due to the company’s exposure to e-commerce and China. Champion cited performance checks with an Ad Buyer that were considered the best in the group, and focused on Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) Q2 revenue guidance of $42.5 billion to $45.5 billion, representing an increase of 9 to 16.5% year-over-year. The analyst also expects the company’s management to reiterate their fiscal year 2024 operating expense forecast of $114 to $119 billion and capital expenditures forecasted at $60 to $65 billion. Additionally, updates on Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) advancements in AI, particularly Llama 4 and the agentic opportunity, are anticipated. The revised price target is also based on reduced revenue estimates for 2025 and 2026, which have been lowered by 2% and 4%, respectively.\nOverall, META ranks 3rd on our list of the best American tech stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other best blue chip stocks to buy according to billionaires.\nThe US stock market is showing volatility after President Donald Trump’s recent announcement of sweeping 10% tariffs on all US trading partners and higher tariffs on countries with a trade deficit with the US.\nEconomists and investors believe President Trump’s tariff policies could potentially lead to a trade war with America’s trading partners, propelling inflation even higher. These two factors could plunge the US into an economic slowdown, and the markets could potentially sell off quickly if a recession materializes among its looming threats.\nOn April 10, CNBC reported that stock prices rose sharply a day before after declining for four days straight following President Trump’s announcement of a pause in a significant part of his tariff plan. The White House said that Democratic lawmakers were indulged in partisan games by inquiring if any stock market purchases conducted in recent days were undertaken with prior knowledge of the fact that President Trump would authorize a pause in his tariff plans. Trump announced higher tariffs on China even after he announced a 90-day pause for steeper-than-baseline rates for several other countries.\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Medical Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires and 10 Best Organic Food Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires.\nOn April 11, Erica York, economist and the vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy, talked to CNBC’s “The Exchange” about the ongoing scenario and said that the imposition of around 145% total tariff on Chinese goods would result in a suspension of most trade between the US and China. She said:\n“It depends on how narrowly the tariff is applied or how broadly it’s applied, but generally, if you get north of a triple-digit tariff, you are cutting off most trade.”\nShe further opined that:\n“There may still be some things without any substitutes that companies just have to foot the bill, but for the most part, that cuts it off.”\nThe economist said that Trump’s new China tariffs, along with the others he implemented, would raise the average tariff rate to record highs the country hasn’t seen since the 1940s.

He took questions from Meta attorney Mark Hansen, who has argued that his client hardly has a monopoly in social media, as the FTC claims, and still faces stiff global competition.\nHansen focused some of his questioning on emails sent by Zuckerberg and his associates that the FTC cited in earlier testimony to illustrate the Facebook founder's alarm over the growth of Instagram and his sense that he needed to neutralize its threat.\nZuckerberg said he’s very focused on inventing new things, and understanding what other people are creating is a big part of the process. At any given point in his company’s history, he said, similar tones of concern could be found in emails about what other companies were doing better than his.\n“This is my job,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I need to understand what is going on, and I need to push our teams to move quickly” to learn about what is going on in a very competitive market.\nHansen questioned Zuckerberg about competition, particularly from TikTok, the popular social media site owned by Beijing-based company ByteDance, and the the growth of the video-sharing platform YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet.\nZuckerberg testified that people spend more time on YouTube than on Facebook and Instagram combined.\nWhile Hansen noted that the FTC doesn't consider YouTube to be a Meta competitor — because it doesn't have the same friend-sharing technology as Facebook — Zuckerberg said YouTube has built in ways to share videos.\nThe FTC contends Meta has used a monopoly in its technology that facilitates connecting with friends and family to generate enormous profits as consumer satisfaction has dropped. The case could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.\nDaniel Matheson, the FTC's attorney who questioned Zuckerberg, has repeatedly brought up his own words in emails to associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram to try to show Zuckerberg was more interested halting Instagram's alarming growth than improving the product.\nUnder questioning by Hansen, Zuckerberg insisted that he had no intention of acquiring Instagram only to slow its development and end a threat. He said the focus was on \"having it run as an independent brand.”\nHansen noted that the FTC is making similar claims about the acquisition of the messaging app WhatsApp: that Zuckerberg was afraid of the company's potential.\n“It’s something I thought about,\" Zuckerberg said, noting the app's formidable capabilities, but he added that he later learned not to be worried because the owners didn't share the same vision or direction.\nHe said his interest in buying it was “the usage of it.”\n“I thought the app was important and valuable,” Zuckerberg said.\nThe trial, which is slated to last weeks, will feature other Big-Tech figures. After Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's former chief operating officer, took the stand.\nThe trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump’s FTC’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump’s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.\nFacebook bought Instagram — which was a photo-sharing app with no ads — for $1 billion in 2012.\nInstagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.\nWhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged.\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg is presiding over the case. Late last year, he denied Meta’s request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.\nThe news comes a day after Nvidia warned of a $5.5 billion hit as Washington restricted exports of its AI processor tailored for China.  Intel, under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, told clients last week that its chips would require a license for exporting to China if they have a total DRam bandwidth of 1,400 gigabytes (GB) per second or more, input-output (I/O) bandwidth of 1,100 GB per second or more, or a total of both of 1,700 GB per second or more, according to the report.  Intel's Gaudi series as well as Nvidia's H20 far exceed these requirements, the report said.\nChinese online marketplace Temu and fast-fashion retailer Shein, two of the biggest advertisers on U.S. social media, are sharply cutting their U.S. digital ad spending, industry data show, in a blow to tech companies such as Meta's Facebook and YouTube.  The online retailers, both of which ship low-priced China-made goods direct to U.S. shoppers, had been on an ad spree until recently, targeting younger, thriftier shoppers in digital media.  U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order earlier this month threatens this business.\nOne of the rare Wall Street analysts who is bearish on Meta Platforms further cut his price target for the stock, saying the Facebook parent company is \"starting to look vulnerable to a growth slowdown.\"  BNP Paribas Exane analyst Stefan Slowinksi cut his price target for Meta stock to 448 from a previous 505 in a client note late Tuesday.  Slowinski initiated coverage of Meta with the sell-equivalent call nearly 12 months ago.\nThe lawsuit claims the tech giant abused its dominance and overcharged companies for search advertising services.\nLONDON (Reuters) -Alphabet's Google is being sued in Britain for potential damages of up to 5 billion pounds ($6.6 billion) in a class action alleging the company abused its dominant market position in the online search industry.  The class action, filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal on Tuesday, argues that Google's actions enabled it to charge higher prices for the advertisements that appear in search inquiries than it otherwise could in a competitive market.  It said the U.S. tech giant contracted phone makers to pre-install Google Search and the Chrome browser on Android devices and paid Apple to make it the default search engine on iPhones, with the intention of shutting out competition.\nMeta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified this week at a high-stakes trial in Washington where the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is seeking to unwind Meta's acquisitions of prized assets Instagram and WhatsApp.  Zuckerberg in 2018 floated the idea of spinning off Instagram amid mounting pressure on Big Tech from antitrust regulators, in a sign of how seriously he took the threat of precisely the type of claims Meta now faces.  Seeking to explain messages in which he worried that Instagram was a competitive threat, Zuckerberg said the app's camera was simply better than camera features Meta had developed.\nApple stock fell more than 2% late Wednesday morning, once again putting its market capitalization below the $3 trillion mark after a brief rally.\nWith President Donald Trump announcing a wide set of tariffs, there could be increased costs for a range of companies.  Visa (NYSE: V) is a giant in the payments processing space, helping to ensure secure and convenient transactions between vendors and their customers.

In response to questioning from an FTC attorney, Zuckerberg said he thought Snapchat “wasn’t growing at the potential that it could” and that his company would have improved the app.\n“For what it’s worth, I think if we would have bought them, we would have accelerated their growth, but that’s just speculation,” Zuckerberg testified.\nThe government brought up the failed acquisition attempt to support its argument that Meta aims to preserve its dominance in the social media landscape by acquiring rivals, rather than competing with them directly. \nThe FTC is looking to force Meta to restructure or sell Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that the company spent billions to acquire the apps to fend off Facebook competitors, creating an illegal monopoly.\nTopics\nSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\nEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.\nTechCrunch's AI experts cover the latest news in the fast-moving field.\nEvery Monday, gets you up to speed on the latest advances in aerospace.\nStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\n© 2025 Yahoo.\n1,200+ founders & VCs.

GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with META.\nThe trial, which began in Washington, marks a significant legal test for federal antitrust enforcement and could potentially force Meta to divest two of its most successful platforms. Zuckerberg, called as the first witness by the FTC, addressed internal communications that the agency says reveal concerns about Instagram's rapid growth and Meta's lack of progress on similar products before acquiring the company in 2012.\nFTC attorney Daniel Matheson presented messages showing Zuckerberg's dissatisfaction with the company's internal efforts to compete in the photo-sharing space. Zuckerberg responded that he was highlighting performance issues rather than expressing acquisition motives.\nWhen asked about Instagram's treatment after the acquisition, Zuckerberg denied neglect, stating that Meta invested substantially in the platform post-purchase. He also challenged the framing of discussions about focusing on Facebook over Instagram, arguing they were not formal strategies.\nThe FTC alleges that Meta followed a long-standing approach of acquiring emerging competitors instead of developing rival products, referencing a 2008 statement by Zuckerberg that it is better to buy than compete. The agency says this strategy created barriers for new entrants and stifled innovation, particularly as users migrated from desktop to mobile platforms.\nMeta, in its defense, argues that the market is far broader than the FTC defines, pointing to competitors such as TikTok, YouTube, Apple's iMessage, and X (formerly Twitter). The company maintains that regulators cleared the acquisitions over a decade ago and that the current lawsuit undermines finality in mergers and penalizes past decisions that were lawful at the time.\nMeta also noted in a recent court filing that the FTC must prove the company holds monopoly power todaynot in the pastunderscoring the growth of rival services over the years.\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who denied Meta's request for summary judgment in late 2024, is overseeing the trial. If the court rules against Meta, the company could be required to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, a move that could cut its advertising revenue significantly.\nThe outcome could have broader implications for other technology firms, as similar antitrust actions are pending against Alphabet (GOOGL, Financials) and Amazon (AMZN, Financials), signaling a new phase in federal efforts to challenge the market dominance of large tech companies.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\nSome pointers for your click-to-message promotions.\nFrom Instagram Stories to Facebook Dating, Mark Zuckerberg’s expansionist strategy is at the center of a high-stakes antitrust case.\n(Bloomberg) -- Mark Zuckerberg, the first witness in the Federal Trade Commission’s trial to break up his social media empire, gave a rare window into how he makes business decisions: by fighting for survival, even when his company is ahead.Most Read from BloombergTrump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office SpaceHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?Why the Best Bike Lanes Always Get BlamedDOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on LeaveLA County Floats Leane\nOne of the rare Wall Street analysts who is bearish on Meta Platforms further cut his price target for the stock, saying the Facebook parent company is \"starting to look vulnerable to a growth slowdown.\"  BNP Paribas Exane analyst Stefan Slowinksi cut his price target for Meta stock to 448 from a previous 505 in a client note late Tuesday.

The messages, often between Zuckerberg and other top Meta executives, painted a picture of an executive who was paranoid about his rivals and willing to buy competitors whenever possible.\nThe FTC is seeking to force Meta to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that the two acquisitions have given Meta an illegal monopoly over parts of the social networking industry. Emails and documents presented at trial show that Meta, then called Facebook Inc., struggled to compete in the mobile app boom in the early 2010s, buying up successful competitors. The FTC said Meta bought the companies to eliminate direct competitive threats.\nMultiple Competitors\nZuckerberg and Meta’s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Meta faces a wide array of competitors that fight for user attention, including ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, Google’s YouTube, Apple Inc.’s iMessage and Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that TikTok, in particular, posed a “highly urgent” competitive threat when it sprang up in 2018.\n“We observed that our growth slowed down dramatically,” as TikTok gained popularity, Zuckerberg said Wednesday. “It was highly urgent, this has been a top priority for the company for several years.” Meta eventually rolled out a direct competitor, called Reels, that now drives a significant amount of video traffic for the company.\nZuckerberg was at times vague over his three days in court, and regularly disputed the FTC’s interpretations of his prior emails. As a leader, the way he communicated with staff was often blunt or harsh, and he spent time on the stand trying to add more nuance to what was written by his younger self. He occasionally clashed with the FTC’s lead lawyer, Daniel Matheson, who objected at one point that Zuckerberg wasn’t answering his questions.\nWhat’s unclear is how much weight those emails will ultimately have as US District Judge James Boasberg, who is presiding over the case, makes his decision. Meta has argued that the intent behind the purchases doesn’t matter, only whether those deals lead to consumer harm, which it disputes.\nBoasberg previously said the FTC will have a difficult time. Despite allowing the bulk of the case to proceed last November, Boasberg struck a skeptical tone about the FTC’s chances at trial. “Prevailing here, however, does not obscure the fact that the Commission faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial,” the judge said. “Indeed, its positions at times strain this country’s creaking antitrust precedents to their limits.”\nBoasberg also said in a ruling shortly before the trial that the FTC must prove Meta is harming competition in the present day.\nSheryl Sandberg, the company’s former chief operating officer, followed Zuckerberg on the witness stand, facing sharp questioning from FTC lawyer Susan Musser.\nIf the FTC prevails, a spinoff of Instagram and WhatsApp would undo years of integration between the apps, disrupt two of the most popular digital consumer products in the world and potentially erase hundreds of billions of dollars in Meta’s market value. It would also raise serious questions about how the government evaluates and approves deals because the government allowed the transactions to go through at the time.\n‘Network Effects’\nPart of the FTC’s case involves the technical concept of “network effects,” meaning that the more users a company like Meta has, the more likely they are to retain a dominant position, because people are unlikely to switch to a service used by few people.\nBoasberg has remained largely silent during the questioning, but interjected during Zuckerberg’s testimony Wednesday to ask if network effects still really matter.\n“How much does it matter if your friends are on a particular platform if you can send content out of that platform? Why does it matter if your friends are there?” the judge said.\nZuckerberg said it doesn’t. “These apps now serve primarily as discovery engines,” he said. “People can take that content to messaging engines.”\nBigger Company\nUnder questioning by Meta lawyer, Mark Hansen, Zuckerberg refuted the FTC’s argument that Meta bought Instagram to bury a competitor. Instagram would not likely have been able to grow to the extent it has had it remained independent, he said. “Instagram has been built out into a much more vibrant service” as a result of the deal, Zuckerberg said.\nTaking a small online platform to a billion users and beyond is unlikely to happen without the backing of a larger company, he said. “Every company that has this level of scale is owned by a bigger company,” he said, citing TikTok and YouTube as examples.\nEarlier in the trial, it was revealed that Snap Inc.’s Evan Spiegel turned down a $6 billion acquisition offer from Facebook in 2013 for its Snapchat app. Zuckerberg said that the app would have grown more rapidly had it joined his company.\nZuckerberg sought to walk back some statements that he made in previous internal communications. He acknowledged that he sent a 2013 email saying that Facebook blocked advertising for messaging apps WeChat, Kakao and Line, in which he wrote the apps were “trying to build social networks to replace us.” On the stand this week, however, he said “it’s hard for me to characterize what their intent was.”\nMatheson also sought to show that Meta was aware of its antitrust risk years ago, including a possible breakup.\nHe displayed an email from 2018 in which Zuckerberg suggested that Meta should consider spinning off Instagram into a standalone company. “As calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway,” he wrote.\nAt one point, Zuckerberg was asked by Hansen to describe how he was evaluating the competitive threat posed by Instagram and others at the time of the deals. He referenced a quote from former Intel Corp. CEO Andy Grove: “Only the paranoid survive.”\n(Updates with color on Zuckerberg testimony starting in the first paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nTrump's trade war is causing all sorts of extreme dislocations in market and economic sentiment.\n(Bloomberg) -- Shale fracker Liberty Energy Inc. posted its worst earnings in three years amid plunging oil prices and mounting concerns about energy demand.Most Read from BloombergTrump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office SpaceHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?Why the Best Bike Lanes Always Get BlamedDOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on LeaveLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal CostsAdjusted first-quarter profit fell to 4 cen\nEven in the midst of a sharp drop in his company’s stock price and a freight market that is not supporting the bottom line at Triumph Financial, CEO Aaron Graft touted milestones reached and signaled a new aggressiveness in pricing the company’s products.

The testimony painted a picture of how Zuckerberg views the competition and the company’s struggles to keep up with a rapidly evolving social media landscape that it argues has pushed users toward rivals like TikTok and YouTube.\n    \n\n            There’s a lot at stake for Meta, as it could be forced to offload Instagram and WhatsApp if it loses.\n    \n\n            Here are the biggest takeaways from Zuckerberg, who took the stand just before former Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg testified on Wednesday.\n    \n\n            In 2018, Zuckerberg raised concerns to other executives that “as calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway,” according to an email produced in court.\n    \n\n            In light of that, Zuckerberg suggested spinning off Instagram because the company’s “family of apps” structure could hurt Facebook. He added: “most companies actually perform better after they’ve been split up.”\n    \n\n            Of course, Meta didn’t end up spinning Instagram or WhatsApp off, and it’s now in court fighting the FTC to avoid having to do just that.\n    \n\n            Zuckerberg was indeed concerned that WhatsApp and Instagram could threaten Facebook’s dominance prior to buying the platforms, documents presented during FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson’s questioning suggested.\n    \n\n            In 2011, Zuckerberg appeared to realize that Facebook’s now-defunct Facebook Camera service was falling behind Instagram in functionality and popularity.\n    \n\n            “In the time it has taken us to get our act together on this, Instagram has become a large and viable competitor to us on mobile photos, which will increasingly be the future of photos,” Zuckerberg wrote in an email at the time. Facebook ended up acquiring Instagram for $1 billion in April 2012.\n    \n\n            In a 2012 email to then-COO Sandberg, Zuckerberg said then-Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer’s teams “are executing well technically but their results this year are only okay so far.”\n    \n\n            “Messenger isn’t beating WhatsApp, Instagram was growing so much faster than us that we had to buy them for $1 billion,” he wrote in the email. “That’s not exactly killing it.”\n    \n\n            Then in 2013, Zuckerberg told then-growth head Javier Olivan he worried that WhatsApp would develop features similar to Facebook and Instagram and could “start winning in the US and other markets.” Olivan responded at the time he had been having “sleepless nights” worried that WhatsApp was “the real deal.” Facebook had also been concerned around that time that Google could acquire WhatsApp before it did.\n    \n\n            But Zuckerberg said in court Wednesday, during cross examination by Meta’s lawyer, that he thought it was “extremely unlikely” that WhatsApp would build competitive features after his first meeting with the platform’s co-founder Jan Koum.\n    \n\n            Facebook bought WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion.\n    \n\n            Zuckerberg also claimed that Meta made both platforms better for users by acquiring them.\n    \n\n            Zuckerberg originally built Facebook to connect and share content with friends and family. That’s the market that the FTC claims Meta now dominates.\n    \n\n            But Zuckerberg said that kind of use of his product has been declining.\n    \n\n            The FTC’s lawyer on Tuesday asked Zuckerberg about an internal document from 2022 that indicated “friending and friend sharing are losing steam.”\n    \n\n            “The amount that people are sharing with friends on Facebook, especially, has been declining,” Zuckerberg said. “Even the amount of new friends that people add … I think has been declining. But I don’t know the exact numbers.”\n    \n\n            But the future isn’t necessarily the content creator-filled feeds that have become the norm on Meta’s products. Instead, Zuckerberg said, messaging between individuals or friend groups is becoming more popular than sharing content on more public social media feeds.\n    \n\n            “Messaging has been growing dramatically, and sharing with friends in feeds has been declining,” he said Tuesday.\n    \n\n            It’s not just TikTok and Snapchat; Google’s YouTube platform is also a major rival to Facebook, the Meta CEO said on the stand this week.\n    \n\n            YouTube has indeed been capturing the attention of younger audiences; Pew Research found that nine in 10 US teens use YouTube, while Facebook usage has “steeply declined” over the past decade among that age group.\n    \n\n            Zuckerberg attributed this in part to a rise in “richer forms of media,” like video, as mobile networks have grown more capable in the last 10 years. “YouTube is the most competitive for creators,” he said Wednesday, referring to online personalities that garner huge followings through posting videos on platforms like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.\n    \n\n            “My understanding … is that people spend more time on YouTube than on Facebook and Instagram combined, certainly more than either one independently,” he said.\n    \n\n            Still, Meta holds a firm grip on the social media market, especially in the US, according to Pew Research, where it operates a quarter of the most widely-used social media platforms.\n    \nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Hansen focused some of his questioning on emails sent by Zuckerberg and his associates that the FTC cited in earlier testimony to illustrate the Facebook founder's alarm over the growth of Instagram and his sense that he needed to neutralize its threat.\n(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration halted work on an offshore wind farm being built off New York amid a broader review of the sector’s projects.Most Read from BloombergTrump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office SpaceHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?Why the Best Bike Lanes Always Get BlamedDOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on LeaveLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal CostsInterior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered the pause on\nUnderstanding what credit inquiries are, when they occur, and how they affect your credit can help you protect and improve your credit score.\nTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results\nSign in to access your portfolio\n\n\n\nTry again."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) stands against other best value dividend stocks.\nDividends, though sometimes underappreciated, have significantly contributed to long-term investor gains. Between 1960 and the end of the previous year, reinvested dividends and the effects of compounding accounted for about 85% of the S&P Index’s total return. Dividend-oriented strategies offer the advantage of steady income, improved portfolio stability, and a potential buffer during uncertain economic periods—making them a strong choice for all-weather portfolios.\nWith ongoing tariff tensions in the US adding to market volatility, many investors have begun favoring dividend-focused approaches to strengthen their portfolios. After a stretch where growth stocks took center stage, dividend investing has started to regain traction. According to a report by Franklin Templeton, US-listed dividend ETFs recorded average monthly net inflows of nearly $3.3 billion during the six months leading up to January 31, 2025—up sharply from just $107 million during the same period a year earlier.\nGiven the uncertain global environment, investors have increasingly leaned toward more reliable components to maintain portfolio balance. Dividend-paying stocks—particularly those backed by strong fundamentals—have emerged as a preferred option due to their ability to generate stable and predictable cash flows. Since these cash flows play a central role in equity valuation models, determining the intrinsic value of dividend stocks typically involves less uncertainty compared to valuing growth-oriented equities. As a result, such stocks are seen as a stabilizing force within a diversified investment strategy.\nAccording to analysts, the strength of dividend-paying stocks lies in their capacity to cushion portfolio losses during market downturns while still providing a meaningful upside. Historically, dividend strategies have shown defensive qualities across different regions and time periods. Data for the three-year span ending December 31, 2024, revealed that dividend stocks experienced lower volatility and smaller maximum drawdowns than the broader market in global, US, and European segments. Notably, when concerns over inflation and rising interest rates resurfaced in August, dividend stocks proved more resilient than their growth-focused counterparts.\nHistorically, income-focused investing often leans heavily toward value stocks, as investors typically look for companies offering high dividend yields and lower valuation multiples. However, a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices points out that the Dividend Aristocrats Index strikes a balance between both value and growth characteristics. Since 1999, the index has maintained an average composition of roughly 60.5% value stocks and 39.5% growth stocks, showing no consistent bias toward either investing style. Analysts maintained that a portfolio combining strong dividend yield, consistent dividend growth, and resilience in payouts should always remain relevant. They noted that even without relying on market revaluation, the combination of income and income growth could support projected nominal gross returns exceeding 10% annually.\nA specialized industrial laboratory, filled with high-tech machinery for producing abrasives.\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 proprietary database of billionaires’ stock holdings and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked dividend stocks with forward P/E ratios below 20, as of April 13. The stocks are ranked according to the number of billionaires having stakes in them. Where two or more stocks were tied on billionaire sentiment, we used forward P/Es as a tiebreaker between them.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Billionaire Holders: 17\nForward P/E Ratio as of April 13: 17.42\n3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is a Minnesota-based multinational conglomerate that operates in a wide range of industries. The stock is outperforming the broader market this year, surging by nearly 5% since the start of 2025. In the past 12 months, MMM has delivered a nearly 49% return to shareholders. The rise signals growing investor confidence in CEO Bill Brown’s strategy to steer the company back on track. Several challenges are already showing signs of progress, and where that’s not yet the case, Brown has set plans in motion. For instance, the healthcare division was spun off into a new company called Solventum last year. In addition, 3M has reached settlements related to PFAS and combat earplugs, providing both management and shareholders with greater clarity regarding future financial obligations.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) reported revenue topping $6 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts by $157 million. The firm has recently focused on reinforcing its core business segments, with innovation continuing to play a central role. Investments in exclusive technologies and patents have helped sharpen its competitive advantage. Meanwhile, steps to boost efficiency—particularly within the supply chain—have led to a 70% improvement in suppliers meeting delivery timelines. The company’s ability to manage regulatory issues and ongoing legal matters has also contributed to its financial resilience and investor trust. With a forward P/E ratio of 17.42, MMM is one of the best value stocks to monitor.\n3M Company (NYSE:MMM) also maintained a healthy cash flow throughout FY24, generating $1.8 billion from operations and $4.9 billion in free cash. During the year, it returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through a mix of dividends and stock buybacks. Notably, on February 4, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 4.3% to $0.73 per share—the first increase since halving the payout in May of the previous year. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.15%, as of April 13.\nOverall, MMM ranks 6th on our list of the best value dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of MMM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than MMM but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

US stocks opening in the red this morning with tech leading the losses here. Options data showing investors are positioning for further losses in mega cap tech and semis ahead of earnings. That's according to data from Bloomberg. Joining us now with more, David Harden, Summit Global Investments CIO. David, great to speak with you this morning. Certainly a lot of pain for the big tech names this morning.\nThank you.\nAre you buying big tech at these levels?\nWell, I think there's some definitely buying opportunities that are coming available. For example, one of the things that I like is Google. Google has $25 billion in free cash flows last quarter. It's it's it's growing at double digits year-over-year. Its profit margins are great. Its return on equity is around 30%. And the PE is now finally getting down into those reasonable levels you can consider 16, 17, 15. So I think I think these are buying opportunities to start accumulating more positions in something like a Google.\nI think what you're highlighting is the, you know, this one thing is not like the other in the tech trade even as you're looking at what is more of a platform play where there's perhaps more of a reason to believe that the consumers would flow into free products that a Google might offer online versus what we're seeing in some of the products and propensity to spend in some of the other tech plays where there might be a consumer pullback in those discretionary dollars. How do you continue to look across these companies once we get into earnings and see how they're forecasting and guiding for the rest of the year on that?\nYeah, I think that's really important because where did their earnings come from, right? And and how are they tied to tariffs? That's really important. And how does those tariffs impact like advertising for Google. So you want to look kind of through those earnings into the consumer and and see what that consumer's doing and how that consumer's acting. And I think that's another play in tech. There is a separation. What? Are they hardware? Like Apple's had to navigate a lot more tariff news than Google's had to navigate, even though they're both navigating it.\nAnd we're starting to see individual companies being used as tools in this trade war. Obviously with Nvidia's specific chips being impacted by export controls, to what extent does that change any fundamental view you have on these stocks or should investors look past any of that daily headline news on tariffs?\nI I I think absolutely, you have to consider that and you have to manage your your risk here. Risk is really, really important in these markets and managing that is essential. So where you have the H20 chip, for example, invidia, they have clearly shown last night on their earnings that they have a difficult time more difficult time than some of these other tech names. So look for tech names that are more US based. Look for tech names that have more um say high-quality earnings. Even though somebody could question Google's high quality earnings, their earnings scores are not very good, but it is more US based. It is more consumer based in the US. And so that's very, very important in tech.\nIt seems like we've all been asking the question of what's the next big catalyst to drive conviction within the markets. Does that mean the AI trade or the fast-paced growth cycle for the AI trade is dead?\nNo, I don't think so because let's face it. Probably 10 minutes ago you were looking at AI, or I was looking at AI, or somebody was looking at some agent and the and the new things that are coming out with AI agents and things of this nature are absolutely impactful. The power of AI is growing. It's not shrinking. We're using it more. And it will continue to spread. So I think that trade's not done. I think there'll continue to be infrastructure build outs and AI things, but it has to go past just the technology. You have to look into the in industrial side of tech and where are they putting and building these centers at.\nI want to get to one of your cells, but first really quickly, would you buy Nvidia at these levels?\nUh probably not right now. No. I would be if you're if you're in it, it's time to hold and be patient. But if you're looking to buy, I think there's better opportunities to buy.\nAnd I know one of them is Microsoft, correct?\nI if you're looking at the two comparison, yes, Microsoft today, Nvidia's down more 6-7%, Microsoft's down in one, one and a half right now. I I think that's a safer play. It's a little bit more if if you will ingrained in our society. The revenues are are more um consistent. And so that's something that I would look at is more something like a Google or Microsoft. Both of those I would consider buying opportunities, especially at these levels.\nAnd I know a sell for you is one member of the mag 7. Talk to us about Tesla.\nWell, I think Tesla's had some negative earnings. We know that and um it's under pressure. I think every Tesla's uh I I saw a sticker on the back of a Tesla the other day that said something like, I bought this post crazy. So this is this is very, very important right now in our society. But having said that, I think Elon Musk is going to tell you when it's the right time to buy Tesla. And he hasn't done that yet. So he he's outspoken. We know what he's capable of. And until he's ready to let us know it's the right time to buy, I think it's you avoid that stock right now.\nOutside of tech, where's your favorite trade, your top idea right now?\nAnd I think I think outside of tech, you're going to have to look at some of the healthcare companies that have really been hurt with the Pharmatech news and other things.\nIt seems like they're next though in the docket for what potential tariffs may look like.\nOh, absolutely. So look for those healthcare companies that are not necessarily tied to pharma and they get their revenue, surgical centers and other places that are hospital-based, that are US-based, that we are going to use on a daily basis, but really are not tied to that. Those are the ones that have been kind of the baby been thrown out with the bath water. Their their valuations are very good right now.\nAbsolutely. David, great to see you here in studio.

But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during an interview with Jonathan Karl of ABC News on Sunday that the move was temporary and only applied to Trump's reciprocal tariffs.\nInstead, he explained, tech products will be tariffed as part of the administration's planned duties on semiconductors, which could be announced later this week.\nStill, even the threat of sky-high tariffs won't be enough to force tech giants like Apple to pick up and move their suppliers to the US en masse.\nRead more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\n\"Anything is possible, but the setup of smartphone production in India has been a three-year process from site identification through ramped-up production, with at least another two years to achieve full supply chain integration,\" Chris Rogers, head of supply chain research at S&P Global Market Intelligence, told Yahoo Finance.\nIt's not just about timing. Companies would also need the workers to build devices.\n\"While there's a degree of automation possible and while many of the components needed are made in the US, there's still a need for tens of thousands of trained electronics assemblers willing to work long, arduous hours in highly repetitive tasks,\" he added.\nCompanies including Nvidia (NVDA), TSMC (TSM), Apple, and others have announced increased investments in the US to win over Trump and avoid tariffs. On Monday, Nvidia said it will produce $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years through partners including Foxconn (601138.SS), TSMC, and Wistron (3231.TW).\nApple also said it will spend $500 billion, and TSMC has said it will spend $165 billion. Many of those plans, however, were already in the works or don't necessarily go above prior spending levels. Nvidia, for example, talked up building chips in the US last year.\nAnd while that doesn't take away from the fact that the companies are pouring money into the US, it doesn't exactly support the idea that they're moving vast amounts of their manufacturing capabilities to America.\n\"We believe hardware companies will remain focused on accelerating US-bound product assembly out of China, and see India and Mexico as the most-likely incremental beneficiaries of these actions (we'd argue Vietnam and Mexico have been the biggest beneficiaries over the last 5 years),\" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in an investor note.\n\"We just don't see large volume hardware production ever reaching US shores — these plans take years to devise, the costs (capex and opex) associated with manufacturing hundreds of millions of products annually in the US are high, and most importantly, tariff exemptions on finished goods disincentivize on-shoring (and is why we didn't see onshoring after President Trump's first administration),\" he added\nEven if companies brought their manufacturing bases to the US, they'd still have to deal with a host of headwinds ranging from worker salaries to the need to continue importing certain parts from abroad.\nAccording to Bank of America's Wamsi Mohan, while Apple may be able to find enough laborers in the US to build its iPhones, importing the company's entire supply chain will still take some time.\n\"This is because, while it may be possible to move final assembly to the US, moving the entire iPhone supply chain would be a much bigger undertaking and would likely take many years, if even possible.\"\nIt's not just Apple that's contending with these issues. Everything from laptop makers to display producers would face the same problems if they were to move to the US. That doesn't even take into account the potential price increases associated with manufacturing tech products in the US.\nAccording to some estimates, prices on devices could jump by hundreds of dollars, resulting in demand destruction as consumers seek out less expensive options or hold onto their existing smartphones and computers for longer periods.\nWhile it's unlikely manufacturing is coming back to the US, there's still plenty of uncertainty about how tech companies and consumers navigate the next four years of tariff shocks.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other AI stocks on the move.\nMarket uncertainty aside, the AI race is tighter than ever. A report by Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) states that not only has the battlefield become tighter, but also more crowded than previously. The report notes that Google and OpenAI are neck to neck in the race to build cutting-edge AI, and that other companies are fiercely closing in. Meta, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI are a few of these names. Chinese competitors are also closing in on the AI race. In particular, DeepSeek’s R1 model is very close to the top-performing models of two of the leading AI companies.\n“It creates an exciting space. It’s good that these models are not all developed by five guys in Silicon Valley. Chinese models are catching up as far as performance to the US models..but across the globe, there are new players emerging in the space.”\nIn recent news, OpenAI has launched its new AI model GPT-4.1, along with smaller versions GPT-4.1 mini and GPT-4.1 nano. These models boast major improvements in coding, instruction following, and long context comprehension.\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid Market Volatility and 14 AI Stocks Catching Wall Street’s Attention\nAccording to OpenAI, the models outperform the company’s most advanced GPT-4o model across the board and are available only on OpenAI’s application programming interface (API). In particular, the GPT-4.1 brags a 21% improvement over GPT-4o and 27% over GPT-4.5 on coding. Moreover, there are improvements in instruction following and long context comprehension, which make these models a better choice for powering AI agents.\n“Benchmarks are strong, but we focused on real-world utility, and developers seem very happy.”\nOpenAI also noted that these models operate at a “much lower cost” compared to GPT-4.5, and that the company would turn off the GPT-4.5 preview that is available in the API in July because the new models offer “improved or similar performance.”\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points  (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 317\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) provides AI-powered cloud, productivity, and business solutions, focusing on efficiency, security, and AI advancements. On April 14, UBS lowered the firm’s price target on the stock to $480 from $510 and kept a “Buy” rating on the shares. The firm’s price target revision comes after Microsoft’s formal acknowledgement that it is slowing or pausing some data center projects. The firm’s evaluation reveals that Microsoft’s adjustments are most likely not AI demand-related, and that the pausing activity isn’t a materially negative AI demand signal. The analyst further told investors in a research note that any capacity changes related to OpenAI can be absorbed by Oracle and others.\nOverall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of AI stocks on the move. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Called BitNet b1.58 2B4T, it’s openly available under an MIT license and can run on CPUs, including Apple’s M2.\nBitnets are essentially compressed models designed to run on lightweight hardware. In standard models, weights, the values that define the internal structure of a model, are often quantized so the models perform well on a wide range of machines. Quantizing the weights lowers the number of bits — the smallest units a computer can process — needed to represent those weights, enabling models to run on chips with less memory, faster.\nBitnets quantize weights into just three values: -1, 0, and 1. In theory, that makes them far more memory- and computing-efficient than most models today.\nThe Microsoft researchers say that BitNet b1.58 2B4T is the first bitnet with 2 billion parameters, “parameters” being largely synonymous with “weights.” Trained on a dataset of 4 trillion tokens — equivalent to about 33 million books, by one estimate — BitNet b1.58 2B4T outperforms traditional models of similar sizes, the researchers claim.\nBitNet b1.58 2B4T doesn’t sweep the floor with rival 2 billion-parameter models, to be clear, but it seemingly holds its own. According to the researchers’ testing, the model surpasses Meta’s Llama 3.2 1B, Google’s Gemma 3 1B, and Alibaba’s Qwen 2.5 1.5B on benchmarks including GSM8K (a collection of grade-school-level math problems) and PIQA (which tests physical commonsense reasoning skills).\nPerhaps more impressively, BitNet b1.58 2B4T is speedier than other models of its size — in some cases, twice the speed — while using a fraction of the memory. \nThere is a catch, however. \nAchieving that performance requires using Microsoft’s custom framework, bitnet.cpp, which only works with certain hardware at the moment. Absent from the list of supported chips are GPUs, which dominate the AI infrastructure landscape. \nThat’s all to say that bitnets may hold promise, particularly for resource-constrained devices. But compatibility is — and will likely remain — a big sticking point.\nTopics\n\nAI Editor\n\n Microsoft researchers say they’ve developed a hyper-efficient AI model that can run on CPUs\n\n\n\n Figma ignores the fear, files paperwork for an IPO\n\n\n\n For security, Android phones will now auto-reboot after three days\n\n\n\n Figma sent a cease-and-desist letter to Lovable over the term ‘Dev Mode’\n\n\n\n Notorious image board 4chan hacked and internal data leaked\n\n\n\n Notion releases an AI-powered email client for Gmail\n\n\n\n Hertz says customers’ personal data and driver’s licenses stolen in data breach\n\n\n\n© 2025 Yahoo.\n1,200+ founders & VCs.

Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, which is now based in Singapore, said in separate but nearly identical notices that their operating expenses have gone up “due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs.”  Both companies said they would be making “price adjustments” starting April 25, although neither provided details about the size of the increases.\nTSMC, the main global producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is set to report a 57% leap in first-quarter profit on Thursday, though it is also likely to flag risks from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is expected to report a net profit of T$354.6 billion ($10.92 billion) for the three months ended March 31, according to a LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 18 analysts.\nTrump's Treasury secretary wants business owners to relax. That's hard to do when Trump's tariffs are pushing costs higher and profits lower and threatening a recession.\nChinese online marketplace Temu and fast-fashion retailer Shein, two of the biggest advertisers on U.S. social media, are sharply cutting their U.S. digital ad spending, industry data show, in a blow to tech companies such as Meta's Facebook and YouTube.  The online retailers, both of which ship low-priced China-made goods direct to U.S. shoppers, had been on an ad spree until recently, targeting younger, thriftier shoppers in digital media.  U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order earlier this month threatens this business.\nAll is not lost when it comes to investing in Nvidia. Here's what Lawrence McDonald of the Bear Traps Report has to say.\nWorld stocks fell into a downward spiral on Wednesday led by tech losses after Washington said it is putting new curbs on AI chip exports to China, marking an escalation in the global trade war.  The Trump administration's latest broadside sparked huge demand for safe-haven assets like gold, the Swiss franc and U.S. Treasuries, even though Fed Chair Jerome Powell signalled he is in no rush to cut interest rates.  If U.S. Big Tech had acquired a safe-haven status in the eyes of some investors in recent years, it is disappearing fast.\nSince his inauguration in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has announced - and sometimes reversed - tariffs on a slew of products and countries.  \"Approximately 70% of our aluminum produced in Canada is destined for U.S. customers and is now subject to 25% tariff costs ... Currently the net annual result is approximately $100 million negative for our business,\" CEO William Oplinger said during a post-earnings conference call.  The aluminum producer said the tariffs on Canadian imports had cost the company roughly $20 million in the first quarter, ended March 31.\nThe dollar resumed its fall on Wednesday with both safe-havens and risk-sensitive currencies outperforming the greenback as traders waited to see if U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration reaches new trading agreements with partners.  The dollar tumbled last week on concerns over the economic impact of new tariffs and as investors shifted allocations overseas due to uncertainty on the erratic implementation of the trade levies.  The United States is in discussions with countries including Japan, while tensions between China and the U.S. are intensifying.\n(Reuters) -The ripple effects of Donald Trump's global trade war are increasingly being felt across numerous industries all at once and on Wednesday were once again exerting pressure on U.S. stock markets that have been roiled for weeks by his erratic trade policies.  Stocks fell broadly, with tech stocks hit particularly hard after bellwethers like Nvidia that are highly tied into the world's supply chain warned of hits to their bottom line.  Meanwhile, airlines said they are bracing for an uncertain summer travel season, and the head of the Federal Reserve noted slowing economic activity - but also cast a wary eye on the threat that tariffs pose to its goal of lowering inflation.\nTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results\nSign in to access your portfolio\n\n\n\nTry again."

The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office365, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares detracted from performance as Azure revenue growth missed analyst estimates, marking the third consecutive quarter of modest disappointment in this segment. However, AI-related sales growth exceeded expectations, accounting for 13% of Azure’s quarterly growth.

Both technology giants have deeply rooted histories in enterprise software, with Microsoft evolving from its Windows operating system foundation to become a cloud powerhouse, while Oracle built its empire on database technologies. As businesses worldwide accelerate their digital transformation initiatives, these companies continue to position themselves as essential partners in this journey. With artificial intelligence now driving the next wave of cloud innovation, comparing these two technology stalwarts offers valuable insights for investors seeking exposure to this high-growth sector. Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now.\nMicrosoft's cloud momentum continues to impress, with its Microsoft Cloud surpassing $40 billion in quarterly revenues for the first time in second-quarter fiscal 2025, representing robust 21% year-over-year growth. This performance demonstrates the company's successful transition from traditional software to cloud services. The Redmond-based tech giant has strategically positioned itself at the forefront of the AI revolution, with its AI business reaching an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion, growing 175% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Microsoft’s fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $275.39 billion, suggesting 12.35% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $13.04 per share, indicating a 10.51% year-over-year increase. The figure has moved south by 0.2% over the past 30 days.See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.Microsoft's strength lies in its comprehensive cloud ecosystem, spanning infrastructure (Azure), platform services, and software-as-a-service offerings. Azure, Microsoft's cloud infrastructure business, remains a key growth driver. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure combined accounted for a whopping 68% of the global cloud market in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to new data from IT market research firm Synergy.Microsoft has been steadily gaining share with fruitful strategic partnerships like one with OpenAI's APIs, exclusively running on Azure, providing Microsoft customers access to industry-leading AI models.On the innovation front, Microsoft continues to lead with groundbreaking solutions. In March 2025 alone, the company introduced several powerful innovations, including Azure AI Foundry's Responses API and Computer-Using Agent for AI-powered applications, as well as Microsoft Dragon Copilot for clinical workflows in healthcare. The company's commitment to data sovereignty is evident through its completion of the EU Data Boundary for Microsoft Cloud, enhancing its appeal to European customers.Microsoft's financial health remains strong, with operating income growing 17% in its most recent quarter. The company's strategic expansion of Copilot+ PC experiences across all major silicon platforms signals a significant pivot to increase market penetration of its AI capabilities. Furthermore, MSFT's introduction of AI agents to its Security Copilot platform addresses the escalating cybersecurity challenges facing organizations worldwide, with the company detecting more than 30 billion phishing emails and 7,000 password attacks per second in 2024.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nOracle has made strides in cloud infrastructure with its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (“OCI”), reporting 51% revenue growth in its recent quarter. The company crossed a milestone with its 101st cloud region coming online, positioning itself to eventually have more regions than its competitors combined. Oracle's Gen 2 cloud architecture gives customers flexibility, which the company claims is a strategic advantage.However, Oracle's overall performance raises concerns. In its third-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, the company missed both earnings and revenue expectations, with EPS of $1.47 missing analyst estimates by $0.02 and revenue of $14.13 billion falling short by $259 million. While Oracle touts its cloud revenue growth, its total revenue growth of just 6.4% year over year pales in comparison to Microsoft's double-digit growth rates.The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.04 per share, down a penny over the past 30 days.More troubling are the recent security challenges that could significantly impact Oracle's market position and investor confidence. Following two confirmed security breaches within a single month, questions have arisen about the company's ability to protect sensitive client data. After initially denying claims that its cloud storage had been compromised, Oracle later acknowledged to clients that an attacker had infiltrated what it described as a legacy environment. This comes on the heels of a separate breach where hackers accessed Oracle servers and copied patient data in an apparent attempt to extort multiple U.S. medical providers.Oracle's partnerships with hyperscalers like Microsoft through the Oracle Database@Azure service show promise, but the company faces execution challenges as it plays catch-up in the competitive cloud market. While Oracle claims its remaining performance obligations reached $130 billion, up 63% year over year, the company still struggles with capacity constraints, as demand continues to dramatically outstrip supply.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation perspective, MSFT trades at a premium to Oracle, with a forward 12-month price/sales ratio of 9.43 compared to Oracle's 5.83. This premium valuation reflects investor confidence in Microsoft's stronger growth prospects and market position.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile both companies have seen their shares decline in 2025, Microsoft has shown greater resilience, with shares declining 8.6% year to date, significantly outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and Oracle's steeper 13.9% and 19.6% drop, respectively, during the same period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe sector as a whole has faced headwinds, including concerns about AI spending and the impact of tariff measures under the Trump administration. Microsoft has announced that it is \"slowing or pausing\" some of its AI data center projects, though the company remains committed to long-term AI investments. Oracle, meanwhile, faces more significant challenges with component delays that have slowed cloud capacity expansion, potentially limiting its ability to capture market share during this crucial growth phase.\nWhile both Microsoft and Oracle offer exposure to the booming cloud computing and AI markets, MSFT emerges as the more compelling investment opportunity. With its superior growth rates, broader cloud ecosystem, stronger financial performance, and innovative AI solutions, Microsoft is better positioned to capitalize on these technological trends. Oracle's recent security breaches, capacity constraints, and weaker financial performance raise concerns about its ability to compete effectively in the rapidly evolving cloud landscape. For investors seeking long-term growth potential in cloud computing, Microsoft, with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) compared to Oracle's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), presents a more promising bet with stronger upside potential in this AI-driven era.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other AI stocks you shouldn’t overlook right now.\nAccording to Adam Thierer, a senior fellow at the center-right think tank R Street Institute, Trump’s tariffs could prove to be a massive gift for China, even helping it catch up in the AI race.\n“It’s going to be very hard for the U.S. to win the so-called AI Cold War if America’s trade policies are simultaneously tanking global markets, discouraging technological investments, and potentially undermining traditional alliances with key allies.”\nTrump’s policies are disrupting supply chains and causing volatility in global markets, which may lead US allies to turn to China to meet their technological needs.\n“Suddenly, in the wake of this trade fiasco, we see EU officials saying, ‘Let’s get on the phone with China and talk. Huawei has this telecommunications hardware system they want to sell, and there’s also these AI models that are free of charge.”\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI Stocks on the Move and  10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid Market Volatility.\nWith all the tensions caused by the US tariffs, China’s President Xi Jinping has recently called for stronger ties with Vietnam on trade and supply chains as he attended the signing of dozens of cooperation agreements between the two nations. While Beijing faces 145% U.S. duties, Vietnam has been negotiating a reduction of U.S. tariffs of 46% that would otherwise apply in July after a global moratorium expires, Reuters reported.\n“The two sides should strengthen cooperation in production and supply chains,” Xi\nThe President has also urged increased trade and stronger ties with Hanoi on artificial intelligence and the green economy.\nDiscussing the meetings, U.S. President Donald Trump said that the two countries’ discussions were focused on harming the United States. However, he said that he did not blame them for holding such talks.\n“I don’t blame China; I don’t blame Vietnam. That’s a lovely meeting. Meeting like, trying to figure out, ‘how do we screw the United States of America?'”\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points  (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 317\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) provides AI-powered cloud, productivity, and business solutions, focusing on efficiency, security, and AI advancements. On April 15, Bank of America reiterated the stock as “Buy” and lowered its price target on the stock to $480 per share from $510.\n“There have been rumors that Microsoft is pulling back on capex. While Microsoft is likely shifting capex within geographies, the company remains building capacity for the long term.”\nA day prior, UBS also lowered the firm’s price target on the stock to $480 from $510 and kept a “Buy” rating on the shares. The firm’s price target revision also came after Microsoft’s formal acknowledgement that it is slowing or pausing some data center projects. The firm’s evaluation reveals that the company’s adjustments are most likely not AI demand-related, and that the pausing activity isn’t a materially negative AI demand signal.\nOverall, MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks you shouldn’t overlook right now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

So after the chip maker disclosed that it would take a $5.5 billion dollar hit from the US government's surprise new controls on its semiconductor exports to China. For more on the latest, let's welcome now Daniel Newman, Futurum CEO. Daniel, it is great to see you here on set. Appreciate it from Texas. Um, you know, before J. Powell, frankly, this was the story of the day. It was chips, it was Nvidia. Nvidia is down here, Dan. It's not about 10%. It's getting clobbered in today's trade. I guess two, two questions to start. One, Dan, were you surprised by that news when you saw those headlines? And two, do you think down 10%, is that move justified in your opinion?\nYeah, first of all, nobody should have been surprised by this move. Really the administration's been giving the signal that it was going to clamp down. Now, what was interesting is this week, there was a bit of gyration because they cut this deal, they announced 500 billion dollars of AI supercomputers being built here in the United States. And then a day later, he pulls back on this new export licensing requirement.\nThat that, you bring that, Dan. That is an interesting point because there were some folks who thought Jensen Wong was going to be kind of shielded from this. Right?\nThey made a deal. I had a few reporters actually hit me up, do you think there was some tip for tat going on. And first of all, I think Trump needs to show, President Trump needs to show that there is no tip for tat. So whether it's, you know, Tim Cook bringing more manufacturing here, whether it's TSMC coming here. But I actually think on the other side of this, and maybe we come back to this, is that I actually think creating some certainty with the, with the community, the business community, about what type of benefit they can expect by onshoring and bringing manufacturing back here. I think that would be a great start. Having said that, national security, economic security, and AI are tightly correlated. Us giving the chips to China, whether it's the tuned down chips or the best chips coming through intermediaries, which they shouldn't be getting. This is something that's giving an advantaging China. There's a lot of people out there that are like, oh, well, this is going to only push their resolve. Do you think China is waiting because we're sending Nvidia chips, they're not investing in Huawei and building their own chips? You can be absolutely certain that they are. This war, this trade war, is largely being fought on the grounds of long-term economic domination. Long-term economic domination will only be had if we control the technology trade. Nvidia is at the forefront of that trade.\nAnd what do you think of from an investor standpoint? Here you have Nvidia falling yet again, 8 to 10%. You know, look what happened over the last couple days. It had recovered from its lows, right? And a lot of investors who got in short term experienced that bounce. Where, where do you think that looks like this week?\nYeah. I, I look at that line of people around the corner at $150 that just couldn't wait to buy. And you go, what is really changed? Well, first of all, you've got GPUs melting over at, at X and at OpenAI. There's so much demand there. Could Nvidia pivot some of its capacity, not focus so much on building specialized products for China, and make sure we meet all the capacity and demand that's out there for companies that are in the US that are trying to build? You've got $325 billion of CAPEX. And it's been reiterated. So whether it's been Sunder Pichai, whether it's been Satya Nadella, they're all planning to spend. And I genuinely believe, Sylvia, that the companies with, you know, the big operating leverage are going to look at this pullback as the moment to build AI infrastructure out. Because when we come out of this, and we will come out of this, there will be deals made. Calling that on the record right now. It may be a tough couple of months. When deals are made, we will see the economy accelerate. And those companies want to build the future and have that AI infrastructure in place. So the Googles and the Microsofts and the Amazons, they're going to buy Nvidia. Um, and one other thing, if I, if I may, I find it very interesting that everybody thinks that China and their push to build Huawei is going to be so successful. When AMD came out with a competitive product, no one believed they could build the software. Broadcom's making chips for the hyperscalers and everyone said, well, that's great, but they don't have CUDA. So it's not going to work as well. But suddenly, everybody believes that China and Huawei is going to build the CUDA competitive product that's going to undo Nvidia? I believe in China, I believe in their resolve. I don't believe that they have as much competition or much competitive capability today as people are suggesting.\nU.S. markets fell sharply Wednesday, with chip stocks leading the retreat as U.S.-China trade tensions spooked investors.

Yet this had less to do with its own operations, and more to do with a move by a business in which it's invested. That decline was steeper than even the gloomy S&P 500 index's 2.2% fall on the day.\nIn an article published this morning and citing an unnamed \"person familiar with the matter,\" Bloomberg wrote that leading artificial intelligence (AI) company OpenAI is in active talks to acquire another privately held AI business called Windsurf. The deal's price tag is rumored to be around $3 billion. \nWhile OpenAI is a separate entity from Microsoft, the tech giant has invested considerably in the company. It also uses its technology in a number of its products. \nIf a deal is reached at anywhere near the mentioned price, it would be OpenAI's priciest acquisition in its relatively short history. Windsurf is a developer of AI-assisted coding tools, which streamline the coding process by allowing users to use natural-language prompts to create programs.\nNeither OpenAI nor Windsurf had commented on the Bloomberg report. Microsoft had also kept mum on the matter.\nOf course any acquisition OpenAI makes doesn't directly affect Microsoft. The company has said, however, that it is entitled to share of profit distributions from OpenAI. Investors might feel that OpenAI -- and by extension, Microsoft -- is better off spending billions of dollars to continue developing still-fresh AI technology rather than a bolt-on acquisition.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

The firm maintained its Overweight rating on the stock, with the revised target implying a potential upside of more than 22% from the prior closing price.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nIn a note to clients, analysts at Morgan Stanley said Microsoft shares have lagged behind peers in the large-cap software sector amid a wall of worry over macroeconomic and operational challenges. Slowing momentum in core segments such as Azure and Microsoft 365 was flagged as a key factor behind the downgrade.\nThe analysts projected Azure revenue growth of 31% in constant currency for the March quarter, down from earlier expectations of a stronger rebound in the second half. They now expect further deceleration of 100 basis points in the June quarter. Growth forecasts for Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud were also revised downward to 13.5% for the third quarter from a prior estimate of 14%, with the team attributing the slowdown to muted adoption of Copilot and lengthening sales cycles.\nFeedback from Microsoft's channel partners pointed to continued execution issues and a more cautious approach by customers toward large-scale technology investments, Morgan Stanley said. The firm also anticipates further downside risk to consensus earnings estimates, projecting a 1.4% reduction in forecasts for fiscal year 2025 and a 5.1% decline for fiscal year 2026.\nDespite these near-term challenges, Morgan Stanley emphasized that the company's long-term positioning in generative artificial intelligence remains solid. The analysts believe Microsoft shares are approaching a valuation floor and see the long-term risk-reward as favorable, estimating a 3-to-1 upside-to-downside ratio at current levels.\nAdditionally, the note highlighted that every 1% decrease in capital expenditures could result in a 1.5% increase in free cash flow, potentially offsetting some of the pressure from softer demand trends.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\nWithin the largest companies in the sector, the players least affected by China risk are Alphabet and Meta Platforms.\nWhile analysts remain bullish overall on Amazon (AMZ) stock, several Wall Street firms have cut their price targets for the tech giant's shares ahead of its first quarter earnings report.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025.\nOn April 4, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives appeared on CNBC to discuss the potential impact of current tariffs and compared the situation to an economic armageddon. If the current tariffs remain in place, Ives thinks it would lead to a 15% to 20% demand reduction across the board. He thinks that investor anxiety is much higher considering how things were in the March 2020 COVID-19 crash earlier. The analyst thinks that investors should now focus on the likelihood of tariff adjustments from comments about negotiations, the impact on consumer-focused companies, and the potential for demand destruction. He even thinks that companies may refuse to provide guidance in the first-quarter earnings calls due to the persistent tariff uncertainty.\nIves thinks that a lot of tech companies will not be able to absorb high tariff increases and rather this cost will be passed on to the consumers which will lead to significant margin erosion and even potential sales declines. He indicated that tech stocks are currently pricing in a 10% to 15% cut to numbers. He suggests that investors should now look at companies with strong long-term potential as he believes earnings may normalize in 2025 and 2026. The analyst also addressed the defensive performance of defense contractors. While acknowledging the relative stability here, Ives cautioned that even these even such sectors are not immune to tariffs. He noted the significant foreign component, specifically 40% to 50% in some instances, in hardware and other sectors.\nWe sifted through the financial media reports to compile a list of the top NASDAQ stocks to buy for 2025. We then selected the 13 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 317\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) develops and supports software, services, devices, and solutions. One of its main businesses is its Productivity and Business Processes segment. It offers Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, office 365 Security & Compliance, Microsoft Viva, and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Its products are sold through OEMs, distributors, and resellers.\nOn March 31, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reaffirmed a Buy rating on the company but lowered the price target from $550 to $500. While this sentiment came from software sector adjustments in general, the firm is confident in the company’s ability to capitalize on the expanding AI sector. Brent Thill believes that the company’s integration of AI into Azure and Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud will significantly help its growth.\nMicrosoft Corp.’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI platform helps it accelerate the development of advanced AI models and is called the Azure AI Foundry. It gained over 200,000 monthly active users within just 2 months of its launch. Similarly, the company also offers Copilot Studi0 which creates personalized AI agents. It helped 160,000 organizations create 400,000 agents in 3 months.\nColumbia Seligman Global Technology Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q4 2024 investor letter, believing that Oracle is positioned to capitalize on the AI-driven cloud demand:\n“Within software, the fund maintained an underweight position to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which proved beneficial as share price for the company fell during the fourth quarter. Microsoft’s outlook for its Azure business came down slightly, which hampered the stock price at times during the quarter and, combined with losses on the Open AI business, led to a disappointing end to 2024. The company has guided its capital expenditure spending up slightly and investors continue to wait for additional monetization from the company’s large commitment to AI infrastructure spending. The fund continued to hold an overweight allocation to Oracle as we believe Oracle is positioned to be a major beneficiary of the AI rollout and has the potential to compete with other large cloud providers, such as Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft. Oracle shares moved lower during the quarter and the stock suffered its worst day of the year in December, as the company narrowly underperformed analysts’ average estimates. Oracle’s business model remains strong as demand for computer power that can handle AI is increasing and the company’s revenues from its cloud infrastructure unit moved higher year over year.”\nOverall, MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy so far in 2025. While we acknowledge the growth potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

The messages, often between Zuckerberg and other top Meta executives, painted a picture of an executive who was paranoid about his rivals and willing to buy competitors whenever possible.\nThe FTC is seeking to force Meta to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that the two acquisitions have given Meta an illegal monopoly over parts of the social networking industry. Emails and documents presented at trial show that Meta, then called Facebook Inc., struggled to compete in the mobile app boom in the early 2010s, buying up successful competitors. The FTC said Meta bought the companies to eliminate direct competitive threats.\nMultiple Competitors\nZuckerberg and Meta’s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Meta faces a wide array of competitors that fight for user attention, including ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, Google’s YouTube, Apple Inc.’s iMessage and Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that TikTok, in particular, posed a “highly urgent” competitive threat when it sprang up in 2018.\n“We observed that our growth slowed down dramatically,” as TikTok gained popularity, Zuckerberg said Wednesday. “It was highly urgent, this has been a top priority for the company for several years.” Meta eventually rolled out a direct competitor, called Reels, that now drives a significant amount of video traffic for the company.\nZuckerberg was at times vague over his three days in court, and regularly disputed the FTC’s interpretations of his prior emails. As a leader, the way he communicated with staff was often blunt or harsh, and he spent time on the stand trying to add more nuance to what was written by his younger self. He occasionally clashed with the FTC’s lead lawyer, Daniel Matheson, who objected at one point that Zuckerberg wasn’t answering his questions.\nWhat’s unclear is how much weight those emails will ultimately have as US District Judge James Boasberg, who is presiding over the case, makes his decision. Meta has argued that the intent behind the purchases doesn’t matter, only whether those deals lead to consumer harm, which it disputes.\nBoasberg previously said the FTC will have a difficult time. Despite allowing the bulk of the case to proceed last November, Boasberg struck a skeptical tone about the FTC’s chances at trial. “Prevailing here, however, does not obscure the fact that the Commission faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial,” the judge said. “Indeed, its positions at times strain this country’s creaking antitrust precedents to their limits.”\nBoasberg also said in a ruling shortly before the trial that the FTC must prove Meta is harming competition in the present day.\nSheryl Sandberg, the company’s former chief operating officer, followed Zuckerberg on the witness stand, facing sharp questioning from FTC lawyer Susan Musser.\nIf the FTC prevails, a spinoff of Instagram and WhatsApp would undo years of integration between the apps, disrupt two of the most popular digital consumer products in the world and potentially erase hundreds of billions of dollars in Meta’s market value. It would also raise serious questions about how the government evaluates and approves deals because the government allowed the transactions to go through at the time.\n‘Network Effects’\nPart of the FTC’s case involves the technical concept of “network effects,” meaning that the more users a company like Meta has, the more likely they are to retain a dominant position, because people are unlikely to switch to a service used by few people.\nBoasberg has remained largely silent during the questioning, but interjected during Zuckerberg’s testimony Wednesday to ask if network effects still really matter.\n“How much does it matter if your friends are on a particular platform if you can send content out of that platform? Why does it matter if your friends are there?” the judge said.\nZuckerberg said it doesn’t. “These apps now serve primarily as discovery engines,” he said. “People can take that content to messaging engines.”\nBigger Company\nUnder questioning by Meta lawyer, Mark Hansen, Zuckerberg refuted the FTC’s argument that Meta bought Instagram to bury a competitor. Instagram would not likely have been able to grow to the extent it has had it remained independent, he said. “Instagram has been built out into a much more vibrant service” as a result of the deal, Zuckerberg said.\nTaking a small online platform to a billion users and beyond is unlikely to happen without the backing of a larger company, he said. “Every company that has this level of scale is owned by a bigger company,” he said, citing TikTok and YouTube as examples.\nEarlier in the trial, it was revealed that Snap Inc.’s Evan Spiegel turned down a $6 billion acquisition offer from Facebook in 2013 for its Snapchat app. Zuckerberg said that the app would have grown more rapidly had it joined his company.\nZuckerberg sought to walk back some statements that he made in previous internal communications. He acknowledged that he sent a 2013 email saying that Facebook blocked advertising for messaging apps WeChat, Kakao and Line, in which he wrote the apps were “trying to build social networks to replace us.” On the stand this week, however, he said “it’s hard for me to characterize what their intent was.”\nMatheson also sought to show that Meta was aware of its antitrust risk years ago, including a possible breakup.\nHe displayed an email from 2018 in which Zuckerberg suggested that Meta should consider spinning off Instagram into a standalone company. “As calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway,” he wrote.\nAt one point, Zuckerberg was asked by Hansen to describe how he was evaluating the competitive threat posed by Instagram and others at the time of the deals. He referenced a quote from former Intel Corp. CEO Andy Grove: “Only the paranoid survive.”\n(Updates with color on Zuckerberg testimony starting in the first paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nTrump's trade war is causing all sorts of extreme dislocations in market and economic sentiment.\n(Bloomberg) -- Shale fracker Liberty Energy Inc. posted its worst earnings in three years amid plunging oil prices and mounting concerns about energy demand.Most Read from BloombergTrump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office SpaceHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?Why the Best Bike Lanes Always Get BlamedLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal CostsDOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on LeaveAdjusted first-quarter profit fell to 4 cen\nEven in the midst of a sharp drop in his company’s stock price and a freight market that is not supporting the bottom line at Triumph Financial, CEO Aaron Graft touted milestones reached and signaled a new aggressiveness in pricing the company’s products.

Currently the net annual result is approximately $100 million negative for our business,\" CEO William Oplinger said during a post-earnings conference call.  The aluminum producer said the tariffs on Canadian imports had cost the company roughly $20 million in the first quarter, ended March 31.\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors who may have been hoping the Federal Reserve is poised to come to the aid of tariff-rattled markets took away an unwelcome message from the central bank's chief on Wednesday: the Fed may be in a bind.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank would wait for more data on the economy's direction before changing interest rates.  Speaking to the Economic Club of Chicago, he noted that there was a potentially tough situation developing for the Fed in which inflation is pushed higher by tariffs while growth and potentially, employment, weaken.\nChinese online marketplace Temu and fast-fashion retailer Shein, two of the biggest advertisers on U.S. social media, are sharply cutting their U.S. digital ad spending, industry data show, in a blow to tech companies such as Meta's Facebook and YouTube.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against other best golf stocks to buy according to analysts.\nGolf stocks are publicly traded firms that are part of the golf industry. These companies include businesses that manufacture golf equipment, operate golf courses, and provide associated services, giving investors a chance to engage in the golf market.\nThe golf industry continues to evolve with women, social play, lessons, and online bookings driving key developments. According to a report by NBC Sports Next, female engagement has grown by 15%, with 800,000 more women golfers joining between 2020 and 2022, compared to a 2% rise among male golfers. Women now account for one-third of junior players and 49% of surveyed golfers. Golf remains a strongly social activity, with 49% of surveyed golfers primarily playing with friends. Business-related golf is also growing, notably among GolfNow users. While 36% of golfers took a lesson in the previous year, the number rose to 67% among GolfNow customers, with many preferring a combination of on-course and facility-based training. Moreover, younger golfers are frequently booking online, with 43% of those aged 18 to 34 reserving at least one round by 2023. Speed and convenience are essential, with 55% citing online booking as the quickest option. These developments point out expansion prospects for courses that cater to women, social golfers, and digitally aware players.\nAccording to the National Golf Foundation’s research, the golf business in the United States is still expanding rapidly, with 45 million Americans (aged 6 and up) playing golf in 2023, including 26.6 million on-course and 18.4 million in off-course venues like simulators and Topgolf. The business has seen nearly 2 million new golfers each year for the past ten years, with 3.4 million first-time players projected in 2023 alone. The largest consumer age group is still young adults (18-34 years old), with 6.3 million participants on the course and 5.8 million off. Since 2019, juniors (3.5 million) have shot up by 40%, with girls accounting for 37%. Female involvement has climbed to 7 million, making up 26% of on-course golfers. In 2023, rounds played reached a record high of 531 million, beating the pre-pandemic average by more than 10%. The US offers 16,000 courses at 14,000 facilities, with 75% open to the public. Despite a 12% drop in course supply since 2006, demand remains high, with 22.4 million people expressing a desire to play.\nFinally, TGL, the golf league that began playing matches in January 2025, is combining digital and physical components to create an entirely new hybrid golf experience. Teams of golfers compete in a specially created venue across a set of custom-made holes. They begin by hitting a large-screen simulator of real terrain, then shift to a transformable turntable as the green. Broadcasting innovations aimed at bringing golfers’ experiences closer to home viewers were deemed crucial from the start. The 2025 PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando showcased the golf industry’s strong momentum.\nMarc Simon, Vice President of PGA Golf Exhibitions, stated:\n“The show is a reflection of the industry, and golf is thriving right now,” “With the surging popularity of golf, we saw the largest number of exhibitors and largest occupied space since 2009, which is encouraging to see.”\nThe exhibition included over 1,000 exhibitors spread across 1.1 million square feet, showcasing golf’s continuous development in the $102 billion industry. More than 1,200 VIP buyers from 770 golf courses and mass merchandisers attended, totaling $810 million in purchasing power and roughly $2 billion in retail sales potential. The event has progressed beyond typical golf equipment and gear to include fitness, health, and wellness areas, as well as racquet sports and club facilities. The Clubhouse exhibition space was doubled in size, mirroring the trend in golf facilities toward broader member experiences.\nTechnology was a major focus, with AI-powered golf simulators, effective ball-flight data, and next-generation golf carts catering to growing personal cart ownership. Golf’s trends are shifting, with a record 200 influencers in attendance and robust clothing growth fueled by Gen Z consumers. The PGA Show’s reinvention is in line with industry trends, stressing experiential marketing and innovation. Looking ahead, organizers intend to continue responding to changing company needs in order to ensure long-term industry success.\nA team of trainers and athletes displaying a wide range of athletic and casual footwear.\nFor this list, we compiled an initial list of 12 golf stocks, which included companies that are involved in the golf industry. Then, we selected the 10 stocks that had the highest upside potential as of April 9, 2025. We have only included stocks in our list with an upside potential of 10% or higher. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the upside potential.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nAnalysts’ Upside Potential as of April 9: 52.04%\nNIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is among the Best Golf Stocks. It is a global athletic clothing and footwear corporation. While it is not a large player in the golf equipment market, it does provide a diverse line of golf clothes and footwear, including shoes and clothing tailored for comfort and style on the course. Its golf products are connected with well-known golfers such as Rory McIlroy and have received widespread recognition for their quality and performance attributes. However, other sports, such as basketball, jogging, and soccer, continue to receive wide attention.\nThe company’s business in China, a vital market, has struggled due to the economic downturn and increased competition from local businesses. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)’s CEO, Elliott Hill, focuses on restoring the brand’s core identity: sport and the athlete, with a particular focus on rebuilding relationships with retailers and promoting innovation.\nThe business aims to reconnect with players and sports fans by highlighting the brand’s genuine connection to the sport. It intends to relaunch its product lineup through innovation, ensuring that its offerings are not only in line with present trends but also far ahead of the curve in terms of performance and design. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) introduced several new items, including the Peg Premium and Vomero 18, which gained excellent consumer feedback. The new 24/7 apparel collection outperformed sales projections, showing successful footwear and apparel innovation.\nHill admits that NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has relied too heavily on promotions to drive sales and intends to transition to a full-price model in its online business while actively eliminating outdated inventory through less profitable channels.\nOverall, NKE ranks 2nd on our list of the 10 best golf stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of golf companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nTariffs are rattling markets and leading to spikes in volatility. Growth-focused sectors like technology and consumer discretionary are particularly vulnerable given their cyclicality and global exposure.\nApple (AAPL -3.82%) and Nike (NKE -2.14%) are down over 20% year to date at the time of this writing, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, which are also down significantly. Here's why both stocks are selling off and whether they are worth buying now.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThere's no sugarcoating Apple's exposure to tariffs, especially in China. China is a key market for Apple -- both from a manufacturing and a sales perspective.\nAfter Apple stock surged on April 9 in response to a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs to all countries except China, it sank 4% the following day on news that the tariff rate on Chinese goods would be raised to a staggering 145%. If it sticks, that steep of a tariff rate would crush Apple's near-term profitability. That's why the stock is down so much year to date.\n\n^SPX data by YCharts\nBuying Apple stock now is a belief that two things will happen:\nOn April 10, reports indicated that Apple was flying iPhones from India to the U.S. to circumnavigate tariffs on China. If Apple feels China could be a longer-term risk, it could work to permanently shift manufacturing out of China toward India and other partners in Southeast Asia. However, investors may want to wait for Apple's upcoming earnings call on May 1 to better understand how the company plans to reduce the tariff impact.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nAs for Apple's pricing power, iPhone growth has slowed in recent years. But the company has made up for some of that slowdown by growing its high-margin services segment and repurchasing stock to grow earnings per share. Entertainment services include Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, Apple Books, and more. Apple also has a growing list of financial services, from Apple Pay to Apple Card and Apple Cash.\nApple has yet to make as big a splash in artificial intelligence as some investors may have hoped for, so there are fears that it lacks the pricing power it once had. However, services have enhanced the breadth of the Apple ecosystem.\nAll told, Apple stands out as a solid buy if you believe in its ability to navigate supply chain challenges and its pricing power. But it's also reasonable to take a wait-and-see approach until investors get more clarity on Apple's response to tariffs from the earnings call in a few weeks.\nNike's year-to-date losses are even more alarming, considering it was already one of the worst-performing components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year. Nike has sold off so much that it is now hovering around its lowest level in a decade.\nThe abridged version of Nike's problems is that it overly invested in switching the business away from wholesale partnerships to digital, which worked during the pandemic but proved a costly error in recent years, as the direct-to-consumer segment has been underperforming wholesale and Nike's brick-and-mortar stores. In addition to management blunders, Nike has been hit hard by formidable competition from Adidas and newer players like On Holding and Deckers Outdoor-owned Hoka.\nTariffs throw yet another wrench in the Nike investment thesis at a time when the company was already licking its wounds from past mistakes. Reports indicate that Nike makes 95% of its shoes in China, Vietnam, and Indonesia. China is a key market for Nike's sales as well.\nFor the nine months ended Feb. 28, Greater China sales were $5.11 billion compared to $14.87 billion in North America and $9.26 billion in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. During that period, Nike sold more footwear, apparel, and equipment in Greater China than the rest of Asia Pacific and Latin America combined -- with Greater China making up a significant 15.1% of total Nike Brand revenue during that nine-month period.\nLike Apple, buying Nike stock now is a bet on the power of its brand, that it can turn the business around, handle competition, and pivot its supply chain. However, Nike is arguably more vulnerable than Apple, considering the business was already in the middle of a turnaround before the onset of trade tensions.\nNike has gone from a growth stock to a dividend-paying value stock. Despite its struggles, the company has continued to buy back stock and has 23 consecutive years of dividend raises. The sell-off in the stock price has pushed Nike's yield up to a 10-year high of 2.8% and its price-to-earnings ratio down to a 10-year low of just 18. Although if tariffs stick around, Nike's earnings will almost certainly fall in the near term -- making its valuation less appealing.\nApple and Nike may operate in entirely different industries, but the buy case for both companies is similar. Both face serious tariff risks, and neither company has been growing earnings at breakneck rates in recent years. However, these are two top brands whose valuations could look cheap in hindsight if they can endure this challenging period.\nApple stands out as the safer all-around play, whereas Nike has a higher risk and potential reward if it can turn the business around and navigate tariffs. Both stocks could be worth buying now if you have a long-term horizon. However, it's also reasonable to keep both stocks on a watch list and wait for upcoming earnings calls for more clarity on their strategies, given we are sailing through uncharted waters.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.\nThe market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump’s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year.\nThe year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios.\nIn the second month of 2025, the US government’s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States’ tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services.\nDW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods & services in the latest round of “Trump Tariffs”. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering “continuous stagflation”, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment.\nThis scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children’s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children’s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President & CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing:\n“Make sure that money can be talked about, that there’s no taboos…so that your children are learning those really good financial literacy skills that they need to set themselves up for success for the rest of their life.”\nInvesting in the markets for your children’s future has the advantage of time. In a report by MorningStar, investments in stocks have the added benefit of compounding return, which means the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to grow exponentially. CNBC reported on billionaire investor Mark Cuban and how he made billions from his first few million with a long-term view on his investments.\nTo compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources and gathered the stocks they collectively favored. These stocks have a long-standing history of performance, with strong balance sheets and sound financials. Then, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database of billionaire stock holdings to arrive at our list of 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires as of Q4 2024. For the stocks with the same number of billionaire holdings, we have used the total value of billionaire holdings as a secondary metric to rank the stocks. Billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of trainers and athletes displaying a wide range of athletic and casual footwear.\nNo. of Billionaires: 14\nValue of total Investment by Billionaires: $3.095 billion\nNIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a global leader in the athletic goods industry. The company designs, develops, markets, and sells a wide range of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services worldwide under prominent brands such as NIKE, Jumpman, Converse, and Chuck Taylor. These brands are considered household names for both children & parents/ adults alike.\nIn the Q3 2025 earnings report, NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) revenue was $11.27 billion, down 9.33% YoY, although beating analyst estimates by $231.5 million. EPS was $0.54, also beating estimates by $0.25. The company attributes the decline in sales to rising inflation, high tariffs but remains a market leader in high-quality athletic goods. It is among the best kid-friendly stocks to invest in.\nRecent declines in international markets such as the Middle East, Europe, and Asia (including China & Vietnam) were the result of reduced buying by price-conscious consumers. As per the United States International Trade Commission (USITC), China is the largest importer of shoes from the United States at 37%, while Vietnam is responsible for 29.8%. China was hit with the aforementioned 34% trade tariffs, while Vietnam was hit even harder with 46%. This is likely to further impact NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE)’s overall revenue figure. Experts consider these conditions as an optimal time to invest in the stock to take advantage of the lower price.\nOverall, NKE ranks 6th on our list of best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of NKE, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Despite this launch, Nike's share price dipped 2.2% over the past week, a movement contrasting with the broader market’s 5.8% gain. This slight decline in Nike's price might not align with the broader market trend influenced by external factors, such as overall market optimism from major tech stocks rallying on tariff exemption news, which appeared to influence broader market sentiment more positively.\nBuy, Hold or Sell NIKE? View our complete analysis and fair value estimate and you decide.\nFind companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value.\nThe recent collaboration between Nike and Kool-Aid, featuring the vibrant Nike x Kool-Aid Ja 2 sneaker, may add fresh appeal to Nike's product lineup. This partnership aligns with Nike's strategy to enhance brand storytelling and leverage sports performance dimensions as growth drivers. Although the share price fell 2.2% recently, this may be a short-term fluctuation possibly reflecting external market conditions rather than an immediate impact of the collaboration. Over a longer period of five years, Nike's total shareholder return, which includes share price and dividends, was a decline of 34.31%, underscoring challenges the company has faced in maintaining upward momentum.\nCompared to the past year, Nike's performance has lagged behind both the US Market and the broader Luxury industry, which are indicators of the competitive and economic pressures it encounters. Analysts predict a modest revenue growth of around 1.9% annually, alongside a slight increase in profit margins to 9.9% within three years. However, for Nike to meet the consensus price target of US$78.49, the stock would need to see a significant increase from its current trading price of US$53.27, indicating a trading discount of about 33.4% against the target. The Kool-Aid collaboration may help boost revenue and support these forecasts by enhancing brand engagement and driving full-price sales, aiding in net margin improvements and inventory turnover.\nEvaluate NIKE's historical performance by accessing our past performance report.\n This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

Many of them provide website URLs and contact details for viewers to order directly from these suppliers. “Why don’t you just contact us and buy from us? You won’t believe the prices we give you,” said one creator selling luxury handbags.\nIn another video, TikTok creator @LunaSourcingChina, stands outside a factory she says makes Lululemon yoga leggings for $5 to $6 even though they retail in the US for more than $100. “The material and craftsmanship are basically the same,” she says.\nA Lululemon spokesperson said the company manufactures about 3% of its finished goods in Mainland China and that authentic products are only available for purchase at Lululemon stores, official websites and authorized partners.\nSome of the most popular videos – many uploaded in March but only gaining traction in recent days – have been amplified by a video titled “China exposed the truth” with 8.3 million views and 492,000 likes, as of Monday morning, New York time. The one that reveals the Chinese supplier to Lululemon garnered 2.6 million views and over 215,000 likes, while a “How we bypass tariffs” clip had close to 1 million views and 118,000 likes.\n“This campaign appears to be a calculated attempt to undermine President Trump’s tariff policy on China by leveraging TikTok to promote Chinese manufacturing as cheaper, more desirable, and accessible—even in defiance of trade restrictions,” said Alex Goldenberg, senior advisor at the Network Contagion Research Institute at Rutgers University.\nWhile it’s unclear how ordering directly from Chinese suppliers would allow consumers to sidestep the tariff — the duty waiver for small parcels that are sent to American homes is also being scrapped from May 2 — the videos are aimed at undermining the White House narrative that the economic measures are in Americans’ interest.\nThe levy on Chinese exports is now 145%, while Trump has paused additional tariffs on other countries for 90 days.\nThe flood of posts also reflects the increased effectiveness of Chinese creators at reaching into the daily lives of ordinary Americans. TikTok’s algorithm, and its ability to influence what information millions of US users see, is one of the main driving forces behind US government efforts to force its Chinese owner ByteDance Ltd. to relinquish control of its international operations. TikTok didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOther Chinese social media apps like Xiaohongshu, or Red Note, have also gained popularity among young US users amid uncertainty around access to TikTok.\n“These posts are much more confrontational and mocking of the US, rather than showing it as a threat,” said Tom Harper, lecturer in Chinese international relations at the University of East London. They follow a wave of AI-generated images depicting Americans working on assembly lines, Harper added.\nSome of the videos directly criticize US trade policies and call on American citizens to take action.\n“For decades your government and oligarchs ship your jobs to China, not for diplomacy, not for peace, but to exploit cheap labor and in the process, they hollow out your middle class, crash your working class and told you to be proud while they sold your future for profit,” user @neil778027 said in a video. “Americans, you don’t need a tariff, you need a revolution.”\nOn Friday, the US announced tariff exemptions on a range of Chinese products including electronics, computers and semiconductors, although it’s not known how long these exceptions will apply. Regardless, they will not affect most of the goods exported by China to the US, including the clothing and accessories produced by Chinese suppliers featured in the TikTok videos.\nMany European high-end luxury brands are also featured, but the makers of the videos don’t explain why they are featuring European brands in their pushback against the US.\nAnother key question raised by the videos is whether the factories have non-disclosure agreements with their international clients and how the videos will potentially affect long-standing business relationships between brands and their manufacturers.\nCameron Johnson, senior partner at Shanghai-based consultancy Tidalwave Solutions, who recently visited the Chinese trading hub of Yiwu, sees it as part of a fundamental shift in purchasing practices for China.\n“In the past, you might use a middleman or a trading company to source your products for your deal with quality control or go visit the factory, establish those relationships, and then maybe you would come on occasion,” he told Bloomberg TV. “But now what we’re seeing is just a complete democratization of sourcing products.”\n--With assistance from Annabelle Droulers, Daniela Wei, Zheping Huang and Omar El Chmouri.\n(Adds comment in seventh paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nCheap Consumer Goods Are the American Dream, Actually\nWorld Travelers Are Rethinking Vacation Plans to the US\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nNike Inc.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: \nUBS upgraded HubSpot (HUBS) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $675, down from $775. The firm cites valuation for the upgrade with the shares down 35% since mid-February\nBarclays upgraded Autoliv (ALV) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $97, down from $110. With the firm's recommendations shifting to a more defensive positioning, it believes Autoliv can relatively outperform the sector.\nHSBC upgraded KKR (KKR) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $119, down from $170. The firm says that despite heightened macro uncertainty, it sees opportunities.\nNeedham upgraded Neurocrine (NBIX) to Buy from Hold with a $138 price target. The firm cites its positive physician survey on Crenessity's ramp in congenital adrenal hyperplasia for the upgrade.\nBofA upgraded DuPont (DD) to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $75, down from $88. While the firm does see earnings risks to DuPont from trade disruptions, it views the near 30% pullback in the shares in the last two months as excessive. BofA also upgraded Westlake (WLK) to Buy from Neutral.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nBarclays downgraded General Motors (GM) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $40, down from $70. The downgrade of GM reflects the company's \"significant risk\" to near-term earnings from tariffs.\nBofA downgraded PepsiCo (PEP) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $155, down from $185. Frito-Lay North America's growth is likely to remain below long-term trendline this year and while international segments are scaling and making large contributions to sales and profit growth, it's not enough at this point to make up for slower growth at the North American snacks segment, the firm tells investors.\nBarclays downgraded Mobileye (MBLY) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $14, down from $22. The downgrade of Mobileye reflects its thesis that auto tech is at risk of a slower uptake.\nBaird downgraded Universal Health (UHS) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $224, down from $274. The firm sees minimal incremental buyers of stocks in the managed care and healthcare facilities group until the policy overhang clears. Baird also downgraded Tenet Healthcare (THC), Molina Healthcare (MOH), Elevance Health (ELV) and HCA Healthcare (HCA) to Neutral from Outperform.\nWells Fargo downgraded Howmet Aerospace (HWM) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $118, down from $132. The firm cut estimates across the aerospace group, as it thinks a global economic slowdown hits both original equipment makers and the aftermarket. Wells also downgraded Hexcel (HXL) to Equal Weight from Overweight.\nTop 5 Initiations: \nBerenberg initiated coverage of Nike (NKE) with a Hold rating and $58 price target. Within sporting goods, the firm favors incumbents over \"challenger brands\" given their \"deep\" franchise values which underpin the long-term sustainability of returns.\nBenchmark initiated coverage of MercadoLibre (MELI) with a Buy rating and $2,500 price target. MercadoLibre \"stands out as a dominant regional leader in the global e-commerce setting,\" says the firm.\nPiper Sandler initiated coverage of RxSight (RXST) with a Neutral rating and $18 price target. The firm likes the company's novel light adjustable lens technology and that it plays in the \"massive\" innovative intraocular lens marketplace, but is taking a \"wait-and-see approach.\"\nCiti reinstated coverage of Omnicom (OMC) and Interpublic Group (IPG) with Buy ratings and price targets of $103 and $35, respectively. U.S. tariffs will likely hurt U.S. advertising spending, but the firm finds both stocks \"very compelling\" even with the tariff impact.\nNeedham initiated coverage of Aurora Innovation (AUR) with a Buy rating and $10 price target. The firm says the company is positioned to leverage its Aurora Driver platform and industry partnerships to create the market for autonomous trucking on U.S. highways. \nPresident Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on some tariffs.

On the morning of the 9th, Trump posted on social media that it was a “great time to buy.” About four hours later, he announced he was suspending tariffs, propelling the S&P 500 index to a 9.5% gain, its biggest rally since 2008.\nGreene’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nGreene, one of the first lawmakers to file a disclosure since Trump announced his tariffs, is an active trader in stocks, filing eight disclosures so far this year. She’s been particularly bullish on the semiconductor and tech industries. Her sale of Treasuries, though, was the first time she’s sold after buying more than $500,000 of the government-backed securities since the beginning of 2025.\nCongressional Democrats have urged investigations into whether people connected to Trump profited from the timing of the tariff announcements.\nIn a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she did not know which officials may have had advance knowledge, but called it “unconscionable” that insiders may have profited from the market volatility.\nThe disclosure reports only require members to list values of transactions in broad ranges, and do not contain specific times of execution or cost basis, so it’s unclear precisely how many of Greene’s trades happened before Trump broke the news of the tariff pause.\nBut at least $11,011 to $165,000 in purchases came on April 8. As of 11:20 a.m. Tuesday in New York, shares of Blackstone, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Tesla traded higher than at any point on that day.\nOver the two days, her stock purchases totaled $21,021 to $315,000. She sold $50,001 to $100,000 of US Treasuries on April 8.\nAmong the other names in Greene’s purchases were chipmakers Nvidia Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., along with apparel companies Lululemon Athletica Inc. and Nike Inc.\n(Updates with Greene’s trading history in fifth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nThe chairman of the Federal Reserve has warned that Donald Trump’s trade war will fuel inflation and keep interest rates higher for longer, triggering a steep sell-off on Wall Street.\nLululemon (LULU) has received quite a bit of attention from Zacks.com users lately.

Currently the net annual result is approximately $100 million negative for our business,\" CEO William Oplinger said during a post-earnings conference call.  The aluminum producer said the tariffs on Canadian imports had cost the company roughly $20 million in the first quarter, ended March 31.\nThe stock market has been crashing this year and if you're a long-term investor, it can be a good time to invest in companies at discounted valuations.

The global sportswear icon has been leading the industry for decades. It's a well-known consumer brand that has a presence virtually all over the world. People have recognized the business as having strength in product innovation and marketing.\nBut these strengths haven't prevented the consumer discretionary stock from tanking. As of this writing (April 12), it trades 69% below its record high. Nike's winning culture has been replaced by a losing track record due to ongoing challenges.\nIt's still hard to ignore the current dip, which might present a rare buying opportunity. If you're taking a closer look at Nike stock, know that adding the company to your portfolio is only a brilliant move if you believe one thing.\nInvestors seem to be avoiding Nike shares. This is clearly evident by looking at the valuation. They sell at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.1, which is basically their cheapest level in 10 years. Value investors are paying attention.\nThe stock's disappointing performance is warranted. Nike's revenue is declining. It generated $11.3 billion in sales in the third quarter of 2025 (ended Feb. 28), down 9% year over year. The leadership team expects a mid-teens percentage drop in the current fiscal quarter. This is happening at the same time that Nike's competitors continue to grow their top lines.\nUncharacteristically, Nike has struggled to release fresh new products to keep customers excited. And it prioritized digital sales at the expense of its third-party retailing partners. \nTariffs aren't helping this situation, either. Nike produces nearly all of its shoes in Vietnam, China, and Indonesia, countries that have high levies placed on products coming from them. We don't know how things will ultimately play out. However, Nike's margins could take a hit, or its customers could see higher prices. Neither of these scenarios will boost investor confidence.\nBuying Nike stock is a brilliant move, in the face of current headwinds, only if you think earnings per share (EPS) will be higher in the next five years. This requires, first and foremost, for revenue to start growing again. The leadership team mentioned that things should stabilize after Q4 2025.\nNonetheless, it's extremely difficult to predict when EPS will bottom out. Getting to mid-single-digit revenue gains and improving profitability will help.\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates expect EPS to rise at a compound annual rate of 15% between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2027. The best-case scenario is for the double-digit gains to continue after this forecast period. The idea is that the stock price should mimic the trajectory of bottom-line performance. It will require a lot of patience from investors.\nNike deserves credit. It's the leader in the global market for sportswear. It has one of the most powerful brands on the face of the planet. Its worldwide presence gives it unmatched visibility. And while its challenges are hard to ignore, the business generated $48 billion in revenue in the past 12 months. Nike isn't going away anytime soon.\nLow expectations (from the cheap P/E ratio) mixed with higher EPS five years from now can result in a fantastic outcome for investors. The question of buying the stock ultimately comes down to whether you believe management can successfully execute a turnaround by highlighting the brand in the eyes of consumers, releasing exciting new products, and making sure it's striking the right balance between wholesale and direct distribution channels.\nThe risk is high. But so is the potential reward. \n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Nike, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against other mid- and large-cap stocks insiders are buying after Trump’s tariff rollout.\nOn April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump declared “Liberation Day” and signed Executive Order 14257, imposing a baseline 10% tariff on nearly all U.S. imports, effective April 5. Higher tariffs—ranging from 11% to 50%—were scheduled for 57 countries and territories, including the European Union, China, and Japan. These increased rates were set to begin April 9 but were postponed for 90 days, with the exception of China, which continued to face elevated tariffs.\nIn April, some insiders took advantage of the dip to buy shares, while others chose to sell. Analyzing insider trading can provide valuable insights: purchases often signal confidence in the company’s future, while sales may reflect personal or diversification choices. Therefore, insider trading should be evaluated in the context of the company’s financial health and overall market conditions.\nToday, we’re focusing on stocks that insiders are buying in April. Using Insider Monkey’s insider trading screener, we identified 19 mid- and large-cap companies where at least one insider bought shares between April 2 and April 14. From this list, we ranked the top 19 stocks based on the highest value of insider purchases during this period.\nOur research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds, focusing on insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of trainers and athletes displaying a wide range of athletic and casual footwear.\nMarket Cap: $81.79 billion\nNIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a globally recognized and popular brand that designs, markets, and sells athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment under names like NIKE, Converse, and Jumpman. Its products are sold through retail stores, digital platforms, and independent distributors around the world. It is also one of the 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Nike (NYSE:NKE) reported $11.3 billion in revenue, a 9% decline from the previous year. Gross margin also fell by 330 basis points, reaching 41.5%. Wholesale revenues were $6.2 billion, down 7% on a reported basis and down 4% on a currency-neutral basis year-over-year. Net income was $800 million, down 32%, and diluted earnings per share was $0.54, a decrease of 30%.\nOn April 4, one insider, a director at Nike, Holmes Robert Swan acquired $502,756 worth of Nike shares at an average price of $58.46 per share. With this purchase of 8,600 shares, Swan increased his holdings to 31,983 shares.\nAccording to the 32 analysts, Nike (NYSE:NKE) stock is a “Moderate Buy” with a price target of $86.19 per share. The average price target suggests a potential upside of 55.67% from the latest price.\nOverall, NKE ranks 12th on our list of mid- and large-cap stocks insiders are buying after Trump’s tariff rollout. While we acknowledge the potential of NKE, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

So after the chip maker disclosed that it would take a $5.5 billion dollar hit from the US government's surprise new controls on its semiconductor exports to China. For more on the latest, let's welcome now Daniel Newman, Futurum CEO. Daniel, it is great to see you here on set. Appreciate it from Texas. Um, you know, before J. Powell, frankly, this was the story of the day. It was chips, it was Nvidia. Nvidia is down here, Dan. It's not about 10%. It's getting clobbered in today's trade. I guess two, two questions to start. One, Dan, were you surprised by that news when you saw those headlines? And two, do you think down 10%, is that move justified in your opinion?\nYeah, first of all, nobody should have been surprised by this move. Really the administration's been giving the signal that it was going to clamp down. Now, what was interesting is this week, there was a bit of gyration because they cut this deal, they announced 500 billion dollars of AI supercomputers being built here in the United States. And then a day later, he pulls back on this new export licensing requirement.\nThat that, you bring that, Dan. That is an interesting point because there were some folks who thought Jensen Wong was going to be kind of shielded from this. Right?\nThey made a deal. I had a few reporters actually hit me up, do you think there was some tip for tat going on. And first of all, I think Trump needs to show, President Trump needs to show that there is no tip for tat. So whether it's, you know, Tim Cook bringing more manufacturing here, whether it's TSMC coming here. But I actually think on the other side of this, and maybe we come back to this, is that I actually think creating some certainty with the, with the community, the business community, about what type of benefit they can expect by onshoring and bringing manufacturing back here. I think that would be a great start. Having said that, national security, economic security, and AI are tightly correlated. Us giving the chips to China, whether it's the tuned down chips or the best chips coming through intermediaries, which they shouldn't be getting. This is something that's giving an advantaging China. There's a lot of people out there that are like, oh, well, this is going to only push their resolve. Do you think China is waiting because we're sending Nvidia chips, they're not investing in Huawei and building their own chips? You can be absolutely certain that they are. This war, this trade war, is largely being fought on the grounds of long-term economic domination. Long-term economic domination will only be had if we control the technology trade. Nvidia is at the forefront of that trade.\nAnd what do you think of from an investor standpoint? Here you have Nvidia falling yet again, 8 to 10%. You know, look what happened over the last couple days. It had recovered from its lows, right? And a lot of investors who got in short term experienced that bounce. Where, where do you think that looks like this week?\nYeah. I, I look at that line of people around the corner at $150 that just couldn't wait to buy. And you go, what is really changed? Well, first of all, you've got GPUs melting over at, at X and at OpenAI. There's so much demand there. Could Nvidia pivot some of its capacity, not focus so much on building specialized products for China, and make sure we meet all the capacity and demand that's out there for companies that are in the US that are trying to build? You've got $325 billion of CAPEX. And it's been reiterated. So whether it's been Sunder Pichai, whether it's been Satya Nadella, they're all planning to spend. And I genuinely believe, Sylvia, that the companies with, you know, the big operating leverage are going to look at this pullback as the moment to build AI infrastructure out. Because when we come out of this, and we will come out of this, there will be deals made. Calling that on the record right now. It may be a tough couple of months. When deals are made, we will see the economy accelerate. And those companies want to build the future and have that AI infrastructure in place. So the Googles and the Microsofts and the Amazons, they're going to buy Nvidia. Um, and one other thing, if I, if I may, I find it very interesting that everybody thinks that China and their push to build Huawei is going to be so successful. When AMD came out with a competitive product, no one believed they could build the software. Broadcom's making chips for the hyperscalers and everyone said, well, that's great, but they don't have CUDA. So it's not going to work as well. But suddenly, everybody believes that China and Huawei is going to build the CUDA competitive product that's going to undo Nvidia? I believe in China, I believe in their resolve. I don't believe that they have as much competition or much competitive capability today as people are suggesting.\nUNI Europa argues that American digital giants like Amazon benefit from unfair economic advantages in the world’s largest single market and should be dealt with accordingly.\nSNOW and MDB are well-known players in the database management system space.

Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.”\n“For the time being,” Powell said, “we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.”\nStill, there were bright spots.

But the sudden reversal by the Trump administration, after months of policy limbo and back-channel talks, signals another hard turn in trade policy — and lays bare the high-stakes game playing out among Silicon Valley, Washington, and Beijing.\nLet’s rewind: On April 9, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attended a $1-million-a-plate Mar-a-Lago dinner with President Trump, where AI exports were reportedly a topic of conversation. Proceeds from the dinner went to MAGA Inc., a Trump-aligned super PAC that can raise unlimited funds but isn’t allowed to coordinate directly with the campaign. Five days later, on April 14, the U.S. informed Nvidia it would need a license to export H20 chips abroad. On April 16, Nvidia announced the multibillion-dollar charge — and markets flinched.\nMeanwhile, ASML (ASML), the Dutch semiconductor equipment powerhouse, reported first-quarter sales of €7.7 billion — slightly below forecasts — and flagged “greater uncertainty” due to trade tensions. ASML makes the machines essential for cutting-edge chip production, giving it enormous influence over global chip supply. The company warned that new tariffs and tech restrictions could weigh on its outlook for 2025 and 2026.\nInvestors didn’t like what they saw.\nNvidia stock slid 6% at the market open Wednesday and retreated further in the afternoon before closing down about 7%, with AMD (AMD) and other chipmakers falling in tandem. The broader Nasdaq dropped over 3%, as Wall Street reassessed what a prolonged, escalating tech standoff could mean for supply chains, AI development, and the semiconductor industry.\nIn a Wednesday note, Jefferies (JEF) analysts said the H20 ban was expected — but the size of Nvidia’s write-down was not. It signals outsized demand from Chinese buyers, who had reportedly placed $16 billion in H20 orders this year. Still, Jefferies says China has likely stockpiled enough GPUs for ongoing AI training and will increasingly lean on local chips for inferencing tasks.\nMarkets may have priced in some pain, but they haven’t seen the last punch.\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nThe chip maker will take a $5.5 billion charge in the current quarter for H20 inventory and canceled sales.\nAbbott Labs posts first-quarter sales that missed analysts’ estimates but rose 4% from a year earlier.\nWe recently published a list of 13 Best NASDAQ Stocks to Buy So Far in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025. On April 4, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives appeared on CNBC to discuss the potential impact […]\nUnited Airlines offered two sets of profit guidance, depending on whether the U.S. enters a recession.  \"The company's outlook is dependent on the macro environment, which the company believes is impossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence,\" the carrier said.  United shares rose roughly 4% Wednesday morning after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.\nAbbott Laboratories forecasts an impact of \"a few hundred million dollars\" this year from Trump administration tariffs, Chief Executive Robert Ford told analysts Wednesday.  The healthcare company sees the costs starting in the third quarter.  Ford told analysts it is too early to simply double the 2025 estimate for how tariffs might affect Abbott in future years, but the company can cover them in the near term.\nExport restrictions placed on certain chips manufactured by Nvidia have weighed on other chipmakers, and shares of Broadcom, Qualcomm and others declined.\nThe percentage of U.S. credit card accounts past due for 90 days was the highest in 12 years during the fourth quarter, a Philadelphia Federal Reserve report said.\nPresident Donald Trump's turbulent tariff rollout and subsequent pullback have rattled the stock market and confused economists and business leaders.  While some of the most intense tariffs are officially under a 90-day pause, a 10% tariff on most imports is still in effect, as is a hefty 145% import tariff on Chinese goods.  The semiconductor industry has so far avoided the impact of tariffs, which is great news for artificial intelligence leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\nNvidia discloses that sales of its H20 chips to China would require a license ‘for the indefinite future’ from the U.S. Department of Commerce, AMD says a license requirement for chip exports will result in charges of up to $800 million, and ASML issues disappointing sales guidance.\nWith President Donald Trump announcing a wide set of tariffs, there could be increased costs for a range of companies.  Visa (NYSE: V) is a giant in the payments processing space, helping to ensure secure and convenient transactions between vendors and their customers.  The company boasts a solid track record of growing its revenue, net income, and free cash flow, as shown in the table below.\nTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results\nSign in to access your portfolio\n\n\n\nTry again."

Michael received a Bachelor of Arts in literature from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a master's in linguistics from the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellin, Colombia.\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\n Major U.S. equities indexes tumbled Wednesday.\n\n Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told the Economic Club of Chicago that changes in U.S. trade policy could pressure growth and boost inflation. Noting declines in business and consumer sentiment, Powell suggested the Fed is poised to await more visibility on possible tariff impacts before modifying interest rates.\n\n The S&P 500 ended the session 2.2% lower, while the Dow declined 1.7%. Tech sector underperformance weighed on the Nasdaq, which fell 3.1%.\n\n Shares of J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) skidded 7.7%, falling the furthest of any S&P 500 stock, following the logistics company's earnings release. Although first-quarter sales and profits edged out expectations, executives noted that tariffs were weighing on demand as customers attempt to gauge the potential impact on their supply chains and overall businesses. J.B. Hunt stressed that it is evaluating options to reduce its costs as it navigates these challenges.\n\n The top executive from marketing and corporate communications firm Omnicom (OMC) reaffirmed plans to move forward with the acquisition of advertising giant Interpublic Group (IPG), pushing back against claims that the deal could result in client losses. However, shares of both companies dropped more than 7% on Wednesday.\n\n Semiconductor stocks dropped after chip giants Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) said they expect to take significant charges related to export restrictions imposed by the Trump administration. Nvidia anticipates a $5.5 billion hit in its fiscal first-quarter results. In comparison, AMD foresees a charge of up to $800 million. Reports said that Nvidia's H20, AMD's MI308, and other equivalent chips will need export licenses to be sold to Chinese firms. AMD shares plunged 7.4%, while Nvidia shares lost 6.9%.\n\n Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares declined 5.8% on Wednesday, reversing some of the strong gains notched this week after the data analytics firm struck a deal with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for the deployment of Palantir's artificial intelligence (AI) military system. Shares of other enterprise software providers also lost ground amid broad pressure in the tech sector following Powell's comments about tariffs and their possible inflationary impact.\n\n Crude oil futures prices moved higher after the U.S. government announced sanctions on Chinese importers of oil from Iran, increasing concerns about global supply. The uncertain outlook for the global economy has pressured the commodity's price this month, and the bounce back helped lift oil and gas stocks. Shares of exploration and production company APA Corp. (APA) led the way, with a gain of 3.2%, marking Wednesday's top performance in the S&P 500. \n\n Abbott Laboratories (ABT) shares jumped 2.8% after the maker of medical devices and other health care products reported better-than-expected first-quarter sales and profits. The company also reaffirmed its full-year earnings per share (EPS) guidance. It announced plans to invest $500 million in two manufacturing and research and development (R&D) facilities in Texas and Illinois that are set to open this year.\n\n Gold prices surged to another record high as the precious metal's safe-haven appeal remains solid in the tense geopolitical environment.

The export restrictions on Nvidia come as President Donald Trump’s tariffs are roiling global markets and raising concerns about the prospects for global economic growth.\n    \n\n            The World Trade Organization on Wednesday said its expectations for global trade this year have “deteriorated sharply” owing to the battery of new tariffs on goods and uncertainty around future trade policy.\n    \n\n            The H20 chip, released just last year, was purposefully made to accommodate stringent US export controls to China and allowed Nvidia to continue selling to the country. The model has less computing power than the more powerful H100 AI chip, which has already been banned for sale to China.\n    \n\n            “Nvidia specifically designed the H20 to comply with US exports restrictions…now the rules change and they lost $5 billion,” said Jay Hatfield, chief executive at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. “So this inconsistent trade policy is costing companies a lot of money.”\n    \n\n            The H20 is believed to have contributed to DeepSeek’s successful development of its ChatGPT-like reasoning AI model, R1, which was said to be trained at a fraction of the cost of American equivalents. The development stunned the tech industry and sparked an AI revolution in China.\n    \n\n            Nvidia said in a Tuesday regulatory filing that it was informed by the US government last week the H20 chips would now require a special license to be exported to China, which accounted for 13% of sales last year.\n    \n\n            The chipmaker said it will report approximately $5.5 billion worth of charges in its first quarter’s earnings on May 28, associated with H20 products for “inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.”\n    \n\n            Analysts led by Dan Ives, global head of technology research at financial services firm Wedbush Securities, said the financial impact is small relatively, but the restrictions mark a “strategic blow” for Nvidia’s efforts to continue engaging its Chinese customers.\n    \n\n            “This disclosure is a clear sign that Nvidia now has massive restrictions and hurdles in selling to China as the Trump Administration knows there is one chip and company fueling the AI Revolution and it’s Nvidia,” they said in a Tuesday research note.\n    \n\n            The industry-leading AI chip designer has been caught in the crossfire in recent years as the US seeks to block China’s use of American technology to advance its military and AI systems.\n    \n\n            The US Commerce Department confirmed on Tuesday it was issuing new export licensing requirements on China-related exports of Nvidia’s H20 and another American AI chipmaker AMD’s MI308 chips, as well as their equivalents, according to Reuters.\n    \n\n            “The Commerce Department is committed to acting on the President’s directive to safeguard our national and economic security,” a Commerce Department spokesperson was quoted as saying.\n    \n\n            Nvidia was told the license requirement would be in place indefinitely, the company said in the filing. It is unclear how the US government would grant the licenses. The company declined to comment beyond its filing.\n    \n\n            While the Trump administration’s imposition of curbs on the H20 chips was widely expected, the restriction was more abrupt than anticipated, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a Wednesday note.\n    \n\n             Since DeepSeek’s R1 model shook global markets earlier this year, American lawmakers on both sides of the aisle jointly called for tighter export controls on AI chips.\n    \n\n            In the months since, China has seen an AI boom, with DeepSeek’s reveal galvanizing investment and pressure on Chinese companies to advance its AI sector. Investor confidence in the country’s tech sector has surged, driving rallies in China and Hong Kong stocks.\n    \n\n            DeepSeek, along with many of China’s established tech giants, have been major consumers of Nvidia’s H20 graphic processing units. While Chinese tech heavy weight Huawei and AI chipmaker Cambroon have developed alternatives to H20s, those China-made chips generally lag in performance, particularly in software maturity, according to Brady Wang, associate director of Counterpoint Research, a market analysis firm.\n    \n\n            The performance gap between Chinese chips and Nvidia’s is expected to widen, Wang said, because of “Nvidia’s superior ecosystem and manufacturing advantages,” even as  DeepSeek’s rise demonstrates that high-performing AI models can be trained with lower-spec hardware.\n    \n\n            The prospects for the global economy have taken a knock because of Trump’s trade war, according to a new report by the WTO.\n    \n\n            The WTO projects global economies will grow more slowly than they would without tariffs — especially in North America, a region dominated by the United States, which will see a greater slowdown than other areas.\n    \n\n            The WTO said it expects global gross domestic product to expand by 2.2% this year. That growth would be 0.6 percentage points lower than the rate it would expect in a scenario with no additional tariffs.\n    \n\n            In North America, the impact will be more severe still, with GDP growth expected to be 1.6 percentage points below what it would be otherwise.\n    \n\n            With the escalation of an aggressive trade war between the US and China, Ives said further restrictions may be coming.\n    \n\n            “While the Nvidia news is concerning, it’s not a shock as we are in the middle of a trade war between the US and China and expect more punches thrown by both sides,” he said.\n    \n\n            In 2022, President Joe Biden began curbing the sale of advanced semiconductors from chipmakers like Nvidia to China over concerns that they could power its military. The controls have subsequently expanded to include restrictions on sales of chipmaking equipment, high-bandwidth memory chips and products manufactured outside the US using American technology in order to limit China’s technological progress.\n    \n\nRelated article\nBiden unveils last round of AI chip curbs aimed at China, Russia\n\n\n            Before Biden stepped down, his administration also broadened the geographic scope of those restrictions, unveiling a global export framework that subjects countries to different restrictions in a bid to prevent advanced AI technology from getting into the hands of adversaries like China through third countries. The new rules are expected to take effect next month.\n    \n\n            The series of restrictions have come under repeated criticism from US tech giants, particularly Nvidia, which says they will undercut US competitiveness.\n    \n\n            Ned Finkle, Nvidia’s vice president of government affairs, wrote in a company blog post that the adoption of AI around the world fuels growth and opportunity for industries at home and abroad. But the restrictions put that global progress “in jeopardy” and threatened to “derail innovation and economic growth worldwide,” he said.\n    \nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Nvidia's AI chips have been a key focus of U.S. export controls as U.S. officials have moved to keep the most advanced chips from being sold to China as the U.S. tries to keep ahead in the AI race.

World stocks fell into a downward spiral on Wednesday led by tech losses after Washington said it is putting new curbs on AI chip exports to China, marking an escalation in the global trade war.\nThe Trump administration's latest broadside sparked huge demand for safe-haven assets like gold, the Swiss franc and U.S. Treasuries, even though Fed Chair Jerome Powell signalled he is in no rush to cut interest rates.\nIf U.S. Big Tech had acquired a safe-haven status in the eyes of some investors in recent years, it is disappearing fast. More on that and more below, but first, a round-up of the day's main market moves. I'd love to hear from you, so please reach out to me with comments at . You can also follow me at @ReutersJamie and @reutersjamie.bsky.social.\nIf you have more time to read today, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets.\n1.

Will the damage done to Nvidia and others on Wednesday prompt a similar rethink?\nEconomic signals from China and the U.S. on Wednesday were surprisingly positive, with U.S. retail sales in March and first quarter Chinese GDP growth beating forecasts. But these are rear-view mirror indicators, and if anyone needed it, Wednesday's news is a reminder that the outlook is pretty bleak.\nEconomists at Morgan Stanley and UBS this week cut their Chinese 2025 GDP outlooks to 4.2% and 3.4%, respectively. Anything close to the UBS forecast would be particularly alarming for Beijing, which is targeting growth of around 5%.\nMorgan Stanley's economists estimate tariffs will knock 90 basis points off growth relative to their original forecast, which will only be partially offset by 60 bps of additional stimulus.\nAlthough U.S. growth is slowing, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled on Wednesday the central bank will wait for \"greater clarity\" before deciding its next move on rates. He also said markets have been orderly and downplayed the risk of Fed intervention.\nMassive selling of long-dated Treasuries last week raised fears that part of the bond market wasn't functioning smoothly. There was no sign of that on Wednesday, however, as bonds' 'safe haven' qualities pushed yields down as much as 5 basis points at the short end.\nIn Europe, eyes will turn to Frankfurt where the European Central Bank on Thursday will announce its latest policy decision and ECB President Christine Lagarde will offer her outlook. Market pricing suggests a 25 basis point cut is all but certain, with at least another two coming later this year.\nAnd after Wednesday's rout, the focus in Asia on Thursday will stay on tech as Taiwan's TSMC reports first-quarter earnings. The world's largest contract chipmaker is expected to report a 34.2% increase in revenue to $25.318 billion from $18.87 billion a year ago, according to the mean estimate from five analysts based on LSEG data.\nTech and tariffs - a potent mix which roiled markets on Wednesday and will likely do so again sooner rather than later.\nUS Big Tech swaps 'safe haven' sheen for trade war target\nTreasuries are not the only 'safe haven' U.S. asset getting the cold shoulder as investors around the world rethink their enthusiasm for all things America. The shadow over 'Big Tech' is darkening and lengthening too.\nIn recent weeks, the global trade war, the Trump administration's 'America First' agenda and its apparent disdain for the post-war world order have dramatically slowed inflows into U.S. markets, and in some cases, reversed them. What used to be considered some of the safest shelters from crisis are now looking a little flimsy.\nIt might seem a stretch to put shares of U.S. technology and chip companies, such as Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon, on par with IOUs of the federal government, but these cash-generating emblems of 'U.S. exceptionalism' certainly seemed like sure things up until recently.\nAs these firms' global dominance spread over the past decade and their market footprint reached an unprecedented size, they effectively become ATMs for shareholders, generating record profits running into the hundreds of billions of dollars.\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, the 'Magnificent Seven' - Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Tesla - accounted for a record 35% of the S&P 500's market cap, with a combined valuation of around $17.5 trillion. Credit ratings on some, like Apple, are the same as the U.S. sovereign rating, and yields have even traded below Treasury yields on occasion.\nInvestors of all stripes wanted in, from domestic to foreign, retail to official.\nAnd who could blame them? The 'Mag 7' appeared to offer the best of both investment worlds: a high income-generating asset and a safe-haven. So much so that the Swiss National Bank has a quarter of its $150 billion equity holdings in Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon, and half of the $1.8 trillion Norwegian wealth fund's record $222 billion profit last year came from U.S. tech.\nREALITY CHECK\nBut that sweet spot is gone. The 'American exceptionalism' narrative has been undermined, as the U.S. economy looks set to slow and America's AI invincibility has been shattered by China's DeepSeek. And now tech companies find themselves on the front line of the global trade war.\nWashington is issuing new export licensing requirements for Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China. Nvidia said it faces $5.5 billion in charges, and its shares tumbled 9% on Wednesday, wiping nearly $250 billion off its market value and dragging the broader semiconductor index down 4%.\nTo be sure, U.S. tech has been getting slammed since mid-February, as investors have begun to re-evaluate the sunny outlook they had for the industry under a Trump presidency. The semiconductor index is now deep in a bear market. It has lost 30% in just two months and valuations have come down much more than the wider S&P 500.\nU.S. Big Tech is suddenly vulnerable on multiple fronts. Tariffs and trade restrictions from Washington will bite, as will retaliatory moves from China. And if Europe really wants to hit America where it hurts, tech is an obvious target.\nWHAT GOES UP...\nBut it's also worth remembering how much Big Tech outperformed on the way up. They were - and remain - incredibly profitable. According to LSEG figures, the Mag 7's net profit margin hit a record 25.8% in the fourth quarter, nearly double the S&P 500's 13.4%.\nNvidia's value rose 10-fold in two years to more than $3.5 trillion, Mag 7 stocks more than doubled between October 2023 and last December, and these companies accounted for almost all of the market's profit growth in 2023.\nWhile that halved last year and is expected to decline further this year to around a third, there is still a lot of air left to come out of the balloon.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025.\nOn April 4, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives appeared on CNBC to discuss the potential impact of current tariffs and compared the situation to an economic armageddon. If the current tariffs remain in place, Ives thinks it would lead to a 15% to 20% demand reduction across the board. He thinks that investor anxiety is much higher considering how things were in the March 2020 COVID-19 crash earlier. The analyst thinks that investors should now focus on the likelihood of tariff adjustments from comments about negotiations, the impact on consumer-focused companies, and the potential for demand destruction. He even thinks that companies may refuse to provide guidance in the first-quarter earnings calls due to the persistent tariff uncertainty.\nIves thinks that a lot of tech companies will not be able to absorb high tariff increases and rather this cost will be passed on to the consumers which will lead to significant margin erosion and even potential sales declines. He indicated that tech stocks are currently pricing in a 10% to 15% cut to numbers. He suggests that investors should now look at companies with strong long-term potential as he believes earnings may normalize in 2025 and 2026. The analyst also addressed the defensive performance of defense contractors. While acknowledging the relative stability here, Ives cautioned that even these even such sectors are not immune to tariffs. He noted the significant foreign component, specifically 40% to 50% in some instances, in hardware and other sectors.\nWe sifted through the financial media reports to compile a list of the top NASDAQ stocks to buy for 2025. We then selected the 13 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 223\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a computing infrastructure company. The company’s Compute & Networking segment primarily includes Data Center computing platforms and end-to-end networking platforms. The main offerings in its Graphics segment encompass the GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service, and related infrastructures.\nThe company’s Data Center segment is foundational to its growth and grew by 93% year-over-year in FQ4 2025, while it doubled year-over-year for the full fiscal year 2025. This growth was driven by the rapidly increasing demand for AI infrastructure. 50% of the company’s total revenue comes from major cloud providers. However, these providers are currently looking for more cost-effective alternatives and trying to reduce their reliance on NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) after seeing developments like that of DeepSeek. For this reason, the company’s FQ1 2026 revenue growth guidance is also 9.4% sequentially, which is lower than the previous 12% figure.\nAt the same time, new US AI Diffusion Rules have also been introduced. These rules aim to control the global distribution of advanced AI chips and other technologies so that the spread of powerful AI can be regulated.  However, Bank of America still reaffirmed its Buy rating on the company with a $200 price target of March 28. This is because Large CSPs like Azure, GCP, AWS, and OCI are using the company’s Blackwell systems to meet their growing infrastructure demands.\nGuinness Global Innovators is highly bullish on NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) due to its dominant AI chip market position. It stated the following in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n“For a second year running, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the Fund’s top performing stock, delivering a stellar return of +177.7% over the year. Since the beginning of last year, Nvidia’s ‘Hopper’ GPUs have been at the centre of exploding demand for chips powerful and efficient enough to facilitate the energy intensive requirements of AI processes within datacentres. Initially possessing over 95% of market share in these types of chips, Nvidia have been quick to entrench their position as the technological leader in the space, launching the successor to the current ‘Hopper’ GPU in March, Blackwell, inhibiting the likes of AMD and Intel making meaningful inroads in taking share of the fast-growing market. Compared to the previous iteration (Hopper) which is continuing to fuel Nvidia’s extreme revenue growth, the Blackwell chip is twice as powerful for training AI models and has 5 times the capability when it comes to “inference” (the speed at which AI models respond to queries). Throughout the year, Nvidia’s financial performance has remained resilient. Quarterly revenues hit $35.1 billion in their most recent quarter, beating consensus expectations by 6% and representing a +94% year-over-year increase. Additionally, Nvidia’s data centre segment, driven by the Hopper (H100) chip, grew fivefold over the past year, underscoring the sustained demand for advanced AI infrastructure. The H100 chip, priced at around $40,000, continues to see significant adoption due to its ability to enhance AI model training efficiency while lowering overall costs. This growth is expected to continue as companies invest in upgrading existing data centres and building new ones, with Nvidia well-positioned to capture a significant share of the estimated $2 trillion market opportunity over the next five years. There have been some concerns over Blackwell production delays causing share price volatility however, Nvidia has recovered swiftly, driven by positive earnings results through the year and assurances from management regarding future supply. Additionally, the release of the H200 chip promises to extend Nvidia’s technological leadership, ensuring continued momentum into 2025. While Nvidia’s valuation remains a topic of debate, the stock is not at a significant premium to history, and it still appears reasonable given its dominant market position, innovative prowess, and exposure to long-term secular growth trends in AI, cloud computing, and data infrastructure. As a result, Nvidia remains well-positioned to deliver sustained outperformance over the long term, making it a cornerstone of growth-oriented portfolios.”\nOverall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy so far in 2025. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\nThe stock market took a downward turn on Wednesday after Nvidia said it would take a $5.5 billion charge due to U.S. export restrictions on H20 processors to China and other countries.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC, is the world's largest semiconductor foundry, which fabricates chips for the top consumer electronics companies and chip designers across the globe.  The world's leading companies, such as Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, Sony, and Apple, tap TSMC's plants for manufacturing chips that power personal computers (PCs), smartphones, data centers, and gaming consoles, among others.  As a result, TSMC is in a solid position to benefit from the secular growth of the global semiconductor market, which is expected to hit $2 trillion in annual revenue in 2032.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares fell more than 7% on Wednesday morning, after the company disclosed new export restrictions on its artificial intelligence (AI) chips.  Specifically, the company must now obtain licenses from the U.S. government to sell its H20 processors in China.  Nvidia stock now has plummeted 30% from the record high it reached in January.\nWaste Connections (WCN) possesses the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely earnings beat in its upcoming report.

TSMC's valuation moved lower today in conjunction with news of new export restrictions on Nvidia's processors, higher tariffs on China, and cautious commentary from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is falling fast amid multiple bearish catalysts in Wednesday's trading.  Nvidia's valuation is heading lower today amid multiple bearish catalysts.  Yesterday, the company submitted a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating that it would be taking a $5.5 billion write-down following news from the U.S. government that it would now require an export license to sell its H20 processors to China.\nBuying stocks when overall markets are falling can seem dangerous and counterintuitive.  A great example would have been buying shares of quality companies amid the market chaos of 2020.  While it wasn't an easy time to buy stocks given the uncertainty ahead, doing so could have resulted in some significant gains for investors.\nThe U.S.-China tech war just claimed another high-profile casualty.\nTSMC is a crucial player in the artificial-intelligence chip market, which has been upended by tariff turmoil.\nPresident Trump’s 25% tariffs on the auto sector are the talk of the New York International Auto Show.\nTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results\nSign in to access your portfolio\n\n\n\nTry again."

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nList of 52-Week Lows\nList of 3-Year Lows\nList of 5-Year Lows\nSpot gold climbed 1.7% to $3,283.63 per ounce, while June gold futures peaked at $3,299.52 per ounce. The rally was supported by a weakening U.S. dollar and selling pressure on U.S. Treasuries, reflecting growing concerns about the U.S. economic outlook under President Donald Trump.\nTrump announced a 145% cumulative tariff on Chinese imports earlier this week, with additional levies under consideration for electronics and pharmaceuticals. China responded with a 125% tariff on U.S. goods. While the U.S. president exempted electronics from the latest measures and granted a 90-day reprieve on reciprocal tariffs for select countries, the shifting policy stance left markets unsettled.\nNvidia warned Tuesday that the company faces a $5.5 billion charge in the first quarter due to U.S. restrictions on semiconductor exports to China. The company said the move may limit sales opportunities in one of the world's largest chip markets. Nvidia shares fell 8.79% to $102.34 following the disclosure, leading declines in tech-heavy indices and sparking losses among chipmakers in Asia. The curbs could also restrict access to artificial intelligence components for Chinese firms, increasing the risk of further retaliatory trade actions.\nSilver futures rose 0.5% to $32.455 per ounce, while platinum futures slipped 0.1% to $968.95 per ounce. Copper prices moved lower despite China's first-quarter gross domestic product exceeding expectations.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -3.59%), popularly known as TSMC, is the world's largest semiconductor foundry, which fabricates chips for the top consumer electronics companies and chip designers across the globe. That explains why it has been growing at an impressive pace over the past couple of years.\nThe world's leading companies, such as Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, Sony, and Apple, tap TSMC's plants for manufacturing chips that power personal computers (PCs), smartphones, data centers, and gaming consoles, among others. As a result, TSMC is in a solid position to benefit from the secular growth of the global semiconductor market, which is expected to hit $2 trillion in annual revenue in 2032.\nThat would be more than triple the $656 billion in revenue that the semiconductor industry generated last year. However, TSMC stock has been caught in the tariff turmoil of late, which explains why it is down more than 20% in 2025 as of this writing. But this pullback has made TSMC a terrific bargain.\nLet's look at the reasons why buying TSMC looks like a no-brainer right now.\nTSMC enjoys a massive lead in the foundry market with an estimated share of 67%, according to Counterpoint Research. That figure has been heading higher in recent quarters. Specifically, TSMC's foundry market share increased by six percentage points in 2024. Meanwhile, second-placed Samsung lost ground in this market as its share shrank by three points to 11%.\nA key reason why TSMC has been able to open such a huge gap over rivals in the foundry market is because of its technological advantage. TSMC's advanced process nodes allow its customers to manufacture powerful and power-efficient chips. For example, TSMC's 3-nanometer (nm) node is considered to be the most advanced chip manufacturing technology.\nThis process node is being used to manufacture smartphone chips and PC processors by the likes of AMD, MediaTek, Apple, and Qualcomm. Now, it looks like Nvidia will tap TSMC's 3nm process node to manufacture its next-generation Rubin graphics processing units (GPUs). Looking ahead, TSMC is looking to push the envelope further in chip manufacturing technology with the 2-nanometer process.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nThe company is expected to start mass-producing its 2nm processors in the second half of this year, which could put it ahead of rivals Samsung and Intel. Meanwhile, TSMC is also looking to diversify its global presence. The company has pledged an investment of $165 billion in the U.S. to build advanced chip manufacturing facilities that will power artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\nIt is worth noting that TSMC already fabricates chips for the leading AI semiconductor companies such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Marvell, and its focus on boosting investments in advanced technologies should allow it to maintain its dominant position in the global foundry market. Additionally, TSMC's strategy of diversifying its global manufacturing footprint in countries such as Japan, the U.S., and Europe could turn out to be a smart move in the long run as it could help it mitigate the challenges arising out of potential trade-related conflicts, such as the one we are witnessing right now.\nSo, it won't be surprising to see TSMC remaining the top semiconductor foundry for a long time to come, and that's expected to translate into robust financial growth for the company.\nTSMC finished 2024 with $90 billion in revenue, an improvement of 30% from the prior year. The company has got off to a stronger start in 2025, recording a solid 42% jump in revenue in the first three months of the year to $25.6 billion. That's better than what the market was anticipating. Analysts expect TSMC's growth to gain momentum as the year progresses, as evident from the chart below.\n\nTSM Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\nWhat's more, the chart above also tells us that TSMC is on track to deliver robust growth over the next couple of years as well. Importantly, it won't be surprising to see the company sustaining its solid growth for a much longer period in light of the points discussed in the article. The semiconductor market is set to grow at an impressive pace, and TSMC itself sees a total addressable market worth almost $250 billion in its foundry and packaging services.\nThat figure could be bigger in the future as the size of the semiconductor market keeps growing. Not surprisingly, TSMC management expects to maintain an annual revenue growth rate of 20% for the next five years, which should translate into robust bottom-line growth as well. All this makes TSMC a top semiconductor stock to buy right now as it is trading at just 22 times trailing earnings and 17 times forward earnings, which is a nice discount to the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 27 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks).\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

However, if you're investing in stocks for the long term, the benefits are extremely rewarding. \nA great example would have been buying shares of quality companies amid the market chaos of 2020. Five years ago, around April 14, 2020, the S&P 500 was already down nearly 13.5% for that year despite being in the midst of a rebound after a steep decline in March due to the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic. While it wasn't an easy time to buy stocks given the uncertainty ahead, doing so could have resulted in some significant gains for investors.\nStrategy (MSTR 0.35%), Celsius Holdings (CELH -0.98%), and Nvidia (NVDA -7.03%) have all generated monstrous gains for investors in just the past five years.\nIf you had invested $5,000 into each one of these stocks in April 2020, you'd have well up over $300,000 today. Here's a look at how much those investments would be worth as of April 16, and whether these stocks are still good buys right now.\nThe best-performing stock on this list is Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy. It would have turned a $5,000 investment into roughly $126,750 over just a five-year stretch. It's an astounding performance, especially when you consider that the main reason investors are bullish on it is for its position in Bitcoin -- it prides itself on being the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. \nYet, investing $5,000 into the digital currency itself would have grown to a more modest sum of $63,000. Strategy has been the better investment. Despite posting volatile earnings numbers that sometimes feature massive seven-figure losses, its favorable position on Bitcoin has been a big reason for its rapid rise in value.\nWhile it technically provides companies with business intelligence solutions, Strategy has risen primarily due to the hype and excitement relating to crypto. Its fundamentals don't support its sizable $80 billion-plus market cap. This is a highly speculative and volatile investment, and investors shouldn't assume that because the tech stock has done so well in the past five years, it will be able to replicate these types of returns in the future.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nEnergy drink company Celsius Holdings has made for a tremendous growth stock over the years, establishing itself as one of the top companies in the industry over that time frame. A $5,000 investment in the business five years ago would now be worth a staggering $129,400 -- and this is even with shares of Celsius falling more than 50% over the past 12 months.\nMoving forward, the company can still be an appealing investment given its focus on the sugar-free market, where it can be a big player. It recently announced plans to acquire Alani Nutrition, which will expand its presence in that area. Last year, Celsius' sales grew by just 3% to $1.4 billion, but with much more growth still on the horizon for the business, it may not be too late to invest in the stock.\nChipmaker Nvidia has been a top stock to own due to its growth in artificial intelligence (AI). It plays a vital role in helping businesses expand their AI capabilities. It may seem surprising that the stock isn't higher on this list, but that's largely because of tariffs and the economic uncertainty ahead for the tech industry as a whole, and the risk that spending on chips may slow down in the near future.\nNvidia's five-year returns are still impressive, however, and the stock would have turned a $5,000 investment into close to $73,000 today. The company's dominance in AI chips makes it a strong buy moving forward as Nvidia's robust earnings and growth make it likely the business will become even more valuable in the future, and any dip in price could be an attractive buying opportunity for investors.\nIn its most recent fiscal year, which ended in January, the company reported over $130.5 billion in sales (more than double what it generated a year earlier), and profits of $72.9 billion soared from $29.8 billion in the previous year. Nvidia has been a growth machine, and even if business slows down in the near term, this can still make for an excellent long-term buy.\nIn total, a $15,000 investment across all these stocks five years ago would now be worth a staggering $329,000. These massive returns should remind investors that buying when sentiment is poor may not be as bad a time to invest in the stock market as it may appear to be.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The semiconductor foundry leader's share price closed out the day down 3.6% after having been off as much as 5.6% in the session. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC -2.24%) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -3.07%) fell 2.2% and 3.1% in the session, respectively.\nTSMC's valuation moved lower today in conjunction with news of new export restrictions on Nvidia's processors, higher tariffs on China, and cautious commentary from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The stock is now down 23% year to date. \nNvidia submitted a filing yesterday disclosing a significant new business headwind. The company is now being required to submit for an export license if it wants to sell more of its H20 processors to China, which likely means that the product will be barred from being sold to the country.\nTSMC manufactures the chip designs for the processors, and the foundry specialist could see overall demand pressured by new restrictions preventing advanced artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductors from being sold into the Chinese market.\nTSMC stock also sold off today in response to news that the U.S.'s tariffs on China will be raised to 245% and commentary from Jerome Powell on the potential impacts of the new export taxes. Powell indicated that the Fed would hold off on cutting interest rates until the potential inflationary impacts of new tariffs became more clear. \nAccording to a report published by DigiTimes today, TSMC intends to increase the prices on its 4nm chips by 30% in response to surging demand. The news suggests that the company should continue to post very strong sales growth in the near term, but there are still some big risk factors on the horizon. TSMC looks poised to be the leading manufacturer of advanced chips for AI applications for the foreseeable future, but its significance in the escalating tensions between the U.S. and China means the stock comes with outsized geopolitical risk.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

Months after DeepSeek jolted both Silicon Valley and Wall Street, U.S. officials seem to be weighing several options to limit China’s access to American technologies and consumers.\nOn Tuesday, the White House moved to restrict more of Nvidia’s AI chip sales to China, strengthening rules created by the Biden administration.\nDeepSeek’s popularity among U.S. AI developers has soared in recent months, and the startup’s competitive pricing has forced Silicon Valley to offer frontier AI models at lower costs.\nThere are lingering questions, however, around whether DeepSeek engaged in IP theft to create some of its more competitive models. OpenAI has alleged that the Chinese lab distilled its models, violating OpenAI’s terms of use.\nTopics\nSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\nEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.\nTechCrunch's AI experts cover the latest news in the fast-moving field.\nEvery Monday, gets you up to speed on the latest advances in aerospace.\nStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\n© 2025 Yahoo.\n1,200+ founders & VCs.

Trump has hit China with tariffs of 145% on most goods since taking office, prompting Beijing to retaliate and threatening to wipe out most trade between the world’s biggest economies.\nThe offshore yuan gained 0.2% against the dollar in the wake of the report. The Australian dollar, a China-proxy currency, also advanced 0.5%. S&P 500 Index futures pared losses from as much as 1.6% earlier in the session. The benchmark closed 2.2% lower on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that trade tensions risk undermining the central bank’s employment and inflation goals.\nThe rapid onslaught of US tariffs has engendered broad public support in China for retaliation, giving Xi a political incentive to rebuff Trump’s repeated demands for a phone call. The US leader on Tuesday again called on China to reach out to him in order to kick off negotiations to resolve the trade fight.\nIt’s unclear what will produce a breakthrough to get talks moving. While both sides have indicated they’re open to negotiations, Trump appears determined to get Xi on the phone straight away while China wants any conversation between the leaders to produce a clear outcome.\nEven then if they agree on process, fundamental questions persist on what any agreement would look like. Trump’s demands remain unclear, and tariff levels on China would need to remain high to achieve his goal of balancing trade and attracting manufacturers to the US.\nWhile both China and the US probably want to see tariff rates lowered due to domestic pressure, negotiations are “unlikely to lead to a meaningful deescalation,” said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale SA.\n“There is a bit more clarity on what China is looking from: respect, consistency and a point person,” she said. “So now the ball is in US court on whether they can meet these demands. But that is still difficult — especially if the aim is to contain China’s rise.”\nAccording to the person familiar with Beijing’s thinking, the most important precondition for any talks is that Chinese officials need to know such engagement will be conducted with respect.\nWhile the president has been relatively dovish when speaking publicly about Xi, other members of his administration have been more hawkish, leaving officials in Beijing unsure of the US’s position, the person said.\nWhatever the situation in Trump’s first term, officials in Beijing believe he now has tremendous control over this administration, said the person. As a result, when US officials make pointed statements about China, and Trump doesn’t disavow those views, Chinese officials have assumed the president condones their positions, the person said.\nWhile the person didn’t identify any specific comments by administration officials, Beijing has recently expressed notable displeasure with comments Vice President JD Vance made about “Chinese peasants.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian last week called the remarks “ignorant and disrespectful,” in what was a rare direct rebuke of a senior US leader.\nIn addition to wanting a consistent message from the US administration, officials in Beijing also want to know that Washington is ready to address some of China’s concerns, the person said. Chief among those is the prevailing perception among Chinese officials that the US has enacted policies designed to contain and suppress China’s modernization.\nThe US in recent years has tightened export controls around China in an effort to prevent Beijing from obtaining cutting-edge chips and other advanced technology. Trump’s administration on Monday barred Nvidia Corp. from selling its H20 chip in China, escalating the tech fight with Beijing.\nChina also wants the US to address its national security concerns, particularly over Taiwan, the person said. Beijing claims the self-governing island as part of its territory and has pledged to take steps, including military action if necessary, to protect those claims. China will not undertake any provocative actions on Taiwan, the person said, but it will respond if provoked.\nFinally, Beijing also wants the US to designate a point person to oversee talks, the person said. China has no preference for who that is but they want the person to clearly be speaking and acting with Trump’s authority.\nChinese officials also understand that Trump may want to personally lead the negotiations, the person said. While Beijing would be flattered by Trump wanting to invest his time to such discussions, the person said, China believes the best way forward is for officials designated by the two presidents to oversee the talks.\nThat would be the most effective way to ensure that negotiations culminated in a meaningful summit between Trump and Xi, the person said.\n‘Inching’ Toward Talks\nTrump on Wednesday personally met with visiting Japanese officials in town to negotiate a trade deal, saying “big progress” had been made. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said Japan, a military ally, will likely be prioritized along with other US partners in an effort to harness a collective effort to apply economic pressure on China.\nIn one sign of the confusion around US policy toward China, the Trump administration confirmed Wednesday morning the baseline tariff rate on Chinese imports to the US remains 145%, after a White House fact sheet released Tuesday afternoon Washington time said the nation “now faces up to a 245% tariff on imports to the United States as a result of its retaliatory actions.”\nThe figure takes into account preexisting duties on certain Chinese products, such as electric vehicles that faced a 100% charge before Trump’s second term, according to a White House official. Those older duties were added to the 145% Trump rate.\nChina had noted the cumulative tariff rate on certain exports is 245% and reiterated it will “fight to the end” if the US continues to harm its interests, the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.\nBoth sides appear to be “inching toward the negotiating table,” said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Both sides are trying to convey they are in a stronger position and that the ball is in the others’ court, but they’re now also trying to shape the potential agenda, participants and process for talks.”\n--With assistance from Wenjin Lv, Fran Wang and Derek Wallbank.\n(Updates with analyst comment in final paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nSince his inauguration in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has announced - and sometimes reversed - tariffs on a slew of products and countries.  \"Approximately 70% of our aluminum produced in Canada is destined for U.S. customers and is now subject to 25% tariff costs ...

The online retailers, both of which ship low-priced China-made goods direct to U.S. shoppers, had been on an ad spree until recently, targeting younger, thriftier shoppers in digital media.  U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order earlier this month threatens this business.\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors who may have been hoping the Federal Reserve is poised to come to the aid of tariff-rattled markets took away an unwelcome message from the central bank's chief on Wednesday: the Fed may be in a bind.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank would wait for more data on the economy's direction before changing interest rates.  Speaking to the Economic Club of Chicago, he noted that there was a potentially tough situation developing for the Fed in which inflation is pushed higher by tariffs while growth and potentially, employment, weaken.\nNetflix is slated to report first-quarter results after markets close Thursday, and options markets suggest traders are expecting a stock price big move in the following days.\nChina-founded e-commerce sites Temu and Shein say they plan to raise prices for U.S. customers starting next week, a ripple effect from President Donald Trump's attempts to correct the trade imbalance between the world's two largest economies by imposing a sky-high tariff on goods shipped from China.  Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, which is now based in Singapore, said in separate but nearly identical notices that their operating expenses have gone up “due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs.”  Both companies said they would be making “price adjustments” starting April 25, although neither provided details about the size of the increases.\nTip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results\nSign in to access your portfolio\n\n\n\nTry again."

That decision comes after earlier setbacks tied to severe nausea in its twice-daily versionand leaves Pfizer even further behind in a weight-loss market expected to hit $130 billion by 2030. With demand for Covid products fading fast, the company had pinned big hopes on obesity drugs to fill the gap. Instead, it's now heading back to the drawing board.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with PFE.\nThe market didn't take the news lightly. Pfizer shares dropped around 1% premarket 8.59am, while rivals popped. Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) jumped 2.75%, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) rose 2.27% , and Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX) soared nearly 20% in the premarket trading at the same timeall riding momentum from stronger weight-loss offerings. Lilly's Zepbound, a once-weekly injectable, is already generating nearly $5 billion a year and has an oral version in the final stretch of trials. Structure Therapeutics and AstraZeneca aren't far behind, with their own oral contenders in the pipeline.\nThis misstep throws more heat on Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who's under pressure to offset looming patent cliffs that could wipe out $15 billion in revenue by decade's end. So far, the pipeline hasn't delivered, and the M&A spree hasn't produced a clear winner. As competitors rack up approvals and market share, Pfizer may have to rethink its next moveand fast.

In one of these studies, an asymptomatic patient experienced a potential drug-induced liver injury. The injury resolved after drug discontinuation; however, Pfizer has decided, based on this event, available clinical data, and recent input from regulators to discontinue the development of the drug. The therapy has been investigated in a total of 1,400 patients.\nChief scientific officer and president of R&D at Pfizer, Dr. Chris Boshoff said: “While we are disappointed to discontinue the development of danuglipron, we remain committed to evaluating and advancing promising programs in an effort to bring innovative new medicines to patients.”\nPfizer will be presenting data from the studies at an upcoming medical conference and peer-reviewed journal.\nUnlike some of its big pharma competitors, Pfizer has not had much luck in the obesity pill space. In December 2023, the company stopped the development of the twice-daily version of danuglipron due to high rates of gastrointestinal side effects. This came six months after the company had culled another oral GLP-1-RA candidate, lotiglipron, due to associated high transaminase levels.\nThe company still has another oral obesity candidate in trials, a once daily glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor antagonist, PF-07976016. The therapy is being investigated in a Phase IIa trial (NCT06717425), which was initiated in December 2024.\nPfizer faces fierce competition in the obesity space, especially from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, both of which have cemented a reputation with their subcutaneous GLP-1RA therapies Wegovy (semaglutide) and Zepbound (tirzepatide), respectively.\nEli Lilly is also looking to enter the oral obesity space and is running a Phase III programme of its daily pill orforglipron. GlobalData predicts sales of orforglipron to reach $11.8bn in 2030.\nGlobalData is the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.\nBiotechs are also making headway in the obesity arena. Viking Therapeutics is studying an oral version of the weight loss therapy VK2735 in an ongoing Phase II study (NCT06828055), and its subcutaneous formulation is set to enter a Phase III trial in Q2 2025.\nPfizer’s stock, listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), remains stable despite the danuglipron announcement. Meanwhile, Viking’s stock, listed on the Nasdaq exchange, jumped by 21% at market open today (14 April).\n\n\n                The gold standard of business intelligence.\n            \n\n\n                    Find out more\n                    \n\n\n\n\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit our Privacy Policy for more information about our services, how we may use, process and share your personal data, including information on your rights in respect of your personal data and how you can unsubscribe from future marketing communications.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar.\nOn Thursday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer cautioned viewers about what may lie ahead once the 90-day pause on new tariffs comes to an end. While discussing the latest Consumer Price Index report, Cramer acknowledged that the numbers looked favorable, with inflation appearing relatively tame and even some categories experiencing actual price declines. He pointed to energy prices, saying, “The best, anything it touched energy, which is plummeting.”\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks and 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently.\n“This is essentially an embargo. President Trump’s ecstatic that the tariffs are already taking in $2 billion a day. He’s thrilled that supposedly 75 countries are begging for something more reasonable than the 90-day pause when the 90-day pause comes to an end.”\nAccording to Cramer, President Trump is “ecstatic” that these tariffs are already generating $2 billion a day in revenue and is thrilled about 75 countries “supposedly” asking for something more workable once the 90-day grace period concludes. Despite the seemingly positive revenue flow, Cramer expressed concern over the broader consequences. He pointed out that many Americans have yet to grasp the full impact of trade policies that have allowed foreign businesses to flood U.S. markets with inexpensive products, often pricing out domestic companies.\nWhile many consumers embraced the lower costs, Cramer reminded his audience that it came at the expense of American jobs. “Now we’re going to have to pay a price. He stressed that consumers should be prepared to pay significantly more for a wide range of goods. He said that the additional cost largely will likely benefit foreign companies, which will hike prices in response to the tariffs imposed on them. He clarified his position by stating he is not a staunch advocate of free trade for its own sake. “No other country plays by the rules on trade, so we shouldn’t either,” he said but cautioned:\n“We just have to be more thoughtful about this or we’ll end up doing more harm than good. Again, as someone who wants fair trade, not free trade, I am rooting for the president to pull this off, but not at the expense of great American companies that have done nothing wrong and are the best in the world.”\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA medical technician wearing protective gloves and a mask mixing a biopharmaceutical solution.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 92\nA caller asked if Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was a buy or not and Cramer remarked:\n“Well, let me tell you something… right now, we have a government that is trying to figure out whether it’s going to tax the heck out of drug companies, raise tariffs outta drug companies or not. I can’t make a prediction anymore. It yields 8%. Normally I say fine, but you know what? Let’s say you decide, you know what, we need big tariffs on Pfizer. You’ll say, wow, I’m buying that stock at 18 rather than 21. So I’m going to have to say, pass.”\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) focuses on discovering, creating, manufacturing, and supplying biopharmaceutical products. Its work covers areas such as heart health, infectious illness, cancer treatment, immune system conditions, and vaccines. On March 31, Cramer said:\n“Is Pfizer dead money? I mean I think it’s been mummified. I don’t know. I mean it’s like, wow. Look at that thing. Close the casket… Alright, Pfizer is unfortunately dead money. Dr. Bourla’s a terrific guy… what can I say? He’s a terrific guy. He’s a terrific guy.”\nOverall, PFE ranks 1st on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar. While we acknowledge the potential of PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PFE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

This move was primarily due to safety concerns in clinical studies. Despite achieving key pharmacokinetic goals, the discovery of a potential drug-induced liver injury prompted Pfizer to reassess its strategy. This decision adds weight to the company's stock performance, contrasting with broader market trends, where major indexes experienced upward movement amidst tariff-related developments and positive gains in tech sectors. Pfizer's decision highlights the importance of rigorous safety evaluations in pharmaceutical developments.\nWe've discovered 3 warning signs for Pfizer (2 are significant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\nExplore 22 top quantum computing companies leading the revolution in next-gen technology and shaping the future with breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, superconducting qubits, and cutting-edge research.\nThe cessation of Danuglipron’s development could significantly influence Pfizer's revenue and earnings forecasts moving forward. By prioritizing rigorous safety measures, Pfizer may face setbacks in accelerating R&D productivity and the associated revenue streams. This shift may lead to a more conservative approach in pipeline-driven growth expectations and could delay anticipated financial impacts from new products, potentially further pressuring revenue forecasts already impacted by legislative changes. The development halt aligns with observed market volatility around Pfizer shares, shedding light on investor concerns regarding the company's future earning capabilities amidst evolving challenges in the pharmaceutical sector.\nOver the past year, Pfizer's total return, including dividends, was a 10.14% decline, signaling underperformance relative to both the broader market and the US Pharmaceuticals industry, which experienced negative returns of 8.6%. During this period, the company's earnings showed considerable growth from a very low base, yet they have not matched market expectations overall. Notably, analysts have set a fair value price target of US$26.02, suggesting upside potential compared to the current share price of US$22.49. However, this assumes improvements in profit margins and financial performance that are not without risk given current operational challenges and headwinds from pricing reforms in Medicare.\nUnderstand Pfizer's track record by examining our performance history report.\n This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Bank of America Corporation (BAC), Chevron Corporation (CVX) and Stryker Corporation (SYK), as well as two micro-cap stocks Value Line, Inc. (VALU) and Sypris Solutions, Inc. (SYPR). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Today's Featured Research ReportsShares of Bank of America have gained +2.5% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry’s gain of +20.4%. The company’s volatile nature of the trading business is a major headwind. Despite an impressive performance since 2022, it is expected to normalize going forward. This is likely to hamper fee income growth. The Zacks analyst project non-interest income to rise only 3.4% in 2025. Continued investments in the franchise will keep the company’s expenses elevated. We expect total non-interest expenses to rise 3% this year. While high funding costs are still a woe, the company’s net interest income (NII) will be positively impacted by higher rates for longer. The Zacks analyst expects NII to record a CAGR of 5.3% over the next three years. Plans to open financial centers in new and existing markets and improve digital capabilities will aid the top line. We project total revenues to grow 4.8% in 2025.(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here >>>)Chevron’s shares have declined -6.2% over the past six months against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry’s decline of -11.9%. The company being a fully integrated energy firm, is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin. Further, the planned acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana. However, the company is grappling with high sensitivity to oil fluctuations and relatively expensive valuation. Another concern is the weak margins on refined products that forced its downstream segment to its first quarterly loss in 4 years. Considering these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>>)Shares of Stryker have gained +4.3% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Products industry’s gain of +5.5%. The company is poised for growth, driven by rising demand for robotic-assisted procedures, hospital capital expenditures and international expansion. The Mako SmartRobotics platform fuels adoption, while acquisitions like Inari Medical and Vertos Medical enhance the portfolio. Stryker is actively integrating new technologies such as AI-driven imaging and smart surgical systems to improve patient outcomes and maintain its competitive edge. Pricing improvements and a strong hospital order book support 2025 growth. However, foreign exchange volatility and acquisition-related margin pressures may impact earnings. Supply chain disruptions and rising costs could strain profitability. Intensifying competition in robotics and MedTech demands constant innovation. Macroeconomic risks, including potential downturns in healthcare spending and regulatory shifts, add uncertainty.(You can read the full research report on Stryker here >>>)Value Line’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry over the past year (+10% vs. +6.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $370.23 million have robust cash generation, with cash balances rising to $27.1 million from $6.1 million YoY, enhances liquidity and supports dividends, buybacks, and growth investments. EAM Trust income surged 47.7% to $13.8 million, driven by AUM growth to $5 billion, providing a rising, diversified passive income stream. The company maintains disciplined capital returns, paying $0.90/share in dividends and repurchasing shares, with $0.9 million authorization remaining. Portfolio gains doubled to $3.6 million, bolstering earnings. Strong branding and diversified offerings serve both retail and institutional clients, supporting market position. However, core publishing revenue declined to $26.7 million, and customer concentration (30% from one client) heightens risk. Operating costs and taxes rose, further pressuring margins, while limited international presence (~2% of revenues) increases vulnerability to U.S. market shifts.(You can read the full research report on Value Line here >>>)Shares of Sypris Solutions have gained +3.6% over the past year against the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry’s gain of +36.3%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $36.37 million benefits from an extended long-term supply agreement with a global OEM, securing stable revenues as a sole-source supplier of Ultra Axle Shafts. Sypris Solutions’ diversified presence across automotive, energy, and industrial markets reduces risk and positions it to capitalize on growth trends in heavy-duty vehicles and energy infrastructure. Sypris Solutions is also aligned with growth in aerospace and defense electronics, leveraging its capabilities in high-precision components to meet rising demand. Expansion into the Asia-Pacific region aligns with high-growth markets, leveraging regional investments in defense and infrastructure. However, liquidity challenges constrain financial flexibility. Rising costs and reliance on cyclical markets such as heavy vehicles and oil and gas exacerbate margin sensitivity. Competitive pressures in aerospace further heighten vulnerability.(You can read the full research report on Sypris Solutions here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Pfizer Inc.

Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Anjalee Khemlani joins Market Domination Overtime to break down the details, as well as preview what to watch as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) prepares to report earnings.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here.\nPfizer announcing today that it is halting a late stage trial of its GLP-1 pill candidate. And Yahoo! Finance's very own Angelina Kamlani joins us now with the latest, Ange.\nJosh, that's right. We heard from Pfizer today that it is choosing to halt its phase three trial of danuglipron, that is its once daily oral pill that was supposed to be a really good competitor in the market. They said that they stopped it because one of the clinical trial participants had a liver injury and after getting off the pill was able to recover. So that is where things stand. This is, you know, really a bumpy ride for Pfizer and the end to it essentially for this one molecule. We'll have to see what the company decides to do. If you take a look at the stock, though, it didn't really move much on the news today, Wall Street seemed to kind of shrug it off, and it seems that analysts are looking at maybe the company looking inwardly through its pipeline or externally to acquire something to get it into the obesity space. Uh we got Akash Tewari from Jefferies saying that we're removing danuglipron from our model and lowering the price target for Pfizer as a result from $34 to $32, and we view this as another frustrating hit to management's credibility. The company has really been under the watch of investors for some time, and you can see on your screen the struggle that it had to really enter this obesity space already, ending one candidate earlier on in June 23rd because of similar liver issues, and then looking at twice daily danuglipron having to scrap that, then advancing once daily and now scrapping that as well. That leaves Eli Lilly as the only contender in the marketplace, uh, for a pill, as well as, of course, already a market leader with the injectables. So, really hot obesity space that Pfizer is missing out on, and investors are looking at what it can do to really get the next blockbuster out of its pipeline. I guess we'll have to wait till earnings at the end of the month to hear more about that.\nAnge, healthcare is such a big business, but if you get it right, you make a lot of money. Johnson & Johnson reports earnings tomorrow. Any wisdom, what to expect?\nYeah, we're definitely keeping an eye on a few things for Johnson & Johnson. Of course, it is a maker of medical devices, which we know have been hit by the tariffs as well as a pharmaceutical manufacturing, which has been, uh, looked at as having some sort of special tariffs that we've heard from President Trump. So, we're looking on any kind of impact from those conversations, as well as broader tariff impact on guidance. We've seen a couple of companies pull, and we'll see if Johnson & Johnson does so as well. We do know the company has committed to $55 billion in US manufacturing. So we'll have to see how that all shakes out when the company, uh, lets us know tomorrow morning.\nAnge, thank you. Appreciate it.\nJohnson & Johnson is holding its earnings outlook steady despite President Donald Trump signaling he could put tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry. The administration announced earlier it would conduct an investigation into drug imports. That move is widely seen as a first step toward imposing new levies. Earnings and revenue both beat estimates for the quarter.

Under the law, the Commerce Secretary is expected to deliver the results of his investigation within 270 days, though Trump and other officials have signaled these efforts could conclude more quickly.\nThe US president has long decried foreign production of drugs and chips as a threat to national security and threatened to slap tariffs on imports in a bid to revive American manufacturing of those products. But the duties could also wreak havoc on supply chains and drive up costs for Americans.\nNew levies threaten to roil a chips industry that notched more than $600 billion in global sales of semiconductors essential to products ranging from cars to airplanes and mobile phones to consumer electronics. Supply chains still feeling the effect of disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic now could face new strains from the US duties.\nThe administration’s announcement came days after it exempted semiconductors, mobile phones, computers and other electronics imports from 145% duties applied to China. That announcement was seen as a boon to tech giants like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., but Trump and his advisers quickly said the relief would be short lived and that separate levies would be placed on chips.\nThe Commerce Department investigation on semiconductors is designed to have a wide range, evaluating imports of both legacy and leading-edge chips that are coveted for artificial intelligence applications. The probe will span imports of all semiconductors and the equipment used to manufacture them as well as electronic products that contain the components, according to the government notice.\nTariffs on the semiconductor sector risk affecting a wide range of companies that send billions of dollars in microprocessors and related goods to the US each year. Foreign makers of advanced chips including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and SK Hynix of South Korea could be forced to raise prices or accept smaller margins if Trump delivers on his threat of import levies.\nThe measures also threaten to impose higher costs on Trump’s vision for expanding domestic semiconductor production, especially if imported chip-manufacturing equipment from companies like ASML Holding NV gets hit with tariffs. Netherlands-based ASML is a leading provider of advanced lithography machines used to produce the smallest computer chips used in AI and other sensitive applications.\nThe separate drug probe will examine imports of all pharmaceuticals — both finished generic and non-generic medicines — as well as the ingredients used to make them. Investigators also will probe imports of critical pharmaceutical inputs. The public is invited to weigh in on both probes with comments over the next 21 days.\nTariffs would also be a blow to the world’s largest drugmakers, including Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly & Co., virtually all of which operate scores of manufacturing sites scattered across the globe.\nAlex Schriver, spokesman for the trade group PhRMA, said in a statement that the pharmaceutical industry shares Trump’s goal of boosting US manufacturing. While he said the industry would work with the administration throughout its process, he added that “medicines have historically been excluded from tariffs because they can lead to higher costs and shortages of life-saving medicines.”\nDrug companies have raced to announce major investments in the US ahead of potential tariffs. Most recently, Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG said it plans to invest $23 billion in the US over the next five years, following earlier pledges from Eli Lilly, Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson.\nBut experts warned that likely wouldn’t blunt the impact of the tariffs.\n“There is no quick fix for exposed companies, in our view,” Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a note to clients ahead of the announcement. “Redomiciling manufacturing would take years and be very costly.”\nDrugmakers will face a choice between eating the costs of potential tariffs or raising prices for their medicines in what is already the most expensive market in the world.\n“There’s a lot at stake politically I think for branded manufacturers to be increasing prices here,” said Marta Wosińska, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center on Health Policy. “I do think there’s going to be reluctance to passing through price increases.”\nBecause there are some controls on the price of drugs, tariffs could end up hurting drugmakers’ bottom line, leading them to scale back research, according to Lilly Chief Executive Officer Dave Ricks.\n“We have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade offs within our own companies,” Ricks recently told the BBC. “Typically that will be in reduction of staff or research and development (R&D) and I predict R&D will come first. That’s a disappointing outcome.”\nTrump, who has repeatedly bemoaned US drugmakers’ reliance on overseas production, is breaking decades of tradition. The pharmaceutical industry has long side-stepped trade wars, protected by international agreements that largely protected medicines from tariffs on humanitarian grounds.\nWorldwide Impact\nTrump’s move on semiconductors is similar to the way he’s targeted other sectors, with imported steel, aluminum and automobiles already facing 25% tariffs and an ongoing Commerce Department trade probe expected to result in levies on foreign copper.\nUnder former President Joe Biden, the US already had doubled tariffs on so-called legacy semiconductors from China to 50% and last December launched a probe into Chinese concentration in the category that sets the stage for Trump to impose even higher levies. While not as advanced as chips driving artificial intelligence, the older technology is ubiquitous in autos, airplanes, medical devices and telecommunications.\nTrump has cast revitalizing the US chipmaking industry and industrial base as essential for the nation’s security. Winning a global race to dominate the AI industry is also a top Trump administration priority. Analysts have warned that bringing chip manufacturing to the US will take years of hard work.\nThe move on medicines will have an outsize effect on Ireland, with a $54 billion (€47.6 billion) trade surplus with the US that helped spur Trump’s wrath. The imbalance, heavily weighted by the pharmaceutical industry, stems from the country’s favorable tax regime and highly educated workforce. US drug companies, including Lilly and Pfizer Inc., operate nearly two dozen factories in Ireland that ship to the US, according to a TD Cowen analysis.\nThe US biotech industry, which drives much of the innovation in drug development, is also vulnerable to the new tariffs. Nearly 90% of American companies rely on imported components for US-approved products, according to a recent survey by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. As a result, the supply of medicines for US patients and families are particularly vulnerable to proposed tariffs on the European Union, China and Canada, the group wrote.\nNearly all of the companies surveyed said they expect manufacturing costs to surge if import tariffs are placed on the European Union. Half of the 42 companies said they’d be forced to scramble for new research and manufacturing partners or they’d need to rework or potentially delay regulatory filings for new products.\n“Re-onshoring key parts of the biotechnology supply chain to the U.S. and our allies and strengthening the American manufacturing base should be a high priority for both national and economic security,” BIO President John Crowley said in a statement. “It will take years, though, for this shift. We need to be mindful of the negative consequences of these proposed tariffs.”\nTrump’s Exemptions\nThe US president earlier Monday announced he would consider temporary reprieves from his 25% tariff on automotive imports to allow companies time to bring production to the US.\nThe announcement suggested that the president was willing to negotiate with industry leaders, and a similar push from technology and pharmaceutical executives is almost certain to follow.\n“He’s going to get this onshoring to happen as soon as possible and as orderly as possible,” Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Monday on Fox Business. “And so when he talks to CEOs and they say, ‘Hey, I need a little more time with this, I need a little time more more time with that,’ then he’s absolutely willing to listen.”\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, said the administration remained focused on negotiating deals that would benefit Americans.\n“I think we’re going to start the negotiations, and just like with everyone else, I’m telling them, bring your A-game. We’ll see what you got, and we’ll go from there,” Bessent said.\nTrump was asked what short-lived product exclusions he was considering but did not specify how long a potential pause or lowering of auto levies would remain in place.\n--With assistance from Michael Shepard, Annmarie Hordern, Hadriana Lowenkron and Derek Wallbank.\n(Updates with pharmaceutical industry comment in 13th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nCheap Consumer Goods Are the American Dream, Actually\nWorld Travelers Are Rethinking Vacation Plans to the US\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s Fair Trade Commission ordered Alphabet Inc.’s Google to stop alleged abuse of its market power over local smartphone manufacturers, just ahead of high-stakes trade negotiations with the US this week.Most Read from BloombergHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?Even Oslo Has an Air Quality ProblemNYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six$15 Million Fund Bets Leadership Training Can Improve Chicago PolicingLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fi\nNetflix shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives said the streaming giant aims to double its revenue and join the $1 trillion market capitalization club by 2030.\nWe recently published a list of Jim Cramer Sounds the Alarm on China Rhetoric and Dollar Panic Then Analyzes 11 Key Stocks.

At its beaten-down price, the stock offers an eye-popping 7.8% yield.\nIf Pfizer continues its dividend-raising streak, investors who buy at recent prices could realize market-beating gains over the long run. Let's look a little closer at danuglipron, plus some bigger problems the company faces, to see if this stock could be a smart buy on the dip.\nThe end of Pfizer's danuglipron program highlights just how risky the drug-development process can be. According to the company, it discontinued development after just one patient in a dose-optimization study experienced a liver injury that could have been caused by the experimental GLP-1 pill.\nThe danuglipron program's termination is disappointing, but it won't be the end of Pfizer's attempt to develop blockbuster weight-management drugs. The company has an oral glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) antagonist in phase 2 trials. Investors will probably hear more about this candidate, tentatively named PF-07976016, down the road.\nA disappointing outcome for a weight-management candidate isn't anywhere near the top of Pfizer's list of problems. Investors should be far more concerned with an upcoming loss of patent-protected market exclusivity for Eliquis. Sales of the oral blood thinner it markets in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb rose to $7.4 billion, or 11.6% of total revenue last year.\nEliquis is expected to lose patent-protected exclusivity in 2026, although generic competition in the U.S. market isn't expected to begin until 2028. Pfizer's second-largest revenue stream in 2024 could also start drying up soon. The Prevnar family of vaccines was responsible for over 10% of total sales last year. Prevnar 13 is expected to lose patent-protected exclusivity in the U.S. next year.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nVyndaqel has been a strong growth driver for Pfizer but probably not for much longer. This treatment prevents heart damage caused by transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis and grew sales by 64% to reach $5.4 billion last year. Bridge Bio and Alnylam are now marketing competing treatments for the limited population of TTR amyloidosis patients with heart damage. In addition to competing treatments, Vyndaqel is expected to face generic competition in the U.S. in 2028.\nDrug developers need to communicate with regulators at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before, during, and after they run clinical trials for new drug candidates. In the U.S., many of those regulators recently lost their jobs.\nIn 2024, the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approved 50 new drugs. The CDER director, Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., stepped down in January and joined Pfizer's C-suite as chief medical officer.\nHaving the former CDER director on staff could be advantageous for Pfizer, but I'll be pleasantly surprised if the FDA completes new drug approvals at half the usual pace this year. According to reporting from STAT, more than a few FDA employees involved in the new drug approval process were among thousands recently fired from the agency.\nA crippled FDA could be a huge problem for Pfizer and its peers who must constantly launch new drugs to overcome exclusivity losses for established products.\nMany investors expect pharmaceutical industry lobbyists to prevent the Trump administration from rendering CDER incapable of reviewing new drug applications at its usual pace. They could be right, but I won't support an investment thesis that relies on industry lobbyists protecting a regulatory agency.\nIf you asked me a month ago, I would have called this stock a buy. In 2023, it earned FDA approval for nine new drugs and last year it reported over a dozen product approvals from the agency. With plenty of new products coming online, Pfizer had a good chance to overcome upcoming patent cliffs and maintain its dividend-raising streak.\nNow that the CDER has been dramatically downsized, it's probably best to assume the worst. I'll be avoiding this and all drugmaker stocks until we see proof that a much smaller FDA can continue approving new drugs at the usual pace.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Pfizer wasn’t one of them.

Although liver enzyme elevations in the enrolled patients were generally consistent with other approved drugs in the same class, one patient experienced a potential case of drug-induced liver injury, which resolved after stopping treatment with danuglipron.\nAfter reviewing all clinical data and considering regulatory feedback, Pfizer concluded that halting the program was the best course of action. This decision reverted Pfizer’s developmental program for an obesity candidate back to the early clinical stages and has significantly delayed its hopes for marketing an obesity drug that would compete with Lilly’s Zepbound and Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy for market share.\nHowever, PFE shares have not slid despite the setback, which likely reflects positive investor expectations regarding Pfizer’s ability to bounce back from its current predicament. Pfizer plans to continue the development of its oral GIPR antagonist candidate, PF-07976016, which is currently in mid-stage development and other early-stage obesity programs. Pfizer could also in-license rights to a late-stage obesity candidate from other biotechs for developing and commercialization.\nInterestingly, Jefferies reduced Pfizer’s price target from $34 to $32 following the setback, but maintained its BUY rating for the stock.\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly currently dominate the obesity market on the back of the tremendous success of their GLP-1 injections. Lilly markets its dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, tirzepatide, as Zepbound for obesity, while Novo Nordisk markets its semaglutide drug as Wegovy injection for weight management.\nYear to date, shares of PFE, LLY and NVO have lost 16.6%, 2.3% and 23.2%, respectively, compared with the industry’s 4.9% decline.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPfizer’s setback eliminates an imminent contender for LLY and NVO’s market share in the obesity space. Both firms have been raking in substantial revenues from the sale of their respective obesity injections. In 2024, Zepbound sales amounted to $4.9 billion, while Wegovy sales recorded $8.4 billion during the same time frame, both representing a substantial increase over their previous year's figures.\nShares of Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Viking Therapeutics and Structure Therapeutics rose as Pfizer's decision to discontinue its obesity pill program removes a key competitor from the market. Lilly and Novo Nordisk are also developing oral pills for treating obesity. Oral drugs are easier to use compared to injections, which can improve patient compliance. NVO is developing its oral obesity pill, amycretin, in a mid-stage study while Lilly’s oral obesity pill, orforglipron, is currently undergoing phase III development.\nViking Therapeutics and Structure Therapeutics also have oral obesity candidates in their pipeline in mid-stage development.\nYear to date, shares of VKTX and GPCR have plunged 38.9% and 30.1%, respectively, compared with the industry’s 6.4% decline.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nVKTX is currently evaluating the safety and efficacy of the oral formulation of its experimental obesity drug, VK2735, in a mid-stage study. Last month, the company reported completing enrollment in the phase II VENTURE-Oral Dosing study of the candidate for the obesity indication. Data from this study is expected in the second half of 2025.\nVKTX also plans to start a late-stage study on the subcutaneous version of VK2735 by the first half of this year.\nOn the other hand, Structure Therapeutics is conducting multiple mid-stage studies on its lead candidate, aleniglipron(GSBR-1290), a highly selective oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, for treating healthy overweight or obese individuals.\nThe rapid advancements being made by Viking Therapeutics and Structure Therapeutics in the development of their respective oral obesity treatment candidates have made them lucrative targets for collaboration or M&A deals.\nWhile Pfizer, Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and  Structure Therapeutics currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each, Viking Therapeutics has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present.\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Pfizer’s dose-optimization studies of once-daily formulations of danuglipron met key pharmacokinetic objectives and confirmed a formulation and dose with the potential to deliver a competitive efficacy and tolerability profile in Phase 3 testing, based on earlier studies of twice-daily danuglipron. While the overall frequency of liver enzyme elevations across the over 1,400 participant safety database of danuglipron is in-line with approved agents in the class, a single asymptomatic participant in one of the dose-optimization studies experienced potential drug-induced liver injury which resolved after discontinuation of danuglipron. After a review of the totality of information, including all clinical data generated to date for danuglipron and recent input from regulators, Pfizer has decided to discontinue development of the molecule.\n“Cardiovascular and metabolic diseases including obesity remain important areas of unmet medical need, and we plan to continue applying our global capabilities to advance a pipeline of investigational treatments that have the potential to fill critical gaps in patient care, including continued development of our oral GIPR antagonist candidate and other earlier obesity programs,” said Chris Boshoff, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Research and Development at Pfizer. “While we are disappointed to discontinue the development of danuglipron, we remain committed to evaluating and advancing promising programs in an effort to bring innovative new medicines to patients.”\nLIMITED REACTION: Commenting on the news, Morgan Stanley says that its sense is that investor expectations for Danu were low. With Pfizer shares trading at a greater than 7% dividend yield, which could offer support for the stock, the firm expects “a limited reaction” in the shares to the discontinuation news. Morgan Stanley keeps an Equal Weight rating and $31 price target on Pfizer shares. The firm also notes that it expects initial Phase 3 data for Eli Lilly’s Orforglipron this quarter representing the next key catalyst for the oral GLP-1 category.\nMOSTLY POSITIVE: JPMorgan says Pfizer’s decision to discontinue development of danuglipron, an oral small molecule GLP-1, due to a liver toxicity issue in one patient, is “mostly a positive” for Structure Therapeutics and Viking Therapeutics. Structure is now in line to become the second small molecule oral to enter the market and Viking becomes an “even more attractive partnership candidate,” the firm tells investors in a research note. JPMorgan believes Structure shares could be modestly up, to 5%, as a result of Pfizer’s update.\nPRICE ACTION: In Monday morning trading, shares of Pfizer are up modestly at $22.17, while Viking’s shares have jumped about 10% to $24.43 and Structure has rallied almost 11% to $17.77.\nPublished first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

The firm points out that it has argued that this program has received almost too much attention – not because obesity isn’t important, but because this was only phase 1 data. Without danuglipron, Pfizer’s obesity pipeline now consists of a GIP receptor antagonist in phase 2 and a phase 1 oral GLP-1 in T2D with Nxera Pharma. If the company is committed to obesity, a possible next step could be business development, BofA argues. The firm reiterates a Neutral rating for Pfizer as it believes core thesis remains unchanged.\nDiscover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks.\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using  Tipranks' Stock Screener.\nPublished first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

Although the individual was asymptomatic and fully recovered after stopping the treatment, Pfizer stated that its decision was based on a comprehensive review of all clinical data generated to date, along with recent regulatory feedback.\nWhile the two dose-optimization studies had met key pharmacokinetic goals and identified a dose with the potential for competitive efficacy and tolerability, the safety concerns ultimately led Pfizer to stop further development of danuglipron.\nThis is the second time that Pfizer has faced setbacks in connection with the pipeline development of danuglipron. In December 2023, the company announced that it would not move forward with phase III studies on the twice-daily formulation of danuglipron. Though the drug was effective in reducing weight in a phase IIb study, it caused several gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Back then, the company said that the pharmacokinetic study of the once-daily formulation of danuglipron continues, and it will focus on its development.\nThis also marks the second time in two years that Pfizer has given up on an obesity drug. Back in 2023, Pfizer had dropped the development of another GLP-1-RA candidate, lotiglipron, due to elevated levels of a type of liver enzymes seen in a study.\nFollowing these setbacks, Pfizer has decided to focus on developing its other obesity candidates, which are either in early-stage or mid-stage development. One such candidate is PF-07976016, an investigational GIP receptor being evaluated in a mid-stage study for obesity.\nYear to date, shares of Pfizer have lost nearly 17% compared with the industry’s 7% decline.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPost Pfizer’s announcement, shares of Eli Lilly LLY and Novo Nordisk NVO rose 3% and 2%, respectively, on Monday. Both companies dominate the diabetes and obesity market on the back of the tremendous success of their GLP-1 products. Lilly markets its dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, tirzepatide, as Mounjaro for type II diabetes and as Zepbound for obesity. Novo markets its semaglutide drugs as Ozempic pre-filled pen and Rybelsus oral tablet for type II diabetes and as Wegovy injection for weight management.\nThe obesity market has garnered much interest lately. Per a research conducted by Goldman Sachs, the obesity market in the United States is expected to reach $100 billion by 2030. This is also evident from the fact that LLY and NVO have not only optimized their production capacities but are also developing multiple other novel obesity candidates at a rapid pace.\nThe implication of Pfizer’s setback is clear for both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk — the immediate removal of a potential rival from the highly lucrative GLP-1 market. The latest setback puts Pfizer back at least a couple of years from entering the obesity space.\nA company that benefited from Pfizer’s announcement was Viking Therapeutics VKTX, which jumped nearly 11% on Monday. VKTX is currently developing its obesity drug candidate VK2735 in both oral and subcutaneous (SC) formulations. Viking Therapeutics is one of the few companies in this space that has made rapid and encouraging progress with its obesity drug.\nLast month, Viking announced that it has completed enrollment in a mid-stage study evaluating oral VK2735, just a couple of months after the study initiation was announced in January. This swift enrollment underscores the growing interest in VK2735 and reflects the rising momentum in the weight-loss drug market, led by the success of Lilly’s Zepbound and Novo’s Wegovy. A late-stage study on the SC version is expected to start before the end of this quarter.\nPfizer Inc. price | Pfizer Inc. Quote\nPfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

On Tuesday, Pfizer's stock closed the day 1.5% higher, providing a pleasant contrast to the S&P 500 index's 0.2% dip.

Both companies have seen their shares decline precipitously this year, with Rocket Lab down 25% and Intuitive Machines plummeting 57% since the start of the year, creating potentially attractive entry points for investors with longer time horizons and appropriate risk tolerance.\nShares of Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) and Structure Therapeutics (GPCR) are on the rise on Monday after Pfizer (PFE) announced its decision to discontinue development of danuglipron, an oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, which was being investigated for chronic weight management.

Somewhat counterintuitively, this week's rise came after the company announced it was ending the development of a drug in a very hot product category. On Tuesday, Pfizer's stock closed the day 1.5% higher, providing a pleasant contrast to the S&P 500 index's 0.2% dip.\nTuesday was a relatively uneventful news day for Pfizer, especially following the pharmaceutical giant's disclosure on Monday that it halted the development of its investigational weight loss drug danuglipron. This occurred after a patient suffered a liver injury during the testing of the medication. \nYet Pfizer watchers are well aware that the large and well-resourced company doesn't only have one pony in the race. It has a different treatment in its pipeline, PF-07976016, that's based on a different mechanism and is currently undergoing phase 2 clinical trials.\nOne analyst tracking the pharmaceutical stock didn't hesitate to point in a new research note published Tuesday morning that the company still has options. Bernstein SocGen's Courtney Breen wrote in her analysis, according to reports, that Pfizer will likely turn to its tried-and-true strategy of building up its pipeline with mergers and acquisitions, and/or licensing of products developed by peers. \nInvestors can be quite a hardy bunch, and collectively they seem to be shrugging off what many would consider a major setback in the lab with danuglipron. That being said, it is a setback, and Pfizer hasn't been a pharmaceutical pace-setter since the days of its Comirnaty vaccine during the coronavirus pandemic. The market is likely to start getting more impatient with the company soon.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Pfizer wasn’t one of them.

(NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to expand its recommendation for the use of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines approved for adults 50-59 years of age at increased risk of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD). This includes ABRYSVO® (Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine), which in October 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for the prevention of RSV-associated LRTD in adults aged 18 to 59 at increased risk of severe disease.\nAccording to the CDC, between 15,000 - 20,000 RSV-associated hospitalizations occur annually in U.S. adults aged 50 - 59 years.1 The risk of hospitalization is highest among those adults with one or more underlying medical conditions such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), asthma, and other chronic or immunocompromising conditions.1 With respect to ABRYSVO, ACIP stated:\nACIP recommends adults 50–59 years of age who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease receive a single dose of RSV vaccine.\n\"With its vote to expand adult RSV vaccination recommendations, ACIP has taken an important step toward protecting individuals aged 50 to 59 who have underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for severe RSV illness,\" said Alejandro Cane, Vice President, Vaccines and Antivirals U.S. Medical Lead, Pfizer. \"We are proud that ABRYSVO has the broadest indication among RSV vaccines, covering older adults, adults 18 and older at heightened risk of severe disease, and pregnant women to help protect infants.\"\nThe updated ACIP recommendation, which lowers the recommended age for RSV vaccination from 60 to 50 for high-risk adults, is pending final approval by the director of the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services.\nABOUT RSVRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a contagious virus and a common cause of respiratory illness.2 The virus can affect the lungs and breathing passages of an infected individual, potentially causing severe illness or death.3,4 Chronic cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, moderate or severe immune compromise, diabetes with complications, and severe obesity are among the conditions that increase an individual’s risk for severe RSV.5 There are two major subgroups of RSV: RSV-A and RSV-B. Both subgroups cause disease and can co-circulate or alternate predominance from season to season.\nABOUT ABRYSVOPfizer currently is the only company with an RSV vaccine to help protect adults aged 60 and older, and adults 18 and older at increased risk of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV (RSV-LRTD), as well as infants through maternal immunization. ABRYSVO is an unadjuvanted, bivalent vaccine that was designed to provide broad protection against RSV-LRTD, regardless of the virus subgroup. In the prefusion state, the RSV fusion protein (F) is a major target of neutralizing antibodies, serving as the basis of Pfizer’s RSV vaccine. Variations in the F protein sequence among RSV-A and RSV-B subgroups are clustered in a key antigenic site, a target for potent neutralizing antibodies.\nIn May 2023, the FDA approved ABRYSVO for the prevention of LRTD caused by RSV in individuals 60 years of age or older. In June 2024, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to update its recommendation of RSV vaccines for use in adults aged ≥75 years and adults age 60-74 years who are increased risk for severe RSV disease. In August 2023, the FDA approved ABRYSVO for the prevention of LRTD and severe LRTD caused by RSV in infants from birth up to 6 months of age by active immunization of pregnant individuals at 32 through 36 weeks gestational age. This was followed in September 2023 with ACIP’s recommendation for maternal immunization to help protect newborns from RSV seasonally where the vaccine should be administered from September through January in most of the continental United States.\nAlso in August 2023, Pfizer announced that the European Commission granted marketing authorization for ABRYSVO for both older adults and maternal immunization to help protect infants, and in March 2025 announced the amended marketing authorization to extend the indication to include a broader adult population. Additionally, ABRYSVO has received approvals for both indications in multiple countries worldwide.\nINDICATIONS FOR ABRYSVO\nABRYSVO® is a vaccine indicated in the U.S. for:\nthe prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in people 60 years of age and older\nthe prevention of LRTD caused by RSV in people 18 through 59 years of age who are at increased risk for LRTD caused by RSV\npregnant individuals at 32 through 36 weeks gestational age for the prevention of LRTD and severe LRTD caused by RSV in infants from birth through 6 months of age\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR ABRYSVO\nABRYSVO should not be given to anyone with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any of its components\nAn increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (severe muscle weakness) was observed after vaccination with ABRYSVO\nFor pregnant individuals: to avoid the potential risk of preterm birth, ABRYSVO should be given during 32 through 36 weeks gestational age\nFainting can happen after getting injectable vaccines, including ABRYSVO.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other best medical stocks to buy according to billionaires.\nSome experts view medical, healthcare, and big pharma stocks as immune from trade carnage, making them a safe haven amid the uncertainty brought about by Trump’s tariffs. On April 8, Mizuho Securities America healthcare sector strategist Jared Holz appeared on CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ to talk about whether the speculations around the healthcare sector being a safe haven during market turmoil are true. He also discussed why healthcare companies are failing to get increased investor respect, given that healthcare is 20% of the American economy, which translates to around 1/5th of the country’s entire national output.\nHolz said that the country’s major healthcare and pharmaceutical companies undoubtedly help fight its healthcare problems. However, when we look at their financial models and the way their businesses are currently set up, we have got generic patent cliffs over the next 5-7 years on the medium to long-term angle of the company, along with price concessions with the IRA and some of the things the Biden administration put into place. We have also got pricing degradation over the near term, and between those two lies competition and other setbacks. The models thus never line up well enough for investors to have a lot of confidence, as the business models do not lend themselves to long-term viability. These are the primary reasons the sector and stocks have been under pressure for so long.\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Mid Cap Biotech Stocks to Buy and 12 Best Diagnostics Stocks to Invest In Right Now. \nHolz further opined that managed care, particularly the government-centric names, are somewhat safe as they are insulated from tariffs as US-based companies. In fact, the economic slowdown is actually beneficial for them as they want less utilization and less patience through the system, which is how they typically beat numbers. He said that managed care is having a good day, and investors might think about owning some companies in the sector.\nIt is, however, a relative game, as there are several different variables at play, and investors are essentially playing a game of hopscotch in an attempt to jump from one area to another, whether it’s tariffs, drug pricing, or other public policies. He painted a similar picture for medical device stocks that are more US-centric. These two sectors thus have less risk relative to others, making them somewhat of a safe haven.\nIn this article, we first sifted through ETFs and financial media reports to compile a preliminary list of stocks. We then examined Insider Monkey’s exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to select the 10 best medical stocks with the most billionaire investors. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA senior healthcare professional giving advice to a patient in a clinic.\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 23\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 150\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) provides healthcare coverage, data consultancy, and software services. It operates through the OptumRx, OptumInsight, OptumHealth, and UnitedHealthCare segments, which have solid operations. UnitedHealthcare, its insurance division, added millions of customers during fiscal 2024 and is continuing to expand its operations. Its OptumHealth division grew revenues to around $105 billion in fiscal 2024 and is expected to touch $117 billion in fiscal 2025.\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) also employed around $17 billion in growth capital in fiscal 2024 to strengthen its capabilities and returned over $16 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) expects cash flow from operations to reach $33 billion in fiscal 2025, or 1.2 times net income.\nOn April 9, Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes raised the firm’s price target on UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) to $650 from $600 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The company takes the second spot on our list of the best medical stocks to invest in now.\nVulcan Value Partners stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), a company that we have owned several times in the past, is the largest health insurer in the United States. UnitedHealth Group also owns Optum, which is a rapidly growing healthcare services company. The environment for the health insurance business remains positive as growth in healthcare spending, driven by chronic diseases and an aging population, will continue to outpace overall economic growth. The insurance business benefits from powerful network effects as more members attract more providers and vice versa, which reinforces United’s value proposition and bargaining power with each side of the network. We respect UnitedHealth Group’s management team and have been very pleased with their long-term vision and execution.”\nOverall, UNH ranks 2nd on our list of best medical stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential for UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is currently pegged at $7.27 per shareon revenues of $111.01 billion.\nSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.\nFirst-quarter earnings estimates have remained stable over the past week. The bottom-line projection indicates an increase of 5.2% from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests year-over-year growth of 11.2%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor the current year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth’s revenues is pegged at $451.24 billion, implying a rise of 12.7% year over year. Also, the consensus mark for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $29.73, implying a jump of around 7.5% on a year-over-year basis.\nUnitedHealthhas a robust history of surpassing earnings estimates, beating the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters, with the average surprise being 2.5%. This is depicted in the figure below.\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Quote\nHowever, our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for the company this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, but that’s not the case here.\nUNH has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nUnitedHealth's first-quarter earnings are expected to have benefited from higher premiums, driven by the expansion of its domestic commercial membership base. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premium revenues for the first quarter indicates 11.5% year-over-year growth, whereas our model estimate suggests a nearly 9% increase. Higher contributions from both Optum Health and UnitedHealthcare divisions are expected to have supported premium growth.\nUNH's first-quarter top-line performance is expected to have been enhanced by a rise in service revenues from the Optum brand. Both the consensus estimate and our model estimate imply a nearly 10% jump in service revenues. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for product revenues indicates an almost 12% increase.\nValue-based care expansion in Optum Health, new client wins at Optum Rx,and enhanced technology-enabled offerings are major tailwinds for the company’s results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from the Optum business segment suggests a 28.6% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from UnitedHealthcare indicates 7.6% year-over-year growth. These are expected to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth in the first quarter.\nNow, let’s focus on memberships in selected programs. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealthcare’s total domestic commercial customers suggests 3.5% year-over-year growth, whereas our estimate implies a nearly 2% gain. The consensus mark for Medicare Advantage members indicates a 5.8% year-over-year rise.\nHowever, the consensus estimate for Medicaid memberships implies a 0.8% decline from the year-ago level. Also, international memberships are expected to have declined in the quarter under review due to divestments. These are likely to have pulled total memberships down from the year-ago period. The consensus estimate implies a 0.6% fall year over year.\nRising medical costs, as seniors continue resuming elective procedures,are expected to have elevated UnitedHealth’s overall expenses in the quarter. The expected growth in healthcare utilization, especially in the Medicare Advantage space, might have affected margins, making an earnings beat uncertain this time around. Our model estimate for total operating costs indicates an 8.6% increase from the prior-year period.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNH’s medical care ratio is pegged at 85.92%, up from 84.3% in the year-ago quarter. Our estimates for medical costs and costs of products soldindicate 10% and 9.1% year-over-year increases, respectively.\nUnitedHealth's stock has jumped 18.5% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s growth of 18%. Its peers, such as Humana Inc. HUM and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH, have gained 16.3% and 18.6%, respectively, during this time. All these stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, which has plunged 9.1% during the same period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNow, let’s look at the value UnitedHealth offers investors at current levels.\nThe company’s valuation looks a bit stretched compared with the industry average. Currently, UNH is trading at 19.47X forward 12 months earnings, slightly above its five-year median of 19.20X and above the industry’s average of 16.71X. In comparison, Humana and Molina Healthcare are currently trading at 19.17X and 13.60X, respectively.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nUnitedHealth’s strategic investments in technology and value-based care — particularly through its Optum segment — continue to position the company as a frontrunner in healthcare innovation. This emphasis not only drives operational efficiency but also improves patient outcomes, a key advantage as the industry increasingly shifts toward quality-based models.\nWith projected annual earnings growth of 12.4% over the next five years, UnitedHealth remains a compelling long-term investment. The company’s strong cash flow underpins consistent shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases, reinforcing its financial stability and disciplined capital allocation.\nAdding to the bullish case, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently approved a 5.06% increase in Medicare Advantage (MA) payments for fiscal 2026, a sharp revision from the initially proposed 2.23%. This development is expected to meaningfully boost profitability for top-tier MA providers like UnitedHealth and Humana.\nWe anticipate that UnitedHealth will extend its profit growth trajectory in the upcoming earnings report, likely supporting continued stock price momentum. The company’s push toward managing costs effectively — through disciplined contract negotiations and optimized patient discharge processes — should further enhance margins. Given its strong fundamentals, long-term growth outlook, and favorable policy backdrop, UnitedHealth’s premium valuation appears justified.

Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific UnitedHealth metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\nAnalysts expect 'Revenues- Products' to come in at $13.33 billion.

However, the trends in March are not so different from what's happening now, as consumer sentiment was rapidly weakening and fears of a recession were mounting before the tariff announcement.\nLet's take a look at the two best-performing Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI -1.73%) companies to see if they're worth buying today.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.30%) is one of the most resilient stocks on the market. Healthcare is considered a recession-proof industry, but health insurance is even more unaffected by the economy because people need coverage regardless.\nIt's not a surprise, then, that investors have piled into the stock in March and have continued to do so through the tariff-related chaos of April.\nThere was no major company-specific news out on UnitedHealth in March, and investors seem to be returning to the stock after it tumbled following the assassination of one of its executives in December 2024.\nUnitedHealth has been one of the rare winners on the stock market in April, gaining 15% thanks to a 5.06% increase in Medicare Advantage benchmarks and its reputation as a port in a storm during turbulent market times.\nChevron (CVX 0.65%) might seem like a surprise on this list as the energy sector is typically highly sensitive to the economic cycle.\nThe source of Chevron's gains was a surprising one, as Reuters reported that the company was angling for a piece of the data center market, developing the sites and supplying the electricity for facilities. \nData center demand is surging along with AI, and the energy to power it is at a premium.\nHowever, while that was a smart strategic move, it wasn't enough to keep the stock climbing in April as it fell sharply after tariffs were announced. Chevron will continue to be sensitive to the health of the global economy and oil prices.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in UnitedHealth Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and UnitedHealth Group wasn’t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, described the 145% duty on China as so extreme that it essentially acts as an embargo rather than a conventional tariff.\n“We now have 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, a number that high frankly isn’t really a tariff. It’s more of an embargo. Almost nobody’s gonna pay that much of a markup. It’s a recipe for losing money.”\nREAD ALSO 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently and Jim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks\nCramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump’s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. “As a nation, shamefully, we’ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,” he said\n“I think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.”\nCramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. “Yes, we have to take them on now or never,” he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept.\n“So the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it’s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it’s not worth it to go back… [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I’m actually thinking that might be where we’\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 150\nCommenting on how people are investing in light of tariffs, Cramer mentioned UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) and said:\n“Is the market reflecting any of this? No, but something else is happening too. People are investing in companies, just started yesterday, that don’t have all that much exposure to China or none. You can see it in healthcare, excluding drugs, which are still facing the possibility of their own set of tariffs. UnitedHealth Group and Humana are good examples. They were up once again. I mean it’s really incredible. Former up nearly 3%, The latter up 2%.”\nUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is a healthcare company that provides health benefit plans, care delivery, pharmacy services, and health management programs. It supplies software, consulting, and data products to businesses in the healthcare industry.\nParnassus Investments stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n“We sold two Health Care positions during the quarter, pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and insurerUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). UnitedHealth’s business model is becoming higher-risk, which coupled with slowing Medicare Advantage growth and regulatory uncertainty led to us exiting the position.\nOverall, UNH ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said he was considering a modification to the 25% tariffs imposed on foreign auto and auto parts imports from Mexico, Canada and other places.  That followed the move late on Friday to exempt smartphones, computers and some other electronics from Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs.\nWe recently published a list of the 11 Best Dividend Paying Stocks According to Hedge Funds.

In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\nBelow, we take a look at UnitedHealth Group (UNH), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. UnitedHealth Group currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for UNH that show why this largest U.S. health insurer shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\nFor UNH, shares are up 14.17% over the past week while the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry is up 1.21% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 22.68% compares favorably with the industry's 2.76% performance as well.\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of UnitedHealth Group have risen 17.6%, and are up 36.49% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved -7.64% and 4.64%, respectively.\nInvestors should also pay attention to UNH's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. UNH is currently averaging 5,807,295 shares for the last 20 days.\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with UNH.\nOver the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost UNH's consensus estimate, increasing from $29.63 to $29.73 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that UNH is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep UnitedHealth Group on your short list.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "Title: The fallout from UnitedHealth’s CEO slaying\nDate: 2025-04-15 08:00\nURL: https://www.pharmavoice.com/news/united-healthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-pharma-pbm-moderna-pfizer/745309/?.tsrc=rss\nContent:\nLet PharmaVoice’s free newsletter keep you informed on what industry leaders are saying, straight from your inbox.\n                    \n                \n            \n\nBrian Thompson’s murder has raised questions about the cost of U.S. healthcare, embroiling insurers, drugmakers and PBMs in a battle for the future of the industry.\nWhat started as the shocking murder of a healthcare executive has now become a watershed moment for an entire industry.\nBrian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was gunned down in December while walking along a Manhattan sidewalk. After an intense manhunt, the suspected assailant was caught and identified as Luigi Mangione.\nThe case against 26-year-old Mangione, which includes state and federal charges, is moving swiftly. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced earlier this month that the Justice Department will seek the death penalty against Mangione, who allegedly wrote the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” on shell casings used in the murder of the health insurance executive. Mangione’s lawyers have since asked a federal judge to block the DOJ’s attempt at capital punishment.\nAnd while Mangione’s courtroom drama unfolds, the slaying’s impact is still rippling through the healthcare industry, from payers to pharma.\nNews of the murder uncorked long-simmering outrage across the country over insurer profits and patients’ struggles to pay for healthcare. Scrutiny of UnitedHealth — the largest U.S. health insurance company — has quickly intensified.\nWith a market capitalization of over $400 billion, UnitedHealth brings in as much revenue as the tech giant Apple. \nLaunched in the 1970s in Minnesota, the insurance company built its empire through a string of deals that expanded its reach. Several large acquisitions deepened United’s investment into the Medicare coverage field. It also swallowed up several insurance competitors, bought hundreds of surgical sites, became a player in the home health industry and launched a pharmacy benefit manager called Optum Rx.\nThroughout its history, UnitedHealth has been embroiled in controversies that include antitrust suits and a stock manipulation scandal in 2006 that led its CEO to resign.\nBefore Thompson was murdered, UnitedHealth was being investigated by the DOJ for potential antitrust activities, and PBMs in general have been under a microscope from U.S. lawmakers over their role in drug pricing. Now, more revelations have turned the heat up on UnitedHealth’s business dealings in the fraught U.S. healthcare system.\nA range of policymakers and regulators are unpacking more about the company’s far-reaching business — and United is fighting back by blaming the pharma industry and other players in healthcare. Meanwhile, industry executives have been shoring up security as distrust and criticisms of the industry mount. \nThe killing of a chief executive shed light on the disparities inherent in a system that rewards corporate profit-seeking while leaving millions of patients unable to afford life-saving medications.\nKeep up with the story. Subscribe to the PharmaVoice free daily newsletter\nBefore Thompson’s assassination, UnitedHealth was raking in billions from price hikes from 2017 to 2022 on drugs for patients with conditions like heart disease and cancer, according to a report from the Federal Trade Commission. \nAlong with fellow PBMs Cigna and CVS Health, drug markups with percentages sometimes in the thousands drove revenue of $7.3 billion above what they paid for the drugs in the first place, the regulator said.\nInvestigators have found that these companies allegedly continue to pump up revenues through extralegal means. An audit in Tennessee revealed that Cigna’s Express Scripts in 2023 mishandled transactions with pharmacies to keep from paying reimbursements.\nUnitedHealth has also raked in profit from government insurers like Medicare. Through Medicare Advantage, PBMs made about $33 billion in 2021 from coding diagnoses that exaggerated patients’ conditions to pull in more from the program, and UnitedHealth made up about half of those additional payments, according to a report in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\nIn response to the scrutiny, United hasn’t conceded much with its business model. Instead, the insurance giant has blamed the pharma industry.\nDuring the company’s end-of-year earnings call in January, UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty pointed to the high cost of drugs in the U.S. compared to other countries and specifically called out GLP-1 drugmakers, noting that “one drug which costs $900 in the U.S. costs about a tenth of that in Europe.” He also defended the role of Optum Rx in negotiating “many tens of billions of dollars in savings” for patients and passing through 98% of rebates directly to patients. \nBeyond drug prices, Witty said that hospitals benefit from higher costs for healthcare services. The comments came as the company declared record revenues in 2024 that topped $400 billion.\nIn the months since, United has made at least one notable change on the PBM side: Optum Rx will stop requiring reauthorizations for around 80 drugs. The move will eliminate some paperwork burdens for physicians and patients and cut about 10% of Optum’s prior authorizations, the PBM said in March. \nPrior authorizations, which require providers to receive approval from a patient’s insurance plan before providing a service or drug, are a major source of discontent among providers and patients. UnitedHealthcare also said last month that it planned to reduce 10% of prior authorizations this year.\nWhile much of the public ire related to the Thompson murder has been directed at health insurers, a range of companies are investing in beefed up security for their top executives.\nOver 70% of companies across industries have security plans in place for their top leaders, according to a survey conducted by HR Policy Association released earlier this year. While 37% focus their security efforts solely on the CEO, nearly 70% provide protection for all C-suite executives, and most use third-party contractors. Over half of the 180 respondents to the survey said they are prioritizing security for travel and physical safety in 2025.\nIn pharma, the increased emphasis on safety was acutely felt at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco in January, which is one of the industry’s largest events of the year. The San Francisco Police Department added barriers and checkpoints to the event’s main hub — the Westin St. Francis hotel — and canceled some officers’ days off to make sure the event was fully staffed.\nProxy statements released this year have also revealed just how much large pharmas are shelling out to protect their executives. About $960,000 of Moderna’s CEO pay package for Stéphane Bancel was used for security in 2024.\nPfizer spent more than $661,000 to protect CEO Albert Bourla, while Gilead Sciences reported more than $285,000 in security services for CEO Daniel O’Day. In general, other large pharmas — including Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly — spent between $70,000 and $200,000 on CEO security last year.\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry leaders\nBrian Thompson’s murder has raised questions about the cost of U.S. healthcare, embroiling insurers, drugmakers and PBMs in a battle for the future of the industry.\nSubscribe to PharmaVoice for important stories, insights & perspectives\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry leaders\nBrian Thompson’s murder has raised questions about the cost of U.S. healthcare, embroiling insurers, drugmakers and PBMs in a battle for the future of the industry.\nThe free newsletter covering the top industry headlines\nFacing price negotiations, patent cliffs and trade tariffs, big pharma is refining its strategy.

If the sales are approved, UnitedHealth would only operate 10% of home health and 4% of hospice services in the U.S.\nStill, the offers have not proved sufficient for the DOJ, which has grown increasingly concerned about the size and influence of UnitedHealth — a company that operates one of the largest insurers in the nation, a major pharmacy benefit manager and a healthcare technology company, while employing thousands of physicians.\nThe DOJ is reportedly investigating the conglomerate for its potential anticompetitive effects, including the relationship between Optum and its insurer UnitedHealthcare.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other best dividend-paying stocks.\nDividend-paying stocks have consistently attracted investor interest due to their long-term value. CNBC highlights this by examining the historical performance of the broader market. Between 1960 and 2024, a $10,000 investment in the index would have grown to over $982,000 purely from stock price appreciation, based on data from FactSet and NYU Stern. However, many companies in the index also returned capital to shareholders through dividends. Had an investor reinvested those dividends over the years, the investment would have ballooned to approximately $6.42 million by the beginning of 2025.\nThis outlook seems reasonable, especially when considering how crucial cash flow has become in today’s economic environment. Investors continue to favor income-generating assets, and dividends remain one of the most reliable ways to deliver that income. Reflecting this trend, several companies within the market have recently introduced dividend payments.\nAccording to S&P Global, companies in the S&P index now contribute roughly 85% of the total dividends paid across the market—up from 82% in 2024. This increase includes 2.7% of the total dividend pool coming from firms that only recently began issuing dividends. The top 29 companies in the index alone are responsible for 40% of all dividends paid by the index’s constituents and 35% of the total dividends across the entire US equity market. Under the current base-case forecast, these leading firms are expected to distribute a combined $280 billion in dividends. In a more optimistic (upside) scenario, that figure could climb by 2.75% to $288 billion, with major large cap companies projected to deliver the most significant gains by weighted average. If the most favorable (bull-case) conditions materialize, these 29 companies could boost total dividend payouts by an estimated 4.5%, contributing an additional 1% themselves.\nIt’s no surprise, then, that dividends have become a central theme in many investors’ strategies. According to Brian Bollinger, founder of Simply Safe Dividends, focusing on companies that regularly pay dividends can offer a sense of reassurance. He further noted that younger investors, in particular, have the opportunity to build long-term dividend growth portfolios aimed at maximizing total return and capital appreciation over time.\nAccording to Nuveen, companies that focus on dividend growth tend to possess strong long-term fundamentals and may deliver relatively attractive performance in the year ahead. Historically, firms that consistently increased or initiated dividend payments have produced higher annualized returns and exhibited lower volatility compared to the broader equity market. While such companies may not lead in every market environment, their favorable risk-adjusted returns over extended periods make them a solid foundation for equity portfolios.\nNuveen also suggested that many firms remain in a strong position to continue raising dividends over time. In the US, corporate balance sheets are generally healthy, consumer spending remains steady, and earnings growth is projected to pick up pace in 2025. Data from FactSet shows that dividends per share for the S&P index rose by 7.6% in 2024, with consensus forecasts pointing to a further 4.2% increase in 2025.\nA senior healthcare professional giving advice to a patient in a clinic.\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of the close of Q4 2024. From the top 60 companies, we selected 11 dividend stocks with yields of at least 1% as of April 12. These companies show strong financial performance and have solid records of paying dividends. The stocks are ranked according to the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 150\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is an American health insurance company. It is well-positioned for steady growth thanks to its broad-based business model, which spans health insurance, pharmacy benefit management, and healthcare services. This integrated setup not only enhances care efficiency but also boosts cross-selling opportunities. The stock is returning strong returns this year, surging by nearly 19% since the start of 2025.\nAnalysts have praised the company’s ability to trim its operating cost ratio, which dropped to 13.2% in 2024 from 14.7% the previous year, largely due to strategic adjustments in its business portfolio—moves that support long-term profitability.\nIn fiscal 2024, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) surpassed investor expectations, with revenue climbing 8% to $400 billion, supported by solid performance across all service areas. Operating earnings came in at $32.3 billion, and after accounting for expenses tied to a cyberattack and difficulties in South America, adjusted earnings totaled $34.4 billion.\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) also maintained robust cash flow, generating $24.2 billion in operating cash flow, equivalent to 1.6 times its net income. It returned more than $16 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. The company’s return on equity reached 23.7% in the fourth quarter, reflecting both strong earnings and effective capital allocation. UnitedHealth paid a quarterly dividend of $2.10 per share, yielding 1.40%, as of April 12.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on UNH. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH)'s share was trading at $587.06 as of April 14th. UNH’s trailing and forward P/E were 37.85 and 19.72 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nValeri Potapova/Shutterstock.com\nUnitedHealth Group stands as a powerful compounder in the healthcare space, benefiting from the defensive nature of health insurance—a category of spending that consumers prioritize even during economic downturns. In uncertain times, discretionary expenses like tech upgrades, dining out, and travel are often the first to go, but health insurance remains untouchable due to the catastrophic financial consequences of going uninsured. This dynamic gives health insurers, especially UnitedHealth, exceptional pricing power, allowing them to pass on rising costs without losing customers. UnitedHealth’s dominance is underpinned by its vertical integration, particularly through its health services arm, Optum, which continues to grow at a healthy clip above 10% annually. Despite recent concerns sparked by the tragic death of its insurance CEO and skepticism voiced by Bill Ackman regarding profitability, the company’s fundamentals remain unshaken. These events created temporary dislocations in the stock, which long-term believers used as buying opportunities. UnitedHealth’s revenue has compounded at 11% annually over the past five years, and despite modest net profit and return on equity margins at 5%, the consistency and resilience of its business model position it as a reliable performer in all market conditions. Its forward P/E of 20 reflects a fair valuation, especially considering the current environment. The stock has already gained 22% year-to-date, outperforming a declining S&P 500, and still presents a compelling opportunity for investors—particularly on any dip below the $550 level. For those seeking tariff-proof exposure with strong cost-passing capabilities and a resilient growth engine, UnitedHealth remains a top-tier choice. The combination of its indispensable service, stable financials, and strategic integration make it a long-term winner, regardless of market cycles.\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) is on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\nOn Friday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer outlined what investors should focus on in the week, especially pointing to earnings reports from major banks.\n“Rumor, innuendo, intrigue these are the stuff of great novels, of fabulous miniseries, riveting plays, and now they’re the stuff of the stock market.”\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks and 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently.\nHe noted the chaotic nature of the current environment and remarked that “this tape has it all,” and emphasized how unpredictable developments from the White House have added to the turbulence. Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes.\n“Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,” he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, “Except this isn’t an eight-part blockbuster, it’s our money.” Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday’s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic.\nCramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a “liberation day bottom,” a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, “Not sure, I’m just not sure.” He added:\n“Have you ever noticed the weekends don’t provide relaxation anymore because the president’s got advisors? He’s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He’s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime…. Monday’s trading, well, let’s just say that it looks like that it’s earning season so it’s gonna be even harder than usual.”\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.

Both companies have transformed beyond their original identities — CVS Health from a retail pharmacy chain into a healthcare powerhouse through its acquisition of Aetna and UnitedHealth from a traditional insurer into a tech-enabled care provider via its expansive Optum platform. Each now combines insurance, care delivery, pharmacy benefit management (PBM) and value-based service models to offer end-to-end healthcare solutions.\nFor investors, it is difficult to choose between the two, as both CVS and UnitedHealth continue to diversify their revenue streams and scale up their clinical and digital infrastructure. While they share structural similarities in business segmentation — insurance, health services, and pharmacy operations — their financial trajectories, operating margins, capital deployment strategies and risk exposures differ notably. Let’s examine which is the stronger buy right now.\nAfter a rough 2024, marked by high utilization at its Aetna insurance unit as well as reimbursement pressure, CVS Health has experienced a dramatic recovery so far in 2025. The stock has become the S&P 500’s top performer, with a year-to-date return of 56%, thereby outperforming all other index members by a significant margin. UnitedHealth, on the other hand, is at number 16 on the chart with a 16.5% gain. The stocks, however, outperformed the benchmark’s 8% dip during this period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAetna Margin Recovery and Cost Efficiencies in Focus: CVS Health is prioritizing margin recovery in its Aetna business, which posted 23% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter despite an adjusted operating loss. Favorable reserve developments and less severe-than-expected medical trends supported the performance. For 2025, CVS Health projects $132 billion in healthcare benefits revenues and at least $1.5 billion in adjusted operating income, with a 100-basis-point Medical Benefit Ratio improvement to 91.5%.\nWhile Medicare Advantage and individual exchange membership may decline, these are expected to be offset by growth in commercial self-insured plans and stronger plan design. The company is also executing a $2 billion multi-year cost efficiency initiative with 2025 savings expected to fully absorb rising variable expenses.\nStrong Cash Flow Generation and Shareholders’ Return: CVS Health’s 2024 operating cash flow of $9.1 billion exceeded expectations due to early cash receipts from the pharmacy segment. While 2025 guidance projects $6.5 billion in cash flow from operations, the two-year outlook of $15.6 billion in cumulative operating cash flows is a strong indicator of financial stability and flexibility. The company returned $3.3 billion in dividends in 2024 and expects to maintain dividend payments in 2025. It executed debt management strategies to moderately reduce leverage despite interest expense headwinds, with a long-term focus on regaining investment-grade targets.\nReimbursement Issues, Cyberattack Fail to Mar UNH's Momentum: In 2024, UnitedHealth faced substantial external pressure in the form of CMS Medicare rate cuts, Medicaid redeterminations and the Change Healthcare cyberattack. Despite these, the company deployed nearly $17 billion in growth capital to further strengthen its capabilities. It also returned over $16 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, highlighting the company's financial strength and disciplined capital allocation.\nFor 2025, UnitedHealth expects cash flow from operations to approach $33 billion, or 1.2x net income — a clear sign of robust underlying profitability.\nUNH's Shift Toward Value-Based Care with Optum: Optum Health’s revenues are set to grow from $105 billion in 2024 to $117 billion in 2025, with value-based care reaching 5.4 million patients, up 650,000 driven by services like in-home care. Optum Rx expects revenue growth with 98% retention and 750 new clients, expanding in specialty and infusion services while curbing drug costs.\nBullish Outlook for 2025 and Beyond: UnitedHealth cut its 2024 operating cost ratio by 150 basis points, aided by early AI-driven productivity gains. It is also moving to fully transparent pharmacy rebate models by 2028 to strengthen client trust. Despite a 150-basis-point medical care ratio (MCR) variance in 2024, UNH has proactively priced for 2025, targeting an 86.5% +/-50 bps MCR, supported by strong retention, growing Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) adoption and broader managed care offerings.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVS’ 2025 earnings per share suggests an 8.7% improvement from 2024.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNH’s 2025 EPS implies an improvement of 7.5% over the previous fiscal.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCVS is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing healthcare stocks, of 11.25X, above its 5-year median of 9.25X and pretty close to the 5-year high of 13.33X. Meanwhile, UNH is presently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings of 19.06X, which is below its 5-year median and high of 19.20X and 26.63X respectively.\nThis suggests that while UNH may appear slightly elevated relative to CVS, it remains attractively valued when compared with its own historical average.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile both companies present compelling long-term value, UNH, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, currently stands out with stronger margins, cash flow, and a below-average P/E despite growth across Optum. CVS Health, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, meanwhile, is grappling with challenges like elevated medical costs and shifting payer dynamics in Medicare Advantage. The company recently established a \"baseline with upside potential\" strategy, signaling cautious optimism and operational discipline.\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Read our full analysis here, it’s free.\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting UnitedHealth’s revenue to grow 11.7% year on year to $111.5 billion, improving from the 8.6% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $7.29 per share.\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings.

What the president did was say, OK, look, we’re not going to continue to punish American companies and give the green light to Korea. I don’t know if you heard Lutnick’s words. He was very specific. Southeast Asia. That’s Samsung. They didn’t want to give the ball to Samsung.”\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Hints at a Bigger Agenda Behind Tariffs and Breaks Down These 7 Stocks and Jim Cramer Reacts to the Surprise Market Surge and Highlights 8 Key Stocks.\nTurning to currency dynamics, Cramer pushed back on what he sees as misplaced panic over a weakening U.S. dollar. Instead, he argued that a softer dollar actually benefits American multinationals and gives long-needed relief to CFOs who’ve spent years blaming currency strength for lost market share:\n“Well, look, I’m not so certain I’m going to do a little contrary stuff on the dollar here. When we listen to conference calls, for the last four years, all we hear about is it would have been so much better if the dollar weren’t so strong. We keep losing share, the dollar’s too strong. Suddenly the dollar’s weaker, and now we start hearing all the downside, what, the bonds? I mean, I’m almost thinking that, I’m gonna put this out there, the people who are saying that it’s the end of the world, that the dollar is weaker, I think they have to go do some work boots on the ground. […] So suddenly the dollar’s weaker and we are petrified? These are people who have an agenda. And their agenda is to say, you know what matters more than anything else? Our hegemony from a strong dollar. And I don’t get it. If you’re in our business of picking stocks, you’re sick and tired of hearing CFOs say, we are done. We’ve got to stop this dollar rise.”\nCramer also gave his opinion about the rhetoric coming from Beijing, likening it to the Cold War-era paranoia of the 1960s and ’70s. He questioned whether a diplomatic breakthrough similar to Nixon’s historic visit to China is even possible under the current tone of U.S.-China relations:\n“But when I listen to the rhetoric from China, this is the 1968-72 rhetoric. It’s the kind of rhetoric that just says there’s never going to be a meeting. Is there a way to have a Nixon to China moment? Because as far as I’m concerned, this is just right now you’re on the verge of when I was a little boy and we kept thinking, when are they going to bomb us? I mean, that was the same rhetoric. When are they going to launch their nuclear weapons? I mean, that’s why we used to live in fear. That’s why we had cubbyholes. That’s why we used to put our heads in a cubbyhole, because the Chinese were going to bomb us if the Russians didn’t bomb us. This is the same sound.”\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on April 14th.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA senior healthcare professional giving advice to a patient in a clinic.\nNumber of Hedge Fund holders: 150\nAhead of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)’s upcoming earnings release, Jim Cramer made an emphatic bullish prediction. He praised the company’s historical performance, consistency in exceeding expectations, and strategic consolidation efforts that strengthened its industry dominance. Here’s what he said:\n“Yeah, it’s a better than expected. It’s a much better than expected quarter, and I’m raising numbers. Well, that’s all they ever do. I’ve never seen them not. Maybe one quarter in the last 10 years. It’s an amazing company. I remember I was long it in 1989 and made my whole year. This thing was just a juggernaut from day one. Remember when they bought everybody too? Remember the consolidation? That was a really good thing for the industry. There’s an opportunity here.”\nOverall, UNH ranks 4th on our list of key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes. While we acknowledge the potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Let’s take a closer look at each.\nColorado-based Newmont is one of the world's largest producers of gold, owning several active mines in Nevada, Peru, Australia, and Ghana. The surge in gold prices has been the driving factor behind the stock’s strong YTD performance, up nearly 50%.\nNotably, the average gold price per oz reached $2,643 throughout its latest period, melting higher from the $2,004 mark in the same period last year. Free cash flow of $1.6 billion throughout the period was the company’s highest read ever.\nBelow is a chart illustrating NEM’s free cash flow on a quarterly basis. The amplified cash-generating abilities are a huge positive, allowing the company to shell out dividend payments or pay down any debt.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe favorable gold environment has led analysts to up their EPS expectations across the board, with NEM now sporting a very bullish near-term outlook.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nUnitedHealth offers a full spectrum of health benefits, with its Optum segment using data and technology to improve care delivery and health outcomes. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its EPS outlook inching higher across nearly all timeframes over the past couple of months.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIt’s critical to note that the company is scheduled to report quarterly results this week, with our current consensus expectations alluding to 5% YoY EPS growth on 11% higher sales. The company has been a stellar earnings performer overall, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate in each of its last 20 quarterly releases.\nIts results are expected on Thursday, April 17th, before the market’s open. Investors should also note that the company is largely shielded from any tariff worries thanks to its domestic operations within the U.S.\nSFM shares have been strong thanks to robust quarterly results, with the company exceeding both consensus EPS and sales expectations in each of its last ten quarters. Up nearly 160% over the last year, the stock has crushed the S&P 500.\nContinued sales growth has pleased investors, with SFM reporting double-digit percentage YoY sales growth rates in each of its last three periods. Sales of $2.0 billion throughout its latest period grew an impressive 17% from the year-ago mark, reflective of a strong demand picture overall.\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company’s sales on a quarterly basis.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe stock also sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with its EPS outlook shifting notably bullish across the board. The company’s next set of results come on April 30th.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nWhile the market continues to digest tariff headlines and other economic developments, all three stocks above – UnitedHealth UNH, Newmont NEM, and Sprouts Farmers Market SFM – have all been climbing higher, with each also sporting bullish near-term EPS outlooks.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\nOn Friday, Mad Money host, Jim Cramer, shared his perspective on how investors might approach the stock market given the current economic uncertainty.\n“You gotta make a list and decide what you can live with and what’s simply too dicey to buy. That my good friends, is how you have to think about stocks right now if you’re willing to be a slave to this crazy market in order to try to pocket what you can during this difficult period.”\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks.\nCramer emphasized that before making any trading decision unless the plan is to hold it long-term and ride out near-term turbulence, investors should run what he described as a “gauntlet” of significant considerations. The first question he raised is whether the company in question does business in any foreign country. While it is common for investors to be cautious about China these days, Cramer pointed out that any nation could suddenly draw the ire of the U.S. president.\n“Now, it’s one thing to be worried about China, but it’s another to recognize that any country could at any time find itself on the president’s bad side. And once they get on his bad side, any American company doing real business there, finished.”\nCramer stressed the importance of avoiding companies that rely on international operations or resources. The second point on his checklist involved evaluating whether a company is cyclical, essentially, if it is vulnerable to swings in the broader economy. Highlighting the scale of the current trade friction, Cramer pointed out that the United States is effectively embargoing $439 billion worth of goods from China. He noted that it is likely to push inflation to levels not seen in a very long time. He added:\n“It’s hard to disagree with that assessment and I say that as someone who generally supports a trade crackdown on the Chinese government.”\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA senior healthcare professional giving advice to a patient in a clinic.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 150\nDiscussing health insurers like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Cramer said:\n“Then there are the health insurers, Humana, UnitedHealth, and Cigna. They are the ones I have my eyes on. They’re the easiest spot and we want them easy. I know the Charitable Trust should own one of these. I’m just debating which one.”\nUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) offers health benefit plans, care services, pharmacy support, and health management programs. It also provides software tools, consulting, and data solutions to organizations in the healthcare field. In the beginning of April, Cramer stated:\n“Right now, there’ll be a lot of fund managers who say, why do I need any of this? Just give me stocks that are American stocks that have nothing to do. And UnitedHealth, which sells at 19 times earnings, would probably sell at 25 times earnings in the near-term future, because UnitedHealth actually defines what I’m telling you people want. Up another 12 today. And that’s how money managers work. They’ll buy Umana, they’ll buy UNH, they’ll buy Cigna. […] You’re going to hear people come on, like on two-stock lunch or whatever, and they’re going to say, you know what? I like UnitedHealth and Humana here. Why? Well, they’re totally independent. Totally domestic.”\nOverall, UNH ranks 7th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2445093/energy-stocks-take-a-dive-values-or-traps\nWelcome to Episode #401 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n \n(0:15) - Can You Find Value In The Energy Industry or Are They Traps?\n(6:30) - Tracey Takes A Deep Dive Into 3 Stocks To Consider For Your Portfolio\n(32:20) - Episode Roundup: XOM, CVX, EOG\nPodcast@Zacks.com\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\nIn April 2025, after the Liberation Day tariffs were put into place by the United States, crude oil plunged. WTI traded down to $56 a barrel and has been gyrating between $55 and $65 ever since.\nWhile lower oil prices can mean good news for consumers at the pump, it’s bad news for the energy producers who are unhedged and have certain breakeven levels.\nThe oil and natural gas stocks have gotten hammered due to falling commodity prices and the uncertainty from the tariff turbulence of 2025. Although oil escaped direct American tariffs.\nEnergy companies are lumped into different categories within the oil industry. In this podcast, Tracey talks about “Big Oil” which are the large, integrated oil companies and the American explorers and producers, or the “E & Ps.”\nThe Integrated Oil stocks, as an industry, are down just 3.9% year-to-date. But the American E&Ps, as an industry, are now down 27.8% on the year.\nThe E&Ps, which do not have refining, chemicals, or other divisions to offset their production, are much more volatile when oil sells off.\nJust because a stock sells-off and now has a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, doesn’t mean that it’s a true value in the classical sense of the word.\nRemember, a true value stock is cheap on a P/E basis, but also has rising earning estimates.\nAre the energy stocks cheap, or just traps?\nExxon Mobil is a large American integrated oil company. Shares of Exxon are down 7.1% year-to-date but have finally started sinking in the last month, falling 10.6% in that time.\nExxon appears cheap with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.1. The 2025 Zacks Consensus Estimate is looking for $7.13 but that’s 8.5% under the $7.79 Exxon made last year. One earnings estimate has been revised higher for 2025 and 2 lower in the last week.\nExxon is a dividend all-star, with its dividend currently yielding 3.9%.\nIs Exxon Mobil a value or a trap in 2025?\nChevron is also a large, American integrated oil company. Shares of Chevron are down 6.8% year-to-date but have been hit harder over the last month than Exxon. It’s down 14.3% during that time. But there have been dramatic one-day swings the last week.\nChevron is cheap. It has a forward P/E of 13.3. The Zacks Consensus is looking for $10.30 in 2025, which is earnings growth of 2.5% as it made $10.05 in 2024.\nChevron also pays an attractive dividend, yielding 4.8%.\nIs Chevron a value after the sell-off or a trap?\nEOG Resources is a large cap American exploration and production company. It produces in key basins including the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, and Dorado Play. EOG Resources has a strategy of returning at a minimum of 70% of annual free cash flow to shareholders.\nShares of EOG Resources have fallen 14.7% year-to-date but have really taken it on the chin in the last month, declining 16.9%. It’s cheap, with a forward P/E of 9.5. A P/E under 10 is usually considered a dirt-cheap stock.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is looking for $11.09. EOG Resources made $11.62 last year so that is a decline of 4.6%.\nEOG Resources is currently paying a dividend yielding 3.5%.\nIs EOG Resources a value or a trap in 2025?\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best dividend-paying stocks.\nDividend-paying stocks have consistently attracted investor interest due to their long-term value. CNBC highlights this by examining the historical performance of the broader market. Between 1960 and 2024, a $10,000 investment in the index would have grown to over $982,000 purely from stock price appreciation, based on data from FactSet and NYU Stern. However, many companies in the index also returned capital to shareholders through dividends. Had an investor reinvested those dividends over the years, the investment would have ballooned to approximately $6.42 million by the beginning of 2025.\nThis outlook seems reasonable, especially when considering how crucial cash flow has become in today’s economic environment. Investors continue to favor income-generating assets, and dividends remain one of the most reliable ways to deliver that income. Reflecting this trend, several companies within the market have recently introduced dividend payments.\nAccording to S&P Global, companies in the S&P index now contribute roughly 85% of the total dividends paid across the market—up from 82% in 2024. This increase includes 2.7% of the total dividend pool coming from firms that only recently began issuing dividends. The top 29 companies in the index alone are responsible for 40% of all dividends paid by the index’s constituents and 35% of the total dividends across the entire US equity market. Under the current base-case forecast, these leading firms are expected to distribute a combined $280 billion in dividends. In a more optimistic (upside) scenario, that figure could climb by 2.75% to $288 billion, with major large cap companies projected to deliver the most significant gains by weighted average. If the most favorable (bull-case) conditions materialize, these 29 companies could boost total dividend payouts by an estimated 4.5%, contributing an additional 1% themselves.\nIt’s no surprise, then, that dividends have become a central theme in many investors’ strategies. According to Brian Bollinger, founder of Simply Safe Dividends, focusing on companies that regularly pay dividends can offer a sense of reassurance. He further noted that younger investors, in particular, have the opportunity to build long-term dividend growth portfolios aimed at maximizing total return and capital appreciation over time.\nAccording to Nuveen, companies that focus on dividend growth tend to possess strong long-term fundamentals and may deliver relatively attractive performance in the year ahead. Historically, firms that consistently increased or initiated dividend payments have produced higher annualized returns and exhibited lower volatility compared to the broader equity market. While such companies may not lead in every market environment, their favorable risk-adjusted returns over extended periods make them a solid foundation for equity portfolios.\nNuveen also suggested that many firms remain in a strong position to continue raising dividends over time. In the US, corporate balance sheets are generally healthy, consumer spending remains steady, and earnings growth is projected to pick up pace in 2025. Data from FactSet shows that dividends per share for the S&P index rose by 7.6% in 2024, with consensus forecasts pointing to a further 4.2% increase in 2025. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\nOur Methodology:\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of the close of Q4 2024. From the top 60 companies, we selected 11 dividend stocks with yields of at least 1% as of April 12. These companies show strong financial performance and have solid records of paying dividends. The stocks are ranked according to the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\nAn American multinational oil and gas company, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is a global leader in integrated energy and chemical operations, ranks at the top of the best oil and gas dividend stocks to consider. In Q4 2024, the company reported a revenue of $83.4 billion, reflecting a slight 1.1% dip from the previous year. Despite this, its long-term performance remained steady, supported by $12.1 billion in structural cost savings since 2019. These efforts have helped offset inflation and expansion costs while enabling it to outperform industry peers. For 2024, the company recorded a sector-leading return on capital employed at 12.7%, with a five-year average of 10.8%.\nWith a strong cash flow position, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands out as a reliable dividend payer. It generated $55 billion in operating cash flow during 2024, marking its third-strongest year in the past decade. For Q4 alone, operating cash flow reached $12.2 billion, while free cash flow totaled $8 billion. The company returned $36 billion to shareholders in 2024, including $16.7 billion in dividend payments.\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) boasts a rich dividend legacy, having paid shareholders for 143 consecutive years and growing its dividend consistently for the past 42 years. Currently, it pays a quarterly dividend of $0.99 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.84%, as of April 12.\nOverall, XOM ranks 6th on our list of the best dividend paying stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best bargain stocks to buy in May.\nWhile increasing tariffs and a hard sell-off have resulted in uncertainty, Neuberger Berman, an investment manager, expects that negotiations can bring some relief to initial tariff proposals. Furthermore, the firm anticipates a sharply slower growth than a US recession. Also, it believes that stimulus in Europe and China can rejuvenate global industrial activity, and the firm recommends styles, sectors, and regions that are most geared to it.\nGiven that a significant amount of tariff shock has now been priced in, Neuberger Berman is constructive on global equities for the remainder of the year. The firm expects that an ongoing recovery in the global industrial economy might be dampened but not derailed. The underlying momentum in the goods economy is expected to support equities that are most levered to it. Furthermore, the firm prefers value over growth (which is relatively expensive) and small caps over large caps. While an overdose of growth-inhibiting policy can impact the relatively healthy economy and push it into recession, the investment management firm believes that the US hasn’t yet reached that point. As per the firm, performance during the decline demonstrates relative strength in some of the more cyclical economic sectors in the US and around the world. The goods-oriented sectors, regions, and styles continue to outperform amidst the recent sell-off.\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\nS&P Global expects inflation to remain closer to 3.0% in 2025 as tariffs raise the prices along the domestic supply chain as well as for the end consumers. For 2026, the firm expects growth to pick up after a slow start. This is because of the abatement of uncertainty associated with the structure of tariffs and the further easing of the policy rate by the Federal Reserve. Also, the growth is expected to be aided partly because of a more favorable growth backdrop in the eurozone, which can help expand US exports.\nNeuberger Berman opines that a combination of improving fundamentals and stabilizing risks increased the optimism in the energy sector. As per the firm, increased global industrial activity is expected to continue to buoy oil demand and keep prices aloft. Furthermore, energy seems to be the most undervalued sector in the S&P 500 relative to the current and expected earnings growth. The investment management firm believes that much of the negative news, including regulatory concerns and geopolitical risks, seem to be factored in. This suggests that energy stocks can increase as the sentiment improves.\nTo list the 10 Best Bargain Stocks to Buy in May, we used a screener to shortlist the companies that trade at a forward P/E of less than ~20.0x. Next, we chose the ones that analysts see upside to, as of April 11. We also mentioned hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q4 2024. Finally, the stocks were arranged in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\nForward P/E as of April 11: ~13.4x\nAverage Upside Potential: ~22.1%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is engaged in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. Jason Gabelman, an analyst from TD Cowen, remains optimistic about the company’s stock, given its focus on maintaining a reasonable near-term valuation. This, together with the clear pathway to FCF growth, continues to support the analyst’s optimism. Furthermore, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)’s strategic efforts in upgrading the portfolio while, at the same time, managing its capital expenditures effectively with the help of technology-driven efficiencies and a healthy project organization cement its financial health. Given the structural cost reductions achieved over the past few years and a commitment to value creation, the company exhibits potential for sustainable growth, says the analyst.\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)’s expansion into the low-carbon power sector offers strong growth potential. With the global energy markets pivoting towards cleaner sources, its investments in this area can place it well as a leader in the energy transition. Furthermore, the diversification can result in the opening up of new revenue streams, which can attract environmentally-conscious investors and can potentially offset the risks related to the future regulations on fossil fuels. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) remains focused on positioning itself for future growth via strategic initiatives. It is expected to leverage synergies from its Pioneer Natural Resources acquisition.\nOverall, XOM ranks 9th on our list of best bargain stocks to buy in May. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nLast week's rally in the broader stock market indexes sprung the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -3.07%) back upward after a more than 20% that technically put it into a bear market. However, it's apparent that market volatility may be far from over.\nIncome investors looking at the current landscape may be wondering if now is the best time to buy dividend stocks given the wild swings to the upside and the downside. Here are some risks worth considering before buying dividend stocks and why ExxonMobil (XOM 1.04%) is a good example of a dividend stock that you can buy with confidence during a bear market.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nInvestors who use dividends for financial planning or to supplement income in retirement will want to target companies with reliable payouts. After all, what good is a dividend if a company cuts it at the slightest sign of economic uncertainty?\nExxonMobil has raised its dividend for 42 consecutive years -- which may come as a surprise given the ups and downs in the oil and gas industry. In the last decade alone, there was the crash of 2014 and 2015 and the plunge during the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, ExxonMobil reported its worst year on record in 2020 -- a staggering $22.4 billion loss.\nEven during a period of high uncertainty and a collapse in the global economy, ExxonMobil kept its dividend streak alive in 2020 because it relied on the strength of its balance sheet.\nExxonMobil's balance sheet is in its best shape in over a decade.\nExxonMobil's net total long-term debt position is just $14.7 billion, which is small for a company of its size. Its financial debt-to-equity ratio of 0.08 and debt-to-capital ratio of 12.5% showcase how the company has reduced its dependence on debt and can rely on free cash flow to fund operating expenses and long-term investments.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nIn fact, ExxonMobil has the lowest debt-to-capital ratio of the major integrated U.S. and European oil and gas companies -- a close second being its U.S. peer Chevron.\n\nBP Debt To Capital (Quarterly) data by YCharts\nExxonMobil can support its dividend even if margins fall due to lower oil and gas prices. The company has considerably improved its cost structure and technological advancements that have reduced production costs.\nExxonMobil has a long-term plan through 2030 built around Brent (the international benchmark) crude oil prices averaging $65 per barrel. However, it also has an optimistic scenario at $85 Brent and a pessimistic outcome at $55 per barrel. Even at $55 per barrel, ExxonMobil expects to earn a cash surplus of $110 billion from 2025 to 2030 thanks to higher free cash flow from its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, development of onshore assets in the Permian Basin, production expansion offshore Guyana, and other moves.\nBrent crude oil prices averaged $81 per barrel in 2024 but have fallen in recent weeks due to tariff tensions, production increases in the Middle East, and recession fears. Brent crude oil is at a three-year low of around $63.60 at the time of this writing. But again, even at this level, the dividend is manageable -- although ExxonMobil may pull back on near-term capital expenditures if prices stay low.\nThe third risk worth considering before scooping up shares of dividend stocks during a bear market is whether the company can endure a prolonged slowdown. Or, in this case, tariffs.\nDividend affordability and a strong balance sheet are part of the equation, but so are competitive advantages. ExxonMobil can profit from its oil and gas production portfolio even at lower prices. Unlike some pure-play companies, ExxonMobil isn't dependent on a single geographic region. ExxonMobil also has a massive refining business and a growing low-carbon division. So, in the event of a slowdown, the company should be well positioned to take market share or even pounce on an acquisition opportunity.\nNot all dividend-paying companies have ExxonMobil's advantages. Some companies had strained balance sheets heading into 2025. Others have a dividend expense that is already eating up the bulk of profits. So, for these companies, if profits come down and stay down for too long, there could be pressure for a dividend cut.\nDividends are an excellent way to collect passive income no matter what stock prices are doing -- allowing investors to book a return without having to sell stock. But a dividend is only as reliable as the company paying it.\nDespite operating in the cyclical oil and gas industry, ExxonMobil is a beacon of dividend reliability. With a yield of 4%, ExxonMobil is an excellent way to generate a sizable amount of passive income while staying invested in the market.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in ExxonMobil, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ExxonMobil wasn’t one of them.

Goldman Sachs has hiked its recession probability a few times in recent weeks, bumping it from 20% all the way to 45%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan is even more bearish. Its recession model sees a nearly 80% chance the economy goes into a recession, up from 60% not long ago. \nRecessions tend to cause corporate profits to decline, which drives many companies to cut costs through layoffs and other initiatives. Some companies will even cut or suspend their dividend payments to shareholders to conserve cash. \nHowever, other companies are more recession-resistant due to the durability of their cash flows and the strength of their balance sheets. ExxonMobil (XOM 1.04%) and Coca-Cola (KO -0.19%) have proven their ability to weather recessions over the decades. They've both increased their dividends throughout at least the past four recessions. There's a good chance they can withstand the next one with similar ease. \n\nXOM Dividend data by YCharts. Gray bars are recessions.\nExxonMobil hiked its dividend payment by 4% earlier this year, extending its streak to 42 years of annual payment increases. \"We're proud of the fact that we've increased our annual dividend per share for 42 years in a row, something only 4% of S&P 500 companies can claim,\" stated CFO Kathy Mikells during the oil giant's fourth-quarter earnings conference call. She continued, \"And we plan for that track record to continue for decades to come, which is only possible by investing in the high-quality growth opportunities that drive leading returns and higher cash flows.\" \nThe energy company has been investing heavily in transforming its business to dramatically improve its underlying earnings power while also expanding into lower-carbon energy. This strategy has boosted its earnings capacity by nearly $14 billion over the past five years on a constant price and margin basis. Exxon plans to invest over $140 billion into major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program through 2030, which, along with structural cost savings, should add another $20 billion to its annual earnings capacity. \nThat incremental income will give Exxon even more fuel to grow its dividend, which is already on an incredibly safe foundation. Last year, Exxon produced $34.4 billion in free cash flow, easily covering its $16.7 billion dividend outlay. Meanwhile, it has a fortress balance sheet with an ultra-low 6% leverage ratio and a massive $23.2 billion cash balance. These factors put the oil giant's 3.8%-yielding dividend on a rock-solid foundation that should continue withstanding recessions. \nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nCoca-Cola boosted its dividend payment by 5.2% earlier this year. That extended its dividend growth streak to 63 straight years. That raise kept Coca-Cola in the ultra-elite group of Dividend Kings, companies with 50 or more years of annual dividend increases. \nThe company has benefited from the durable and growing demand for its beverage brands. Its portfolio features multiple billion-dollar brands that generate lots of free cash flow for the company. Coca-Cola expects to produce $9.5 billion in free cash flow this year, more than enough to cover its dividend outlay ($8.4 billion last year). The company also has a strong cash-rich balance sheet ($12.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments) with leverage at the low end of its target range. \nCoca-Cola's long-term target is to organically grow its revenue by 4%-6% annually, which should drive mid-to-high single-digit earnings-per-share growth. Meanwhile, the company can enhance its growth rate by making accretive acquisitions. That puts it in a strong position to continue increasing its 2.9%-yielding dividend. \nExxon and Coca-Cola have increased their dividends every year for several decades, which includes the last four recessions. They're in excellent positions to continue raising their payout during the next downturn, whether that happens later this year or further in the future. Because of that, they're great dividend stocks to buy for a durable passive income stream. \n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in ExxonMobil, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ExxonMobil wasn’t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other undervalued energy stocks.\nOn March 18, Tortoise Capital senior portfolio manager Rob Thummel appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ to discuss his outlook on the energy sector. He believes that natural gas is positioned to lead growth in the future within the energy sector. This natural gas demand is driven by electricity and energy exports. Thummel noted that the energy and tech sectors are converging due to advancements like AI and data centers. Electricity demand fuels natural gas consumption, while US energy exports help meet global needs for low-cost and low-carbon energy. He also highlighted that the US is now emerging as the largest exporter of LNG, even though it was an LNG importer just years ago. He anticipates that the US LNG exports will soon 2x in volume over time. Thummel also expects Europe and other countries to prioritize energy security and diversify their supply sources. This will ensure reliance on US energy exports.\nThummel emphasized a focus on energy infrastructure companies while discussing his specific investment strategies as they tend to be stable and have high dividend yields even in uncertain market conditions. He thinks that the certainty provided by energy infrastructure investments in an otherwise volatile market should not be neglected. Such companies generate substantial annual cash flows while maintaining disciplined financial practices.\nThummel thinks that the energy sector trades at a discount to historical valuations despite its fundamentals. This offers the potential for high returns.\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top energy stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15 as of April 10. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\nForward P/E Ratio as of April 10: 13.77\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) manufactures, trades, transports, and sells crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals, and other specialty products. It’s also pursuing lower-emission and other business opportunities, such as carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, lower-emission fuels, Proxxima systems, carbon materials, and lithium.\nThe acquisition of Pioneer assets has strengthened the company’s position in the Permian basin. In 2024, the company achieved record production from both its Heritage ExxonMobil assets and the newly acquired Pioneer assets. The combined strength of these assets is projected to yield an average of more than $3 billion per year in synergies. Production is expected to increase from 1.5 million oil-equivalent barrels per day at the end of 2024 to 2.3 million barrels per day by 2030. This represents ~50% growth.\nThe Permian Basin is a key contributor to Exxon Mobil Corp.’s (NYSE:XOM) overall upstream portfolio, which achieved the highest-ever production from its advantaged assets and the highest liquid production from its overall portfolio in more than 40 years. The company’s focus on low-cost supply, low emissions intensity, and high returns in the Permian ensures that this segment will continue to drive growth.\nOverall, XOM ranks 1st on our list of the best undervalued energy stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of XOM, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

In the meantime, Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM has already offered an early glimpse of how the quarter might have shaped up. As oil and natural gas prices were buoyant in the March quarter, we expect BP plc BP and SLB SLB to beat on first-quarter earnings.\nPer the data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), the average Cushing, OK WTI spot prices for January, February, and March of this year were $75.74, $71.53 and $68.24 per barrel, respectively. Thus, the overall pricing environment was favorable in the first quarter of 2025, as the breakeven costs of the exploration and production companies in the shale plays are significantly lower.\nHowever, although crude prices were advantageous in the March quarter of this year, the overall prices of the commodity were a bit higher at $74.15, $77.25 and $81.28 per barrel in January, February and March of 2024, respectively. Hence, the oil-energy sector is likely to have generated lower total earnings in the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the prior-year quarter.\nOur data suggests that in the March quarter of 2025, the sector will probably generate total earnings of $27.5 billion, lower than $30.5 billion in the first quarter of 2024.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNotably, the pricing scenario for natural gas was not only healthier but also favorable in the first quarter of 2025.\nSince the prices of both crude oil and natural gas were favorable for exploration and production activities, upstream energy players will likely report handsome first-quarter results. Oilfield service players will also likely remain in the sweet spot since they help upstream firms set up oil and gas wells effectively.  \nXOM, one of the largest integrated energy players, recently reported in an SEC filing that it expects its upstream earnings for the March quarter to increase sequentially by as much as $800 million. The company attributed advantageous oil and gas prices for the improvement. Moreover, ExxonMobil expects its Energy Products business unit to witness a sequential improvement of $300-$700 million owing to the changes in industry margins.\nWith the existence of a number of players in the sector, finding the right energy stocks that have the potential to beat on earnings can be daunting. Our proprietary methodology, however, makes it fairly simple.\nYou could narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), and a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nSLB\nSLB is a leading oilfield service player. As exploration and production activities were favorable, SLB is likely to have witnessed increased demand for its well construction, completions and reservoir characterization activities.\nSLB currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and a Zacks Rank of 3. It is slated to report first-quarter 2025 results on April 25.\nThe company's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 1.78%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBP\nBP, a British energy giant, currently has an Earnings ESP of +9.14% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. Supportive commodity prices are likely to have aided BP. The company is slated to report first-quarter 2025 results on April 29.\nHowever, BP expects its production from upstream operations to be lower sequentially. BP’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters and missed in the other two, delivering an average negative surprise of 3.04%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Earlier, XOM had mentioned that it collected extensive three-dimensional (3D) seismic data and discovered several large prospects offshore Cyprus, including the Electra prospect. Based on the evaluation of the seismic data, the company stated that the Electra prospect was promising.\nThe U.S. energy major recently completed drilling activities at the Elektra-1 well. The Ministry of Energy, Commerce and Industry in Cyprus noted that preliminary assessments and the data collected from the exploratory well indicated that the gas reserves at the prospect were commercially infeasible for development. However, the ministry also noted that XOM’s initial assessments, following the drilling operations, have shown promising results. The initial results of the evaluation confirm the presence of a hydrocarbon system alongside high-quality reservoirs.\nThe drilling operations at the Electra prospect were conducted by a consortium comprising ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Cyprus, and QatarEnergy International E&P LLC, with the former acting as the operator. The Elektra-1 well was drilled in Block 5 of the Exclusive Economic Zone (“EEZ”) in Cyprus. ExxonMobil holds exploration licenses in two offshore blocks in Cyprus, with QatarEnergy as its partner.\nThe country's energy ministry has stated that the information collected while conducting drilling operations will be analyzed further and considered by the consortium before determining its future plans in Block 5. The consortium will now focus on drilling another exploratory well, Pegasus-1, located in a different offshore block in Cyrus’ EEZ.\nThe results pose a major setback for Cyprus as the country is yet to produce natural gas from its offshore discoveries. Cyprus is trying to secure its position as an alternative natural gas supplier to the European Union (EU). After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, many European nations are trying to diversify their gas supply sources, and the Mediterranean region has attracted significant attention due to its offshore gas reserves. However, the initial assessment of the Elektra-1 well has dealt a blow to Cyprus’ ambitions to establish itself as an alternative supplier and contribute to the EU’s energy security.\nXOM currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\nSome better-ranked stocks from the energy sector are Archrock Inc. AROC, Nine Energy Service NINE and Kinder Morgan, Inc. KMI. While Archrock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Nine Energy Service and Kinder Morgan carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nArchrock is an energy infrastructure company based in the United States with a focus on midstream natural gas compression. It provides natural gas contract compression services and generates stable fee-based revenues. With natural gas playing an increasingly important role in the energy transition journey, AROC is expected to witness sustained demand for its services.\nNine Energy Service provides onshore completion and production services for unconventional oil and gas resource development. It operates across key prolific basins in the United States, including the Permian, Eagle Ford, MidCon, Barnett, Bakken, Rockies, Marcellus and Utica, as well as throughout Canada. With a sustained demand for oil and gas in the future, the need for NINE’s services is anticipated to increase, which should position the company for growth in the long run.\nKinder Morgan is a leading North American midstream player with a stable and resilient business model, largely driven by take-or-pay contracts. KMI’s stable business model shields it from commodity price volatility, resulting in predictable earnings and facilitating reliable capital returns to its shareholders.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best oil stocks.\nAfter an encouraging start to the year, the energy sector is once again lagging behind the overall market. At the time of writing this piece, the broader energy sector has slid by almost 8.2% since the beginning of 2025, against declines of around 7.9% by the wider market. The principal reason behind this fall is the decline in the global prices of oil, which have plunged by almost 14.5% since the beginning of the year.\nREAD NEXT: 10 Best Clean Energy Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires\nThe continued uncertainty surrounding the ongoing tariff war and the recent decision by OPEC+ to increase supply in May have taken a toll on the global price, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price now hovering around a 3-year low of $61.5. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecasted WTI price to average $63.88 per barrel for 2025 before dropping to an average of $57.48 next year. Such a sharp decline in prices could threaten US oil production growth this year. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the US oil industry needs prices between $61 and $70 per barrel to be profitable.\nThe escalating trade tensions between the US and China have also raised the prospect of a global economic slowdown, potentially leading to a lower-than-forecasted consumption of oil. In its latest report, the EIA now expects global oil consumption to increase by 900,000 b/d in 2025 and 1 million b/d in 2026, down by 400,000 b/d and 100,000 b/d, respectively, from its initial forecast last month. The decrease in demand, coupled with increasing production, will continue putting pressure on crude prices, forcing many industry players to cut back activity to maintain investor payouts.\nThe American oil and gas sector is also frustrated by the back and forth trade policies of President Trump and is questioning how they align with his ‘drill, baby, drill’ mandate to further boost production. According to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, nearly a third of oil executives have stated that their business outlook has worsened since the end of 2024. Moreover, the imposition of the 25% tariff on steel and aluminum has already led to an estimated 4% increase in costs for drilling a well.\nThe pressing issues surrounding the global oil trade have forced the industry to shift focus to its second major source of revenue – natural gas. In contrast to oil, the benchmark US natural gas price at Henry Hub has surged by more than 123% since last year and by almost 18% since the beginning of 2025. The uptick comes as a result of slowing output in 2024, booming LNG exports, and fast-depleting inventories during the coldest winter in six years. Moreover, natural gas has emerged as a leading candidate to power the ongoing AI boom and its accompanying data centers, with many providers now even aiming to surpass utilities and supply directly to these power-hungry facilities.\nAlso, despite the broad concerns, many billionaires continue to invest and remain bullish on the oil sector. A great example is how Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway maintains significant holdings in multiple oil majors and even recently invested hundreds of millions of dollars in an oil and gas giant over the last few months.\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\nTo collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of billionaires’ stock holdings and picked the top 10 companies operating in the oil sector with the highest number of billionaire investors in the Insider Monkey database in Q4 of 2024. When two or more companies had the same number of billionaires backing them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year. Following are the Best Oil Stocks According to Billionaires.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Billionaire Holders: 16\nTopping our list of the Best Oil Stocks According to Billionaires is Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), one of the largest integrated fuels, lubricants, and chemical companies in the world. The company operates facilities or markets products around the globe and explores for oil and natural gas on six continents.\nAfter the $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources last year, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)’s production in the Permian Basin and Guyana hit a record high in 2024. The oil major delivered an industry-leading financial performance last year, with $34 billion in earnings and $55 billion in cash flow from operations, its third-highest result in a decade despite softer market conditions. The company’s total production came in at 4.3 million boed in 2024, with a target to achieve close to 5.4 million boed in 2030.\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has grown its earnings at an annual rate of roughly 30% over the last five years, while its cash flow has increased at a CAGR of about 15%. The company intends to continue this momentum and expects to add a further $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in cash flow by the end of the decade. Exxon remains committed to its shareholders, having grown its annual dividend for 42 consecutive years. The company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.99 per share for Q1 of 2025 and also revealed plans to repurchase $20 billion in shares annually through 2026.\nOverall, XOM ranks 1st on our list of the best oil stocks to invest in according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM to grow , our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on — Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, BP plc (BP) and SLB SLB.\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\nZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock StoneCo is a leading fintech company based in Brazil. The company runs a complete end-to-end cloud-based platform that allows retailers and businesses to accept electronic payments across storefronts and mobile and online channels. Investors can breakdown StoneCo’s business into three primary segments, including:\n1. Payment Processing: STNE is the leading provider of point-of-sale payment processing services. Like Block(formerly Square) in the United States, STNE’s technology empowers businesses to accept credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallet payments through its point-of-sale payment solution.\n2. Banking Services: StoneCo is much more than a payment processor. Small and medium-sized businesses can use STNE to bank, pay bills, and manage accounts. In addition, because STNE collects transaction data, the company can utilize that data to assess a client’s creditworthiness and offer loans.\n3. Software Tools: Like Canadian e-commerce leader Shopify (SHOP), STNE offers a full suite of products that allow businesses to seamlessly conduct e-commerce transactions, analyze their client base, and manage customers.\nStone allows investors to harness the growth of a largely untapped and rapidly growing Brazilian payments market. Brazil is the world’s ninth-largest economy and boasts the largest economy in Latin America, with more than $2 trillion in annual GDP. In Brazil, retail sales are growing, the middle class encompasses roughly 60% of the population, and the country is modernizing into a digital economy.\nUnlike the United States, Brazil’s digital payment economy is unsaturated, with roughly only 15% of consumers using digital payments currently. However, Statista predicts that, from 2025 to 2029, the Brazilian digital payment market will register a ~29% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and grow from ~$300 billion to ~$900 billion.\nStoneCO has consistently delivered EPS results above Wall Street expectations. The company has outpaced Zacks Consensus Estimates in twelve of the past thirteen quarters. Last quarter, despite a difficult and uncertain macroeconomic environment, STNE beat Wall Street’s top-and-bottom-line expectations. A positive EPS surprise of 21.88% last quarter suggests that STNE’s business is gaining momentum.\nDespite a more than 15% earnings surge, STNE shares are cheap and trade at a forward P/E ratio of ~8x EPS.\nSTNE’s technical picture echoes its bullish fundamentals. Following last quarter’s earnings results, shares bolted above the 200-day moving average and are breaking out of a multi-week base structure.\nStoneCo’s comprehensive fintech platform, consistent earnings outperformance, and attractive valuation allow investors to profit from Brazil’s digital payment transformation.\nZacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock RH, formerly Restoration Hardware, is a high-end home furnishings company based in California. RH is a staple in many malls and shopping centers across the United States and offers a plethora of upscale home goods via its 70 galleries, outlets, catalogs, and websites.\nSelling products through its sizable galleries, RH’s product line includes home décor, furniture (including outdoor), bathroom products and bathware, and lighting. While RH’s primary focus is upscale interior products, the company expanded into the hospitality business in 2015, offering a handful of RH branded cafés restaurants, and hotels. RH’s core business is in the US, though it has expanded to Europe and Canada.\nThe story of Wall Street and the 2025 market thus far is the Trump Administration’s aggressive tariff policy aimed at bringing manufacturing back to the United States, improving trade imbalances, and seeking to achieve better trade deals with other countries. Unfortunately, as of 2024, RH sources ~72% of its products from Asia (including 35% from Vietnam, 23% from China, and the rest from Indonesia and India).\nRH addressed supply chain issues earlier this month, saying, “The company has been operating with 25% tariffs from China since the last Trump administration and has successfully resourced the majority of its China production to Vietnam at significantly better than pre-tariff landed China pricing. In addition, the company has successfully resourced a meaningful amount of its China production to its own factory in North Carolina.”\nWhile it’s encouraging to see the company adapt, investor concerns remain. RH is still reliant on China, and moving its supply chain to Vietnam will take time and money. In addition, there is little clarity on trade deals with Indonesia and India at the time of this writing.\nThough RH margins are being squeezed due to tariffs, that is not the only concern the company faces. Consumer confidence has been falling recently and RH’s deep-pocketed customer base may temper spending as it waits for a clearer macroeconomic picture to emerge. Gross margins have sunk from more than 50% to 44.8% since 2022.\nMaintaining luxury showrooms, paying rent, and upending its supply chain have led to rampant spending of more than $1 billion last year. To make matters worse, the company’s debt is soaring and there is no end to the spending in sight.\nRH’s earnings trajectory is moving in the wrong direction for bulls, missing Zacks Consensus Estimates by an average of 103.49% over the past four quarters.\nRH shares plunged more than 40% as volume swelled to more than 10x the norm following the company’s latest earnings announcement. Such ugly price and volume action are symbolic of heavy distribution. In addition, RH is carving out a bearish flag pattern.\nLuxury home furnishing retailer RH faces several bearish headwinds, including tariff policy, ballooning debt, and margin pressures. A worst-possible Zacks Rank and a bearish chart pattern add to the concern.\nWe are yet to get first-quarter 2025 results from the energy companies, with the oil-energy sector’s earnings season to start this week. In the meantime, Exxon Mobil Corp. has already offered an early glimpse of how the quarter might have shaped up. As oil and natural gas prices were buoyant in the March quarter, we expect BP plc and SLB to beat on first-quarter earnings.\nPer the data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), the average Cushing, OK WTI spot prices for January, February, and March of this year were $75.74, $71.53 and $68.24 per barrel, respectively. Thus, the overall pricing environment was favorable in the first quarter of 2025, as the breakeven costs of the exploration and production companies in the shale plays are significantly lower.\nHowever, although crude prices were advantageous in the March quarter of this year, the overall prices of the commodity were a bit higher at $74.15, $77.25 and $81.28 per barrel in January, February and March of 2024, respectively. Hence, the oil-energy sector is likely to have generated lower total earnings in the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the prior-year quarter.\nOur data suggests that in the March quarter of 2025, the sector will probably generate total earnings of $27.5 billion, lower than $30.5 billion in the first quarter of 2024.\nNotably, the pricing scenario for natural gas was not only healthier but also favorable in the first quarter of 2025.\nSince the prices of both crude oil and natural gas were favorable for exploration and production activities, upstream energy players will likely report handsome first-quarter results. Oilfield service players will also likely remain in the sweet spot since they help upstream firms set up oil and gas wells effectively.\nXOM, one of the largest integrated energy players, recently reported in an SEC filing that it expects its upstream earnings for the March quarter to increase sequentially by as much as $800 million. The company attributed advantageous oil and gas prices for the improvement. Moreover, ExxonMobil expects its Energy Products business unit to witness a sequential improvement of $300-$700 million owing to the changes in industry margins.\nWith the existence of a number of players in the sector, finding the right energy stocks that have the potential to beat on earnings can be daunting. Our proprietary methodology, however, makes it fairly simple.\nYou could narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), and a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nSLB is a leading oilfield service player. As exploration and production activities were favorable, SLB is likely to have witnessed increased demand for its well construction, completions and reservoir characterization activities.\nSLB currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and a Zacks Rank of 3. It is slated to report first-quarter 2025 results on April 25.\nThe company's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 1.78%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)\nBP, a British energy giant, currently has an Earnings ESP of +9.14% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. Supportive commodity prices are likely to have aided BP. The company is slated to report first-quarter 2025 results on April 29.\nHowever, BP expects its production from upstream operations to be lower sequentially. BP’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters and missed in the other two, delivering an average negative surprise of 3.04%.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

The blocks across five sedimentary basins, including the deepwater Potiguar and Foz do Amazonas, located near the equator, will also be offered, which are considered to hold Brazil’s greatest potential for replenishing reserves and are projected to start declining by 2030.\nOut of the 172 oil blocks, 47 are at the Foz do Amazonas, where Petrobras, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold),won the exploration deal in 2023 and since then, has been awaiting environmental clearance to drill its first well. These oil blocks are expected to contain the same potential as those in Suriname and Guyana, where Exxon Mobil found billions of barrels of oil. The delay in environmental clearance certainly reduces the attractiveness of these blocks for the auction.\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nCertain environmental working groups have suggested dropping some Potiguar Basin oil blocks, like Atol das Rocas and the Fernando de Noronha archipelago as they are in places of extreme environmental sensitivity and ecosystem connectivity.\nHowever, Brazil’s several ministries jointly allowed these sensitive areas to be offered for auction, even though this authorization expires just a day after the auction. This puts the Potiguar Basin at particular risk of exclusion from future rounds.\nDespite the controversies, the auction has attracted interest from the industry’s big players. Thirty-one companies have registered themselves to bid for the upcoming auction, including Petrobras, Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM, Chevron Corporation CVX, BP p.l.c. BP,Shell and Equinor.\nExxon Mobil is a U.S.-based oil and gas giant that has a track record of optimal capital structure and Capex discipline across the commodity price cycle, making it a low-risk energy player producing industry-leading returns. XOM’s expected growth rate for earnings per share for the next year is 21.88%, which aligns favorably with the industry growth rate of 16.30%.\nHouston, TX-based Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companiesthat participates in every aspect related to energy,from oil production to refining and marketing. CVX generates more than $200 billion in annual revenues and produces over three million barrels per day of oil equivalent. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVX’s 2025 earnings indicates 2.49% year-over-year growth.\nBP, an integrated oil and gas company, is driven by its strategic shift toward traditional and renewable energy. BP plans to reduce debt and strengthen its balance sheet while prioritizing shareholder returns by generating proceeds from asset sales.

This initiative, confirmed by Guyana’s maritime authority earlier this week, marks a significant step toward the rapid development of the country’s prolific Stabroek Block.\nBuilt by SBM Offshore, the One Guyana FPSO has a production capacity of 250,000 barrels per day. It departed Singapore in mid-February and reached Guyanese waters this week. Once operational, the vessel is expected to help push the consortium’s total production capacity to around 940,000 barrels per day by the end of 2025.\nThe FPSO will support the development of ExxonMobil's Yellowtail and Redtail fields, both located within the giant Stabroek Block. With over 11 billion barrels of recoverable resources discovered, the block has become one of the most significant offshore oil finds in recent history.\nAfter recent upgrades, the company produced an average of 616,000 barrels per day from its three operational FPSOs in 2024. The addition of One Guyana marks a significant step toward boosting that number.\nExxonMobil confirmed the vessel's arrival in a recent statement, noting that production from the Yellowtail project is expected to commence later this year, once installation and well work are complete. According to shipping data, One Guyana is currently positioned near Exxon’s three active FPSOs in Guyanese waters.\nWith two more FPSOs scheduled to arrive over the next two years, ExxonMobil is signaling continued confidence in Guyana's role as a key pillar of its upstream growth strategy. The rapid deployment of infrastructure and consistent production ramp-ups suggest that the South American nation is poised to become a major player in global oil markets, with ExxonMobil at the helm.Top of Form\nBottom of Form\nExxonMobil currently carries a Zack Rank #4 (Sell).\nInvestors interested in the energy sector may look at some better-ranked stocks like Archrock Inc.

The Permian Basin has become a linchpin for both as they sharpen their focus on scalable, high-return assets. Each company is doubling down on this prolific region serving as a key source of cash flow, but their paths diverge in strategy and execution.\nAccording to the Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), U.S. crude oil production, largely driven by the Permian, is expected to reach 13.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2025 and 13.6 million bpd in 2026. With Permian output set to grow by 290,000 bpd this year from 2024 and an additional 170,000 bpd in 2026, the region will account for nearly half of the nation’s oil supply, solidifying its role in the energy market. This surge in production is backed by record-breaking rig efficiency, robust infrastructure and continued investments in drilling innovations, ensuring long-term sustainability and profitability for key players in the basin.\nChevron holds 1.78 million net acres in the Delaware and Midland sub-basins of Texas and New Mexico, making it one of the largest leaseholders in the Permian. It boosts efficiency by drilling several horizontal wells from a single site, a method known as factory-style development. In 2024, Chevron’s average daily output from the Permian basin stood at 405,000 barrels of oil, 251,000 barrels of NGLs, and 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas.Chevron aims to reach 1 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (BOE/d) in 2025 and is already close, producing 992,000 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2024. With layered rock formations, upgraded infrastructure, and sustainability steps like using electric fleets and solar energy, Chevron’s strategy focuses on both growth and reducing environmental impact.Meanwhile, ExxonMobil has aggressively ramped up its Permian presence through acquisitions — most notably its $63 billion buyout of Pioneer Natural Resources in 2024. This move expanded Exxon’s footprint to more than 1.3 million net acres and significantly boosted output. In 2024, ExxonMobil’s Permian production averaged 1.185 million BOE/d, up 570,000 from the prior year. The company plans to double that to 2.3 million BOE/d by 2030. To get there, it’s using advanced methods like special proppants and cube drilling, and it aims to cut emissions to net zero in its original Permian operations by 2030 and in Pioneer’s by 2035.\nChevron leans on a disciplined capital allocation model, emphasizing cost control and asset returns. It supplements operated activity with joint ventures and royalty interests to balance risk and capital intensity. In particular, Chevron’s use of royalty interests allows it to benefit from production upside without committing large amounts of capital. On the other hand, ExxonMobil is leaning heavily into scale and integration. ExxonMobil, on the other hand, is integrating scale through acquisitions and focusing on operational synergies. Its Pioneer deal gave it high-quality, contiguous acreage, which is expected to support production growth at lower costs. Both companies are aligning their Permian strategies with broader low-carbon goals but are taking slightly different paths to get there.\nOver the past six months, Chevron has outperformed ExxonMobil despite both stocks being weighed down by trade-related uncertainty and new U.S. tariffs. The market has been jittery amid fears that steep levies could dent global demand.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nChevron’s valuation remains attractive, too. It trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 5.55, which is more favorable compared to ExxonMobil. This suggests better value for investors focused on cash flow and capital discipline.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLooking ahead, Chevron appears better positioned in terms of earnings momentum. The Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for a 2.9% decline in its 2025 EPS, followed by a strong 23.1% rebound in 2026.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn contrast, ExxonMobil is projected to see a steeper 10.5% decline this year, with a 21.1% recovery anticipated in 2026. The near-term outlook for ExxonMobil remains more uncertain, weighed down by integration costs from recent acquisitions and ongoing inflationary pressures. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile both Chevron and ExxonMobil are deeply invested in the Permian Basin and share a commitment to scale and lower emissions, Chevron currently holds the upper hand. It combines consistent execution with financial discipline and a clear path toward its production goals. While CVX holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it stands on firmer ground than XOM, which holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). For now, Chevron looks better placed to navigate market headwinds and deliver stable, long-term shareholder value.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in.\nAs we recently discussed in another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’s Berkshire picks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.\nOverall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio.\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\nTo compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nGoldman Sachs' Q4 2024 Stake Value: $2,504,575,163\nP/E Ratio as of April 11: 12.85\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), an American multinational oil and gas titan, is one of the best Goldman Sachs value stocks. The investment firm holds 6.5 million shares of XOM worth $2.5 billion as of Q4 2024. On April 4, TD Cowen reiterated a Buy rating on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) but trimmed the price target from $128 to $125. While the company’s financial outlook has slightly shifted, analysts at TD Cowen remain confident in Exxon’s performance and share buyback plans, even if commodity prices dip. They still see it as one of the strongest picks in the energy sector.\nIn 2024, ExxonMobil reported $33.7 billion in earnings, slightly less than last year’s $36 billion. The company generated $55 billion in cash from operations and returned $36 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. It also led the industry in shareholder returns over the past 1, 3, and 5 years. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) plans to maintain its $20 billion annual share repurchase program through 2026. XOM raised its dividend for the 42nd straight year and ended 2024 with a $23.2 billion cash balance and low debt levels.\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has remodeled its oil and gas portfolio by discarding assets worth $15 billion and focusing on resources like the Permian Basin, Guyana, and LNG. The company’s full-year production came in at 4.3 million BOED, which can potentially reach 5.4 million BOED by 2030. The Pioneer acquisition boosted its Permian position, and innovation is improving recovery rates. XOM also plans to double its LNG capacity through projects in the United States, Papua New Guinea, and Mozambique.\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 104 hedge funds held long positions in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), compared to 86 funds in the earlier quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management was a significant stakeholder of the company, with 8.6 million shares valued at roughly $934 million.\nOverall, XOM ranks 6th among the Goldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks. While we acknowledge the potential of value stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.
