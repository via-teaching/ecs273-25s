Vienna-based group NOYB, led by activist Max Schrems, had complained to various national privacy watchdogs about Meta’s AI training plans and urged them to stop the company before it started training its next generation of AI models.Meta noted that a panel of EU privacy regulators in December “affirmed” that its original approach met legal obligations.The company said it won't use private messages to train its AI model and repeated its point that it is merely following the example of rivals Google and OpenAI, “both of which have already used data from European users to train their AI models."Meta said it will start notifying users in the EU about the training, and will include a link to a form where they can object at any time.“We'll honor all objection forms,” the company said.Argentina's grain industry welcomed an exchange-rate overhaul on Monday, though the new measures will likely not translate into immediate sales as the harvest remains behind schedule, experts said.  Late on Friday, Argentina's central bank loosened foreign-exchange controls, a long-awaited measure twinned with billions of dollars to be disbursed by development banks including the International Monetary Fund.  Lifting of the controls is also meant to speed up agricultural sales, a prime source of cash from abroad.Goldman expects prices to rebound to $2,300 per metric ton (/t) by December 2025, compared to its earlier forecast of $2,650/t.  London Metals Exchange (LME) aluminium was trading at around $2,392/t as of 1300 GMT on Monday.  U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed or floated plans for a series of global tariffs since his return to office, including 25% tariffs on steel, aluminium and auto parts alongside major tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.META expands its Ray-Ban smart glasses capabilities in the United Kingdom, adding advanced AI features, including object recognition and real-time translation.We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks to Watch Now.
