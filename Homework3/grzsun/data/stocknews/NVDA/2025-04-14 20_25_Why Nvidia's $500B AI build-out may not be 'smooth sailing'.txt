Right? Now they're going to, uh, build chips and AI platforms here in the US. So certainly, uh, tariffs aren't going to be relevant for them once that's up and running in a year. And yet the stock is barely up today, maybe half a percent. Can you help us understand why Nvidia isn't up more?Yeah, I think Nvidia has a lot of other things going as well. There is this suspicion that AI has run its course, uh, things like that. You know, maybe people have already got their chips already. So things like that. Then we had Deepseek, and there's some alternatives to Nvidia. Maybe you can do things cheaper and faster in some other ways. So that that total dominance of Nvidia is being threatened, though I don't believe that. Nvidia is still the major player. Uh, you need them for everything from robotics to cars to everything else. They are the core piece of every all the things that are going on, or that are coming down the pike. So I don't think Nvidia is at risk, but on the face of it, I think there is a risk. There is that feeling that maybe it's not smooth sailing. They're going to have some, they need to do some reinvention and be ahead of the game. So there are some challenges ahead. So they had other issues going as well. Uh, and Nvidia is playing the tariff game pretty well. They're well-positioned. They're already in, uh, in Arizona, and they agree to spend $500 million, which, billion, I think that's that's great as well. So I think they're doing the right things, so I think they're okay. But overall, I think AI, the whole whole setup around AI is kind of not as smooth as it was before.We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Hints at a Bigger Agenda Behind Tariffs and Breaks Down These 7 Stocks.
