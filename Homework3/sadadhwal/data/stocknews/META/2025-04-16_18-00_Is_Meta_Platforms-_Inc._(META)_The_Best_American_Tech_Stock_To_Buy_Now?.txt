In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other American tech stocks.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">American stocks moved up a bit on Monday, April 14 as investors focused on news about tech companies getting a break from President Trump’s tariffs. The S&amp;P 500 rose by 0.8%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose by 0.6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by about 0.7%.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><b>READ ALSO: </b><a class="link" data-rapid_p="13" data-ylk="slk:11 Best American Energy Stocks to Buy Now;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/11-best-american-energy-stocks-to-buy-now-1502647/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><b>11 Best American Energy Stocks to Buy Now</b></a><b> and </b><a class="link" data-rapid_p="14" data-ylk="slk:10 Best Stocks Under $10 to Buy Now;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-best-stocks-under-10-to-buy-now-1497302/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><b>10 Best Stocks Under $10 to Buy Now</b></a><b>.</b></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">In recent days, President Trump and his advisers have given mixed signals on the future of tariffs on China and on specific industries. Over the weekend, big American tech companies scored a victory when it was revealed that the US had not put tariffs on smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">However, on Sunday, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that these electronics would soon be covered under new tariffs, which would be different from those imposed on specific countries. President Trump also posted on social media that there would be “no exception” for these products. He also said that the government is looking at semiconductors and the entire electronics supply chain in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Last week was the best week for the major indexes since at least 2023. However, with all this uncertainty, Wall Street is getting ready for another week of potential tariff-fueled ups and downs.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">To compile our list of the 14 best American tech stocks to buy now, we used stock screeners from Finviz and Yahoo Finance to find the largest American technology companies. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 30 American stocks. Next, we focused on the 14 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database of more than 1,000 elite hedge funds. Finally, the 14 best American tech stocks to buy now were ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q4 2024.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:META), previously named Facebook, Inc., is an American multinational technology corporation that owns and operates Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company also offers a range of other devices, products, and services that are powered by AI and immersive technologies. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks among the best American stocks to buy right now.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">On April 10, Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion reduced the firm’s price target on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) from $775 to $610 but maintained an “Overweight” rating. This adjustment reflects a cautious stance due to the company’s exposure to e-commerce and China. Champion cited performance checks with an Ad Buyer that were considered the best in the group, and focused on Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) Q2 revenue guidance of $42.5 billion to $45.5 billion, representing an increase of 9 to 16.5% year-over-year. The analyst also expects the company’s management to reiterate their fiscal year 2024 operating expense forecast of $114 to $119 billion and capital expenditures forecasted at $60 to $65 billion. Additionally, updates on Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) advancements in AI, particularly Llama 4 and the agentic opportunity, are anticipated. The revised price target is also based on reduced revenue estimates for 2025 and 2026, which have been lowered by 2% and 4%, respectively.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Overall, META <b>ranks 3rd</b> on our list of the best American tech stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.
