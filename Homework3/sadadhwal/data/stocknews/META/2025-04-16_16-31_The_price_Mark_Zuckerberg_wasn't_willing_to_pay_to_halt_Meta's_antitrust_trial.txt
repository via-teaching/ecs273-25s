Zuckerberg also made two visits to the president's private Mar-a-Lago club. And Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Trump, according to the Wall Street Journal, did ask staff to work on a potential settlement. But Ferguson and the Justice Department's antitrust chief, Gail Slater, persuaded Trump to support their recommendation to proceed to trial.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">This week in court, the FTC wasted no time laying out evidence against Zuckerberg by calling the CEO as its first trial witness.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Instagram became the FTC's central topic as prosecutors confronted Zuckerberg with his past emails.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">In a 2012 email, Zuckerberg told Facebook's then-CFO, David Ebersman, that purchasing Instagram and other startups could be viewed as a way for Facebook to buy time.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">"Even if some new competitor springs up, buying Instagram, Path, Foursquare etc. now will give us a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again," Zuckerberg wrote, according to an account of the testimony <a class="link" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:reported;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/meta-ceo-zuckerberg-testifies-on-emails-about-instagram-whatsapp-deals?taid=67fe828fa4be1c0001c5bfd8&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;sref=eeq6exxF" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> by Bloomberg.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Zuckerberg agreed under questioning by the FTC's attorney that buying Instagram was intended to "neutralize a competitor," but he added that the purchase was also meant to boost Facebook's quality and functionality.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">​​"I read this as talking about incorporating the functionality and staying ahead in terms of quality. But scale is one aspect of that, and time is one aspect of that," Zuckerberg testified, according to Bloomberg.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">"It's not accurate to say that the only reason we were interested was the scale or growth rate, which I think that your question is implying."</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Zuckerberg's testimony concluded on Wednesday by addressing Facebook's view of the Chinese social media app TikTok launched in 2018.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Zuckerberg viewed the app's increasing popularity as a "highly urgent" threat and "we observed that our growth slowed down dramatically."</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">"TikTok is still bigger than either Facebook or Instagram, and I don't like it when our competitors do better than us," Zuckerberg said, according to reports.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Antitrust lawyers have said TikTok presents a potential sticking point for the FTC's case because the company offers similar services to Facebook and Instagram, yet is excluded in the group of companies that the commission claims compete in the market for personal social networking.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">"We haven't been shy about explaining why it doesn't make sense for the FTC to bring a case to trial that requires it to prove something every 17-year-old in America knows is absurd — that Instagram doesn’t compete with TikTok," a Meta spokesperson said.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">"We are prepared to win at trial."</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><em>Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The U.S. on Wednesday issued new sanctions targeting Iran's oil exports, including against a China-based "teapot refinery", as President Donald Trump seeks to ramp up pressure on Tehran and drive Iranian oil exports down to zero.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">The combination of an electronics tariff reprieve and dovish noises from the Federal Reserve have created a semblance of calm in financial markets, though the lingering trade war uncertainty means the respite probably won't last long.  * The Trump administration is proceeding with probes into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of a bid to impose tariffs on both sectors on national security grounds, Federal Register filings on Monday showed.  * The dollar held steady on Tuesday, trading near a three-year low against the euro and a six-month trough against the yen, as investors trying to make sense of the constant changes to President Donald Trump's tariffs remained wary of U.S. assets.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">One of the biggest two-day sell-offs in stock market history saw investors pile into the stock market earlier this month.</p>, <p class="modules-module_tipMessage__ZQFev">Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results</p>, <p class="redirectMsg">Sign in to access your portfolio</p>, <p>
