Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML (<a class="link" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" data-rapid_p="24" data-ylk="slk:ASML;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASML">ASML</a>) slid as much as 7.6%. The selloff in semiconductor stocks over the past three months has already wiped out about $2 trillion in market capitalization.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">President Donald Trump’s administration has barred Nvidia from selling its H20 chip in China, an escalation of Washington’s tech battle with Beijing. ASML later added to investor anxiety by posting orders that missed expectations and saying that it doesn’t know how to quantify the impact of recent tariff announcements.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The latest developments show how tariffs are already wreaking havoc on global companies, while the trade war is extending beyond mere import taxes as well. The fallout could weigh on chip-sector earnings and also set back China’s ambitions to compete on the global tech stage. ASML’s drop weighed on Europe’s technology sector, with losses across chip equipment peers pushing the Stoxx 600 Technology Index about 2.5% lower.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The H20 restrictions are “driven by concerns over China’s rise in the electronics sector, and in that sense, it is likely to become a permanent policy,” said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management. “It is expected to have a significant negative impact on semiconductor supply chain.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Trump’s war on trade is prompting economists to scale back their forecasts for GDP growth worldwide, casting doubt over the outlook for everything from smart-phone demand to computing. Even before Washington slapped additional tariffs on much of the world — only to roll them back shortly after — many industry analysts had questioned whether big tech firms from Microsoft Corp. to Meta Platforms Inc. will continue to buy Nvidia Corp. chips at the same pace in 2025.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Among key suppliers, Korean memory maker SK Hynix Inc. slumped 3.7% Wednesday. Top foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 2.5% ahead of results on Thursday. Japanese chip-equipment maker Advantest Corp. (<a class="link" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" data-rapid_p="29" data-ylk="slk:6857.T;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/6857.T">6857.T</a>) dropped 6.6%, extending its fall after ASML’s statement.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">TSMC was already likely to slow some production expansion on a weaker economic outlook, and “the tighter rules on Nvidia’s China sales might amplify the deceleration,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Ken Hui wrote in a note.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">For China, the broader restrictions raise concerns that access to global tech hardware will be further choked off. Exports of the most-advanced chips and equipment to the Asian nation are already banned, and the H20 is a scaled-down product specifically designed not to be too powerful.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Even after DeepSeek raised hopes that advances can be made in artificial intelligence and other fields without the most cutting-edge chips, China’s tech giants may suffer if curbs keep getting extended. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (<a class="link" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" data-rapid_p="35" data-ylk="slk:BABA;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA">BABA</a>, <a class="link" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" data-rapid_p="36" data-ylk="slk:9988.HK;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9988.HK">9988.HK</a>) sank as much as 5.4% in Hong Kong trading Wednesday, while Baidu Inc.

China has been able to develop innovative AI models despite US restrictions.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">—With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi, Kit Rees, Edwin Chan, Henry Ren and Kurt Schussler.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">(Adds market value data in first and second paragraphs, US premarket trading in second)</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" data-rapid_p="42" data-ylk="slk:GM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-04-14/inside-gm-mary-barra-s-35-billion-bet-on-electric-cars?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" data-rapid_p="43" data-ylk="slk:How Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/mar-a-lago-membership-fees-help-explain-trump-s-tariff-obsession?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">How Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" data-rapid_p="44" data-ylk="slk:Trade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/us-china-trade-war-clears-path-for-sodium-ion-batteries?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Trade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" data-rapid_p="45" data-ylk="slk:The Beauty Salon Recession Indicator;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-11/recession-indicator-us-hairstylists-report-clients-cut-spending?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Beauty Salon Recession Indicator</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" data-rapid_p="46" data-ylk="slk:Trump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-09/doge-government-cuts-are-pushing-out-the-wrong-people?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Trump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">©2025 Bloomberg L.P.</p>, <p class="type-body-xs-reg yf-rtg296">By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's

</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">U.S. markets fell sharply Wednesday, with chip stocks leading the retreat as U.S.-China trade tensions spooked investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 3.1%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 2.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 700 points, or 1.7%.
