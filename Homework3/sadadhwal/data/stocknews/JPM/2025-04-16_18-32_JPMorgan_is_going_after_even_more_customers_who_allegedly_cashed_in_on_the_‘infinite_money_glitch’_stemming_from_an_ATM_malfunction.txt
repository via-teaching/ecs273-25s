The practice, known as <a class="link" data-rapid_p="16" data-ylk="slk:check-kiting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/check-kiting" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">check-kiting</a>, is illegal.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">According to a Tuesday court filing in Gwinnett County, Georgia, seen by <em>CNBC, </em>one “masked man” deposited a $73,000 check in the defendant’s Chase bank account. Per the lawsuit, the check bounced six days later, but not before the defendant made a series of cash withdrawals worth $82,000. The defendant allegedly owes Chase nearly $58,000 and has not complied with requests to return the cash.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">JPMorgan has filed five total lawsuits on the state level: one each in New York, Florida, Georgia, and two in Texas, the company confirmed to <em>Fortune</em>. Since October, when JPMorgan first pursued litigation on the issue, the company has sent out more than 1,000 letters to customers asking them to repay the funds.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">“We’re still investigating cases of fraud and cooperating with law enforcement—and we’ll do that for as long as it takes to hold fraudsters accountable,” JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Drew Pusateri told <em>Fortune</em> in a statement.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Chase’s ATM woes aren’t unique. In August 2023, Bank of Ireland customers took advantage of an <a class="link" data-rapid_p="17" data-ylk="slk:ATM glitch;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://fortune.com/europe/2023/08/16/bank-of-ireland-free-money-glitch-lines-at-atms-police-garda-intervention-dublin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ATM glitch</a> that allowed them to pull large sums of money from their accounts and transfer up to €1,000 (~$1,090) to other accounts, even if the funds were more than what was available in their accounts, leading them to mistakenly think they were getting “<a class="link" data-rapid_p="18" data-ylk="slk:free money;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF8qvT7rF44" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">free money</a>.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The bank warned customers they would be liable for the money they withdrew and should return the cash, should they not be prepared to have the money debited from their accounts.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">JPMorgan has been clear in its views on schemes such as the one some took advantage of last year.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">“Chase takes its responsibility to combat fraud seriously and prioritizes protecting the firm and its customers to make the banking system safer,” the bank said in an October court filing. “Part of that responsibility is to hold people accountable when they commit fraud against Chase and its customers. Simply put, engaging in bank fraud is a crime.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">While legal consequences for check fraud vary by state and the amount of money taken, repercussions can be steep. In New York, it can result in up to 25 years in prison, Adam H. Rosenblum, an attorney and founder of Rosenblum Law, <a class="link" data-rapid_p="20" data-ylk="slk:told Fortune;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/03/free-money-viral-tiktok-chase-bank-glitch-fraud/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">told <em>Fortune</em></a> in September.
