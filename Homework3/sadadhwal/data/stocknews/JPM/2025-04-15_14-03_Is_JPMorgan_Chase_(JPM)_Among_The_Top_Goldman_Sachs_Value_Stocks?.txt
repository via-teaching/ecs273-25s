(NYSE:JPM) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">As we recently <strong><a class="link" data-rapid_p="14" data-ylk="slk:discussed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/deep-value-stocks-etfs-top-10-picks-2-1502740/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">discussed</a> </strong>in another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">So, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Warren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’s <a class="link" data-rapid_p="15" data-ylk="slk:Berkshire;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/berkshire-hathaway/1/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Berkshire</a> picks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Overall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio. So, let’s take a look at the top Goldman Sachs value stocks.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">A group of business people discussing plans around a boardroom table adorned with a financial services company logo.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">To compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (<strong><a class="link" data-rapid_p="17" data-ylk="slk:see more details here;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">see more details here</a></strong>).</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><b><i>Goldman Sachs' Q4 2024 Stake Value: $4,870,962,238</i></b></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><b><i>P/E Ratio as of April 11: 10.98</i></b></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><b><i>Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 123</i></b></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), a New York-based financial services giant, comes in third on our list of the best Goldman Sachs value stocks. Goldman owns 20.3 million JPM shares as of the fourth quarter of 2024, valued at $4.8 billion and representing 0.76% of the total portfolio.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">On March 12, Truist Securities maintained a Hold rating on JPM with a price target of $268. Truist noted that most of JPMorgan’s customers have good credit and have stayed steady during the ups and downs in the economy. The bank also has solid financials, shown by its consistent dividend policy.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">JPMorgan’s Q1 2025 profit went up 9% to $14.64 billion, or $5.07 a share. Even without a one-time gain from the First Republic deal, earnings stood at $4.91 per share. The company’s revenue rose 8% to $46.01 billion, supported by solid results in asset management, investment banking, and a notable 48% increase in equities trading. On March 18, 2025, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) declared a $1.40 per share quarterly dividend, a 12% jump from the prior dividend of $1.25. The dividend is payable on April 30, to shareholders on record as of April 4.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 123 funds reported owning stakes in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) at the end of Q4 2024, compared to 105 funds in the preceding quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s <strong><a class="link" data-rapid_p="19" data-ylk="slk:Viking Global;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/viking+global/31/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Viking Global</a></strong> was the leading stakeholder of the company, with 7.46 million shares worth $1.78 billion.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Overall, JPM <strong>ranks 3rd</strong> among the Goldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks. While we acknowledge the potential of value stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.
