In this article, we are going to take a look at where McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump’s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">In the second month of 2025, the US government’s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States’ tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">DW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods &amp; services in the latest round of “Trump Tariffs”. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering “continuous stagflation”, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">This scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children’s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children’s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President &amp; CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing:</p>, <p class="yf-1ba2ufg">“Make sure that money can be talked about, that there’s no taboos…so that your children are learning those really good financial literacy skills that they need to set themselves up for success for the rest of their life.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Investing in the markets for your children’s future has the advantage of time. In a report by MorningStar, investments in stocks have the added benefit of compounding return, which means the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to grow exponentially. CNBC reported on billionaire investor Mark Cuban and how he made billions from his first few million with a long-term view on his investments.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">To compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources and gathered the stocks they collectively favored. These stocks have a long-standing history of performance, with strong balance sheets and sound financials. Then, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database of billionaire stock holdings to arrive at our list of 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires as of Q4 2024. For the stocks with the same number of billionaire holdings, we have used the total value of billionaire holdings as a secondary metric to rank the stocks. Billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (<strong><a class="link" data-rapid_p="14" data-ylk="slk:see more details here;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">see more details here</a></strong>).</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">A cook in a busy kitchen assembling cheeseburgers for orders.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><em><strong>No. of Billionaires: 14</strong></em></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><em><strong>Value of total Investment by Billionaires: $0.830 billion</strong></em></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a global leader in the food service industry. The company operates and franchises McDonald’s restaurants worldwide, offering a diverse menu of food and beverages. McDonald’s utilizes various franchising models, including conventional franchises and developmental licenses, to expand its global reach. It is a household name, especially in the United States, with brands such as McChicken, BigMac, and many more under its umbrella.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) experienced a turbulent year-end. The United States food industry was in peril following news of an E. coli outbreak. As a result, negative goodwill towards the aforementioned brands was inevitable. The Q4 2024 earnings report revealed a drop in sales by 28% YoY to $6.93 billion and an EPS of $2.83. Chairman and CEO of MCD, Chris Kempczinski, spoke on the company’s performance during the earnings call, stating:</p>, <p class="yf-1ba2ufg">“First, we have the right strategy, accelerating the Arches. Our MCD growth pillars still offer significant growth opportunities and I’m pleased with the 2025 market plans, particularly their balance of value and full margin food innovation.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)’s cash position makes it one of the best kid-friendly stocks on our list. At the end of FY24, the company had approximately $1 billion available in cash and cash equivalents. Due to this cash generation, it has raised its dividends for 48 consecutive years, which is not an easy feat to achieve.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Overall, MCD <strong><b>ranks 8th</b></strong> on our list of best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of MCD, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.
