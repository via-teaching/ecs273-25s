But everyone's rolling up their sleeves at the volatility and tinkering with their portfolios, looking to optimize or take advantage of the moment.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">As my colleague <a class="link yahoo-link" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" data-rapid_p="29" data-ylk="slk:Josh Schafer reports;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-aggressively-buy-the-dip-as-trumps-tariff-turmoil-continues-to-shake-markets-133641635.html">Josh Schafer reports</a>, everybody's trading. Dip-buying flows following the week of “Liberation Day” reached record levels, according to data from VandaTrack, including $3 billion in net purchases on April 3. That was the largest daily total since VandaTrack began collecting the data in 2014.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Buying at recent lows and FOMO trading explained much of the heightened activity. But another interpretation is that an entire class of retail investor has been trained to throw their cash into stocks in a continuation of a pandemic-era shift in personal finance.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">You are probably better off not looking at your diminished 401(k) account when the market is convulsing. But pushing an order on a trading app has become something of a pastime for an increasingly large American demographic, the foundation for group chats among young people, and the basis for an entire genre of aspirational lifestyle content.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">That big banks' big shot clients are doing this too is a great "stars, they're just like us" moment. But it's also part and parcel of the same volatility that's been a hallmark of the 2025 stock market and a lesson in the importance of a diversified portfolio of banks' business lines.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">That these banks can up their profitability amid economic uncertainty and a lack of an anticipated IPO boom isn’t unique to volatile trading. <a class="link yahoo-link" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" data-rapid_p="31" data-ylk="slk:A similar dynamic was at play earlier this year;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-banks-enter-the-trump-era-on-a-high-note-morning-brief-110033964.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall">A similar dynamic was at play earlier this year</a>, when a major market narrative was whether the Fed would continue to ease rates. (The Fed cut rates in September, November, and December but has since paused.)</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Further rate cuts would have curtailed banks’ lending margins, which were supercharged by the central bank’s years-long tightening campaign. But the big banks could have done just fine in a low-rate environment because they can lean on other commercial operations to cover revenue losses elsewhere.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The diversified nature of financial services allows the nation's biggest banks to profit even when the outlook grows darker.
