Goldman Sachs Group beat earnings, with revenues hitting US$15b, ahead of expectations, and statutory earnings per share outperforming analyst reckonings by a solid 15%. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Our free stock report includes 2 warning signs investors should be aware of before investing in Goldman Sachs Group. <a class="link" data-rapid_p="12" data-ylk="slk:Read for free now;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://simplywall.st/company/id/5643A077-5A50-4885-A3AE-1E8731A7FD08?blueprint=3753923&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=risk-link&amp;utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Read for free now</a>.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Goldman Sachs Group from 16 analysts is for revenues of US$55.2b in 2025. If met, it would imply a modest 4.1% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to increase 2.3% to US$44.52. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$56.4b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$45.10 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><span class="veryHighlightLink"><a class="link" data-rapid_p="14" data-ylk="slk:See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://simplywall.st/company/id/5643A077-5A50-4885-A3AE-1E8731A7FD08?blueprint=3753923&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group </a></span></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">It will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$592. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Goldman Sachs Group analyst has a price target of US$720 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$490. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the <a class="link" data-rapid_p="15" data-ylk="slk:industry;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://simplywall.st/markets/us/financials/capital-markets?blueprint=3753923&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=industry&amp;utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">industry</a> itself. The analysts are definitely expecting Goldman Sachs Group's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 5.5% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 2.7% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 5.2% annually. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Goldman Sachs Group is expected to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$592, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.
