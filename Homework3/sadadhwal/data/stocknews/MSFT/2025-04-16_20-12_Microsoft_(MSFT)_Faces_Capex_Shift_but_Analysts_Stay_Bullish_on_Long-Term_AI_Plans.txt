In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other AI stocks you shouldn’t overlook right now.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">According to Adam Thierer, a senior fellow at the center-right think tank R Street Institute, Trump’s tariffs could prove to be a massive gift for China, even helping it catch up in the AI race.</p>, <p class="yf-1ba2ufg">“It’s going to be very hard for the U.S. to win the so-called AI Cold War if America’s trade policies are simultaneously tanking global markets, discouraging technological investments, and potentially undermining traditional alliances with key allies.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Trump’s policies are disrupting supply chains and causing volatility in global markets, which may lead US allies to turn to China to meet their technological needs.</p>, <p class="yf-1ba2ufg">“Suddenly, in the wake of this trade fiasco, we see EU officials saying, ‘Let’s get on the phone with China and talk. Huawei has this telecommunications hardware system they want to sell, and there’s also these AI models that are free of charge.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><strong>READ ALSO: <a class="link" data-rapid_p="13" data-ylk="slk:10 AI Stocks on the Move;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-ai-stocks-on-the-move-1508531/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">10 AI Stocks on the Move</a> and  <a class="link" data-rapid_p="14" data-ylk="slk:10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid Market Volatility;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-ai-stocks-to-watch-amid-market-volatility-1507757/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid Market Volatility</a>.</strong></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">With all the tensions caused by the US tariffs, China’s President Xi Jinping has recently called for stronger ties with Vietnam on trade and supply chains as he attended the signing of dozens of cooperation agreements between the two nations. While Beijing faces 145% U.S. duties, Vietnam has been negotiating a reduction of U.S. tariffs of 46% that would otherwise apply in July after a global moratorium expires, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>, <p class="yf-1ba2ufg">“The two sides should strengthen cooperation in production and supply chains,” Xi</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The President has also urged increased trade and stronger ties with Hanoi on artificial intelligence and the green economy.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Discussing the meetings, U.S. President Donald Trump said that the two countries’ discussions were focused on harming the United States. However, he said that he did not blame them for holding such talks.</p>, <p class="yf-1ba2ufg">“I don’t blame China; I don’t blame Vietnam. That’s a lovely meeting. Meeting like, trying to figure out, ‘how do we screw the United States of America?'”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points  (<strong><a class="link" data-rapid_p="15" data-ylk="slk:see more details here;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">see more details here</a></strong>).</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">A development team working together to create the next version of Windows.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><strong><em>Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 317</em></strong></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) provides AI-powered cloud, productivity, and business solutions, focusing on efficiency, security, and AI advancements. On April 15, Bank of America reiterated the stock as “Buy” and lowered its price target on the stock to $480 per share from $510.</p>, <p class="yf-1ba2ufg">“There have been rumors that Microsoft is pulling back on capex. While Microsoft is likely shifting capex within geographies, the company remains building capacity for the long term.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">A day prior, UBS also lowered the firm’s price target on the stock to $480 from $510 and kept a “Buy” rating on the shares. The firm’s price target revision also came after Microsoft’s formal acknowledgement that it is slowing or pausing some data center projects. The firm’s evaluation reveals that the company’s adjustments are most likely not AI demand-related, and that the pausing activity isn’t a materially negative AI demand signal.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Overall, MSFT <strong><b>ranks 2nd</b></strong> on our list of AI stocks you shouldn’t overlook right now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.
