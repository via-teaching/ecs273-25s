Yet this had less to do with its own operations, and more to do with a move by a business in which it's invested. That decline was steeper than even the gloomy <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> index's 2.2% fall on the day.</p>, <p>In an article published this morning and citing an unnamed "person familiar with the matter," Bloomberg wrote that leading <a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> company OpenAI is in active talks to acquire another privately held AI business called Windsurf. The deal's price tag is rumored to be around $3 billion. </p>, <p>While <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/11/10/microsoft-13-billion-openai-best-money-ever-spent/">OpenAI</a> is a separate entity from Microsoft, the tech giant has invested considerably in the company. It also uses its technology in a number of its products. </p>, <p>If a deal is reached at anywhere near the mentioned price, it would be OpenAI's priciest acquisition in its relatively short history. Windsurf is a developer of AI-assisted coding tools, which streamline the coding process by allowing users to use natural-language prompts to create programs.</p>, <p>Neither OpenAI nor Windsurf had commented on the Bloomberg report. Microsoft had also kept mum on the matter.</p>, <p>Of course any acquisition OpenAI makes doesn't directly affect Microsoft. The company has said, however, that it is entitled to share of profit distributions from OpenAI. Investors might feel that OpenAI -- and by extension, Microsoft -- is better off spending billions of dollars to continue developing still-fresh AI technology rather than a bolt-on acquisition.</p>, <p></p>, <p> </p>, <p></p>, <p>Before you buy stock in<span> </span><span>Microsoft</span>, consider this:</p>, <p>The Motley Fool <em>Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the<span> <strong><a href="https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=175d0603-abf0-4d99-8e6a-35db23c32306&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-sa-bbn-bn%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditxt0001087%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch%26ftm_pit%3D17454" rel="nofollow">10 best stocks</a></strong></span><span> </span>for investors to buy now… and <span>Microsoft</span><span> </span>wasn’t one of them.
