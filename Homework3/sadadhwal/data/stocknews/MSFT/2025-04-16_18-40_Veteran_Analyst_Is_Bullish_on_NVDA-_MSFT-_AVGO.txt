Additionally, it will benefit from huge capital expenditures by the major cloud players, including Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), Newman asserted.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><strong>Why Newman Is Upbeat on MSFT and AVGO</strong></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">MSFT will benefit from the large amount of revenue that it obtains from companies and its low exposure to consumers, Newman stated. Moreover, its high capital expenditures will improve its position coming out of any economic downturn, the tech analyst predicted.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">AVGO is helping the large cloud players develop their own AI infrastructure. Over the longer term, the major cloud developers will want to create a significant amount of such infrastructure to become more independent, according to Newman.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
