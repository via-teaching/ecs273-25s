Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, which is now based in Singapore, said in separate but nearly identical notices that their operating expenses have gone up “due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs.”  Both companies said they would be making “price adjustments” starting April 25, although neither provided details about the size of the increases.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">BNB Chain burned BNB tokens worth more than $900 million in the pursuit of its goal of reducing the circulating token supply to 100 million.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">The departures come approximately a month after the energy company once again pushed back the launch date for its first commerical-scale power plant and reupped cost estimates for the project.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">Johnson &amp; Johnson’s electrophysiology unit struggled in the first quarter, as the company chases Medtronic and Boston Scientific in the red-hot pulsed field ablation market.</p>, <p class="modules-module_tipMessage__ZQFev">Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results</p>, <p class="redirectMsg">Sign in to access your portfolio</p>, <p>
