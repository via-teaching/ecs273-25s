In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best dividend-paying stocks.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Dividend-paying stocks have consistently attracted investor interest due to their long-term value. CNBC highlights this by examining the historical performance of the broader market. Between 1960 and 2024, a $10,000 investment in the index would have grown to over $982,000 purely from stock price appreciation, based on data from FactSet and NYU Stern. However, many companies in the index also returned capital to shareholders through dividends. Had an investor reinvested those dividends over the years, the investment would have ballooned to approximately $6.42 million by the beginning of 2025.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">This outlook seems reasonable, especially when considering how crucial cash flow has become in today’s economic environment. Investors continue to favor income-generating assets, and dividends remain one of the most reliable ways to deliver that income. Reflecting this trend, several companies within the market have recently introduced dividend payments.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">According to S&amp;P Global, companies in the S&amp;P index now contribute roughly 85% of the total dividends paid across the market—up from 82% in 2024. This increase includes 2.7% of the total dividend pool coming from firms that only recently began issuing dividends. The top 29 companies in the index alone are responsible for 40% of all dividends paid by the index’s constituents and 35% of the total dividends across the entire US equity market. Under the current base-case forecast, these leading firms are expected to distribute a combined $280 billion in dividends. In a more optimistic (upside) scenario, that figure could climb by 2.75% to $288 billion, with major large cap companies projected to deliver the most significant gains by weighted average. If the most favorable (bull-case) conditions materialize, these 29 companies could boost total dividend payouts by an estimated 4.5%, contributing an additional 1% themselves.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">It’s no surprise, then, that dividends have become a central theme in many investors’ strategies. According to Brian Bollinger, founder of Simply Safe Dividends, focusing on companies that regularly pay dividends can offer a sense of reassurance. He further noted that younger investors, in particular, have the opportunity to build long-term dividend growth portfolios aimed at maximizing total return and capital appreciation over time.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">According to Nuveen, companies that focus on dividend growth tend to possess strong long-term fundamentals and may deliver relatively attractive performance in the year ahead. Historically, firms that consistently increased or initiated dividend payments have produced higher annualized returns and exhibited lower volatility compared to the broader equity market. While such companies may not lead in every market environment, their favorable risk-adjusted returns over extended periods make them a solid foundation for equity portfolios.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Nuveen also suggested that many firms remain in a strong position to continue raising dividends over time. In the US, corporate balance sheets are generally healthy, consumer spending remains steady, and earnings growth is projected to pick up pace in 2025. Data from FactSet shows that dividends per share for the S&amp;P index rose by 7.6% in 2024, with consensus forecasts pointing to a further 4.2% increase in 2025. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Aerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><em><strong>Our Methodology:</strong></em></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of the close of Q4 2024. From the top 60 companies, we selected 11 dividend stocks with yields of at least 1% as of April 12. These companies show strong financial performance and have solid records of paying dividends. The stocks are ranked according to the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (<strong><a class="link" data-rapid_p="13" data-ylk="slk:see more details here;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">see more details here</a></strong>).</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><em><strong>Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104</strong></em></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">An American multinational oil and gas company, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is a global leader in integrated energy and chemical operations, ranks at the top of the best oil and gas dividend stocks to consider. In Q4 2024, the company reported a revenue of $83.4 billion, reflecting a slight 1.1% dip from the previous year. Despite this, its long-term performance remained steady, supported by $12.1 billion in structural cost savings since 2019. These efforts have helped offset inflation and expansion costs while enabling it to outperform industry peers. For 2024, the company recorded a sector-leading return on capital employed at 12.7%, with a five-year average of 10.8%.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">With a strong cash flow position, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands out as a reliable dividend payer. It generated $55 billion in operating cash flow during 2024, marking its third-strongest year in the past decade. For Q4 alone, operating cash flow reached $12.2 billion, while free cash flow totaled $8 billion. The company returned $36 billion to shareholders in 2024, including $16.7 billion in dividend payments.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) boasts a rich dividend legacy, having paid shareholders for 143 consecutive years and growing its dividend consistently for the past 42 years. Currently, it pays a quarterly dividend of $0.99 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.84%, as of April 12.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Overall, XOM <strong>ranks 6th</strong> on our list of the best dividend paying stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.
