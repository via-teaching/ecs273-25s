But the sudden reversal by the Trump administration, after months of policy limbo and back-channel talks, signals another hard turn in trade policy — and lays bare the high-stakes game playing out among Silicon Valley, Washington, and Beijing.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Let’s rewind: On April 9, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang <a class="link" data-rapid_p="13" data-ylk="slk:attended;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-hosts-liv-golf-fundraiser-as-stocks-sink-over-tariffs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">attended</a> a $1-million-a-plate Mar-a-Lago dinner with President Trump, where AI exports were reportedly a topic of conversation. Proceeds from the dinner went to MAGA Inc., a Trump-aligned super PAC that can raise unlimited funds but isn’t allowed to coordinate directly with the campaign. Five days later, on April 14, the U.S. informed Nvidia it would need a license to export H20 chips abroad. On April 16, Nvidia announced the multibillion-dollar charge — and markets flinched.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Meanwhile, ASML (<a class="link" data-rapid_p="14" data-ylk="slk:ASML;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://qz.com/quote/ASML" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ASML</a>), the Dutch semiconductor equipment powerhouse, reported first-quarter sales of €7.7 billion — slightly below forecasts — and flagged “greater uncertainty” due to trade tensions. ASML makes the machines essential for cutting-edge chip production, giving it enormous influence over global chip supply. The company warned that new tariffs and tech restrictions could weigh on its outlook for 2025 and 2026.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Investors didn’t like what they saw.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Nvidia stock slid 6% at the market open Wednesday and retreated further in the afternoon before closing down about 7%, with AMD (<a class="link" data-rapid_p="15" data-ylk="slk:AMD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://qz.com/quote/AMD" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AMD</a>) and other chipmakers falling in tandem. The broader Nasdaq dropped over 3%, as Wall Street reassessed what a prolonged, escalating tech standoff could mean for supply chains, AI development, and the semiconductor industry.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">In a Wednesday note, Jefferies (<a class="link" data-rapid_p="16" data-ylk="slk:JEF;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://qz.com/quote/JEF" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JEF</a>) analysts said the H20 ban was expected — but the size of Nvidia’s write-down was not. It signals outsized demand from Chinese buyers, who had reportedly placed $16 billion in H20 orders this year. Still, Jefferies says China has likely stockpiled enough GPUs for ongoing AI training and will increasingly lean on local chips for inferencing tasks.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Markets may have priced in some pain, but they haven’t seen the last punch.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">For the latest news, <a class="link" data-rapid_p="17" data-ylk="slk:Facebook;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.facebook.com/quartznews" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a class="link" data-rapid_p="18" data-ylk="slk:Twitter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://twitter.com/qz" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a class="link" data-rapid_p="19" data-ylk="slk:Instagram;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://instagram.com/qz" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">Nvidia discloses that sales of its H20 chips to China would require a license ‘for the indefinite future’ from the U.S. Department of Commerce, AMD says a license requirement for chip exports will result in charges of up to $800 million, and ASML issues disappointing sales guidance.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">The Trump administration has effectively barred Nvidia from selling its custom artificial intelligence processors to customers in China.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">The chip maker will take a $5.5 billion charge in the current quarter for H20 inventory and canceled sales.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">Chip stocks fell after new export licensing requirements were imposed on Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">TSMC is a crucial player in the artificial-intelligence chip market, which has been upended by tariff turmoil.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">The S&amp;P 500 lost 2.2% on Wednesday, April 16, as the Federal Reserve chair discussed possible inflationary and economic consequences of tariffs.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">OMC's first-quarter 2025 earnings and revenues increase year over year.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">The stock market took a downward turn on Wednesday after Nvidia said it would take a $5.5 billion charge due to U.S. export restrictions on H20 processors to China and other countries.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">Abbott Labs posts first-quarter sales that missed analysts’ estimates but rose 4% from a year earlier.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">All is not lost when it comes to investing in Nvidia.
