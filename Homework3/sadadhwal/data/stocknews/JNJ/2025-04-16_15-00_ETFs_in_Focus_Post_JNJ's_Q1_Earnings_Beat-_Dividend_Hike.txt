The world's biggest healthcare products maker continued with its long streak of earnings beat and also exceeded revenue estimates. It raised its revenue guidance for this year amid tariff chaos and boosted its quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>Given the resilience of the drugmaker amid the potential tariff shifts under the Trump administration, investors should tap the company’s growth prospects through ETFs with the largest allocation to this diversified drug maker. These include <strong>iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF</strong> IHE, <strong>iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF</strong> IYH, <strong>First Trust Nasdaq Pharmaceuticals ETF</strong> FTXH, <strong>Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund</strong> XLV and <strong>VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF</strong> PPH.<br/><br/>JNJ’s first-quarter earnings per share came in at $2.77, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 and improved 2.2% from the year-ago earnings. Revenues grew 2.4% year over year to $21.89 billion and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.62 billion (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).<br/><br/>Innovative Medicines sales advanced 4.2%, while sales from MedTech devices jumped 4.1%. Sales of JNJ’s top-selling blood cancer treatment, Darzalex, jumped 20% to $3.2 billion, while Xarelto generated $690 million in sales, up 33% year over year. However, sales of the blockbuster psoriasis drug Stelara declined 34% to $1.6 billion due to the launch of several biosimilar versions entering the market. Invega Sustenna sales also dropped 15% to $903 million.<br/><br/>Johnson &amp; Johnson raised its revenue guidance for fiscal 2025 to $91.0-$91.8 billion from $89.2-$90.0 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 2.6%-3.6% versus the prior expectation of 0.5%-1.5%. The new guidance reflects the addition of Caplyta (lumateperone) following its $14.6 billion acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies. The company maintained its adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of $10.50-$10.70 due to tariff costs, dilution from the Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition, and updated foreign exchange. JNJ revealed tariff costs of roughly $400 million this year.<br/><br/>The drugmaker lifted its quarterly dividend to $1.30 per share from $1.24 per share, marking the 63rd year of consecutive increases. At the new rate, the annual dividend comes to $5.20 per share compared with the previous rate of $4.96 per share.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><strong>iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (IHE)</strong><br/><br/>iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF provides exposure to 37 companies that manufacture prescription or over-the-counter drugs or vaccines by tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Select Pharmaceuticals Index.
