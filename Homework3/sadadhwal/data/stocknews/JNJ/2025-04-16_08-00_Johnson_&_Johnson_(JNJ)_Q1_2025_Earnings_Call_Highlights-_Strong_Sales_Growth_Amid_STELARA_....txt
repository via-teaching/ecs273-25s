What is that on an annualized basis, and how do you plan to mitigate it? <strong>A</strong>: Joseph Wolk, CFO, explained that the $400 million primarily involves MedTech tariffs, including those from Mexico, Canada, and China. The most significant impact comes from US-origin products shipped to China. Mitigation strategies are limited due to existing contractual agreements, but tax policy is seen as a more effective tool than tariffs for building US manufacturing capacity.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><strong>Q</strong>: Can you explain the drivers behind the lower gross margins this quarter and the outlook going forward? <strong>A</strong>: Joseph Wolk, CFO, noted that the decline was due to the impact of STELARA's loss of exclusivity, Part D redesign, and unfavorable currency effects. He expects margins to improve by 100 to 150 basis points moving forward, despite the tariff impacts.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><strong>Q</strong>: How do you see the erosion of STELARA being offset by other brands like TREMFYA? <strong>A</strong>: Jennifer Taubert, EVP, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine, stated that the impact of STELARA's loss was in line with expectations, and the business excluding STELARA grew over 12%.

While elective procedures might be delayed, they are not abandoned. The company monitors job reports as an indicator of healthcare coverage and demand.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><strong>Q</strong>: Can you provide more details on the orthopedic sales decline and the recovery outlook? <strong>A</strong>: Tim Schmid, EVP, Worldwide Chairman of MedTech, explained that the decline was due to one-time events like revenue recognition changes and fewer selling days. Despite competitive pressures, the company expects improved performance due to new product launches and commercial execution.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the <a class="link" data-rapid_p="16" data-ylk="slk:full earnings call transcript;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JNJ">full earnings call transcript</a>.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">This article first appeared on <a class="link" data-rapid_p="17" data-ylk="slk:GuruFocus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2783034/johnson--johnson-jnj-q1-2025-earnings-call-highlights-strong-sales-growth-amid-stelara-headwinds?r=caf6fe0e0db70d936033da5461e60141" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GuruFocus</a>.<br/></p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">Last week's rally in the broader stock market indexes sprung the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) back upward after a more than 20% that technically put it into a bear market.
