At Morgan Stanley, Mike Wilson cut his 2025 earnings-per-share forecast to $257 from $271.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">“The 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs and further concessions over the weekend lessen the near-term probability of a recession, but uncertainty remains high,” said Wilson, who sees the S&amp;P 500 trading in a range from 5,000-5,500.

The selloff was worsened by Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs policy and the tit-for-tat spat with China. Investors are rushing to game out how the effective freezing of Chinese trade will impact companies and growth.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Morgan Stanley’s Wilson warned that the S&amp;P 500 could slump back below 5,000 and retest last week’s lows if 10-year Treasuries yields surge above 5% from the current 4.46%. A larger trade deal with China that significantly reduces tariffs still in place would cause significant upside, he said.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Read: ‘No Place to Hide’ as Stress Spreads Across Assets: Taking Stock</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The first signs of a slowdown in global trade are already emerging as companies around the world hit their own pause button on orders.
