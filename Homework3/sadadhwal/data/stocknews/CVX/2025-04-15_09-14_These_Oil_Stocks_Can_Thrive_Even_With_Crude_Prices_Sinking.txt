WTI, the primary U.S. oil price benchmark, has plunged from about $80 a barrel in early January to around $60 a barrel</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. The culprit has been the concern that tariffs will slow the global economy, driving down demand for crude oil. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lower crude prices will impact oil company cash flows. However, some </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/oil-stocks/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">oil stocks</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> are </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">in a better position</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to navigate the lower oil prices than others due to their </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">abundant</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> low-cost oil resources. Three oil companies that can still thrive in the current environment are </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Devon Energy</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> <span class="font-bold whitespace-nowrap" data-id="203351">(<a class="ticker-symbol" href="/quote/nyse/dvn/">DVN</a><span class="text-green-900 ticker-change"> 2.65%</span>)</span>, </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ConocoPhillips</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> <span class="font-bold whitespace-nowrap" data-id="203175">(<a class="ticker-symbol" href="/quote/nyse/cop/">COP</a><span class="text-green-900 ticker-change"> 0.69%</span>)</span>, and </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Chevron</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> <span class="font-bold whitespace-nowrap" data-id="203255">(<a class="ticker-symbol" href="/quote/nyse/cvx/">CVX</a><span class="text-green-900 ticker-change"> 0.65%</span>)</span>. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Devon Energy has a premier multibasin U.S. onshore resource portfolio. The company produces oil and gas from the Rockies, Delaware Basin, Anadarko Basin, and Eagle Ford. That diversification helps reduce risk and enhances its long-term growth profile. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Delaware Basin, which runs through west Texas and southeast New Mexico, is the crown jewel of Devon Energy's portfolio. The company gets 56% of its production from that world-class oil resource. That position will fuel the oil company for years to come. Devon has thousands of remaining drilling locations with an average breakeven level of $40 per barrel. Because of that, it can still make a lot of money drilling in the region at the current oil price point. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company's low-cost resources position it to produce a lot of cash even in the current environment. Devon was on track to make over $3 billion in free cash flow this year when WTI was above $70 a barrel during the first quarter. While that number will decline if crude remains around $60, Devon will still produce a lot of excess cash this year. It plans to return about 70% of that money to shareholders via its dividend and share repurchases, retaining the rest to strengthen its already rock-solid balance sheet. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ConocoPhillips has a global portfolio of low-cost resources. The company held about 20 billion </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.fool.com/terms/b/barrels-of-oil-equivalent/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">barrels of oil equivalent</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> resources with a supply cost below $40 a barrel for WTI. It added even more low-cost resources last year when it acquired Marathon Oil. That deal topped off its tank by adding more than 2 billion barrels of resources with an average </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">cost of supply</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> below $30 per barrel for WTI. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company's low-cost resources position it to produce a lot of cash in the current environment. ConocoPhillips initially expected to generate enough excess free cash flow this year to return $10 billion to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. While lower oil prices will impact the amount of excess free cash flow it produces this year</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, it</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> could still achieve that capital return target thanks to its cash-rich balance sheet. ConocoPhillips ended last year with $6.4 billion of cash and short-term investments and another $1 billion of long-term investments. Meanwhile, it's <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/03/this-top-oil-stock-is-looking-to-ring-up-a-1-billi/">working toward generating an additional $2 billion in cash via non-core asset sales</a>. </span></p>, <p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That integration between upstream (oil and gas production) and downstream (refining and chemicals) helps mute some of the </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">impact</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> of lower oil prices. The company also has a very low-cost global resource portfolio. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The energy giant has stress-tested its business for lower oil prices. Chevron forecasts that it can produce enough cash flow from operations to cover its high-yielding dividend (currently over 5%) and capital spending program at $50 oil through 2027 with room to spare. Meanwhile, the company has the balance sheet capacity to buy back shares at the low end of its $10 billion-$20 billion annual target range during that period at that price point. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Chevron is working to further enhance its low-cost resource portfolio by acquiring </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hess</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. The deal would add a world-class position in offshore Guyana and other high-quality assets to diversify and enhance Chevron's portfolio. It would further bolster the company's low-cost supplies, putting it in an even stronger position to thrive during </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">periods of</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> lower oil prices. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The recent downdraft in crude prices will impact the cash flows that oil companies produce. However, Devon Energy, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron have </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">very</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> low-cost operations and strong balance sheets. Because of that, they can still thrive at lower prices by producing lots of cash that they can return to investors through dividends and share repurchases. That makes them lower-risk ways to invest in the oil patch. </span></p>, <p></p>, <p> </p>, <p></p>, <p>Before you buy stock in<span> </span><span>Devon Energy</span>, consider this:</p>, <p>The Motley Fool <em>Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the<span> <strong><a href="https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=2558c999-5dd5-4206-98a2-0ce70cac9f77&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-sa-bbn-bn%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditxt0001087%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch%26ftm_pit%3D17454" rel="nofollow">10 best stocks</a></strong></span><span> </span>for investors to buy now… and <span>Devon Energy</span><span> </span>wasn’t one of them.
