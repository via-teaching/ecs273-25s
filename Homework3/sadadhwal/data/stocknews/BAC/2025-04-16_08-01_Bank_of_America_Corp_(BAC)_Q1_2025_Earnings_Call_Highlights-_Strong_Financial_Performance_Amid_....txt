We are growing into our capital by investing in the business, and we still have flexibility to increase the buyback. We don't have a specific CET1 target yet, as we await full clarity on capital requirements.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><strong>Q</strong>: What drove the strength in loan and deposit growth in Q1, and what is the outlook for commercial loan growth given policy uncertainties? <strong>A</strong>: Brian Moynihan, CEO: We've been investing in building more commercial bankers globally, which is now paying off. Despite potential economic changes, our increased capacity and use of AI for efficiency are driving growth. We expect this to continue across the board.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><strong>Q</strong>: What were the dynamics of setting the loan loss reserve this quarter, and how did you account for potential economic changes? <strong>A</strong>: Alastair Borthwick, CFO: We set reserves using data as of 3/31, with the ability to add judgmental layers. We use blue-chip economic indicators for baseline assumptions, which have moved down in terms of economic growth. Our reserve is set closer to an unemployment rate of around 6% for 2025-2026.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><strong>Q</strong>: How are you managing expenses, and is the full-year expense growth expectation of 2% to 3% still valid? <strong>A</strong>: Alastair Borthwick, CFO: Yes, we still expect full-year expenses to grow 2% to 3%. It might be towards the higher end, but it depends on fee developments throughout the year.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><strong>Q</strong>: How do you view the impact of potential rate cuts on your net interest income (NII) targets? <strong>A</strong>: Alastair Borthwick, CFO: We expect to maintain our Q4 NII target despite four anticipated rate cuts. The cuts are expected later in the year, so they won't significantly impact 2025 but may pose a headwind in 2026. Our long-term target remains a 2.3% NIM.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the <a class="link" data-rapid_p="15" data-ylk="slk:full earnings call transcript;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC">full earnings call transcript</a>.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">This article first appeared on <a class="link" data-rapid_p="16" data-ylk="slk:GuruFocus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2783036/bank-of-america-corp-bac-q1-2025-earnings-call-highlights-strong-financial-performance-amid-economic-uncertainties?r=caf6fe0e0db70d936033da5461e60141" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GuruFocus</a>.<br/></p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">Last week's rally in the broader stock market indexes sprung the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) back upward after a more than 20% that technically put it into a bear market.
