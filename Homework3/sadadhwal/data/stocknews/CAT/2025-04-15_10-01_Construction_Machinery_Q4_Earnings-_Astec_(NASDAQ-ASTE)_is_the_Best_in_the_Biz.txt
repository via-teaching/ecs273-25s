This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 4%, but it was still a strong quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts’ EPS estimates and an impressive beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Astec pulled off the fastest revenue growth but had the weakest performance against analyst estimates of the whole group. Unsurprisingly, the stock is up 9.3% since reporting and currently trades at $34.11.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Is now the time to buy Astec? <a class="link" data-rapid_p="18" data-ylk="slk:Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://stockstory.org/stocks/nasdaq/aste?utm_source=post-earnings&amp;utm_medium=yahoo&amp;utm_campaign=primary&amp;utm_article=AFF3aW8AYw%3D%3D&amp;utm_ticker=ASTE" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free</a>.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Contracted by the United States Navy during WWII, Manitowoc (NYSE:MTW) provides cranes and lifting equipment.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Manitowoc reported revenues of $596 million, flat year on year, in line with analysts’ expectations.

This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump’s presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by potential trade policy changes and corporate tax discussions, which could impact business confidence and growth. The path forward holds both optimism and caution as new policies take shape.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?
