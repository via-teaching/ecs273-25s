These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">To get a sense of who is truly in control of The Coca-Cola Company (<a class="link" data-rapid_p="13" data-ylk="slk:NYSE:KO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO">NYSE:KO</a>), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 64% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$15b in market cap last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 27%.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Coca-Cola, beginning with the chart below.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><span class="veryHighlightLink"><a class="link" data-rapid_p="14" data-ylk="slk:See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://simplywall.st/company/id/B91CD87D-B934-4EC9-9225-5FE1D12F8CC9?blueprint=3753455&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola </a></span></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">We can see that Coca-Cola does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Coca-Cola's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Coca-Cola is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.3% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.4% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.1% of the company stock.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Coca-Cola Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can <a class="link" data-rapid_p="18" data-ylk="slk:click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://simplywall.st/company/id/B91CD87D-B934-4EC9-9225-5FE1D12F8CC9/ownership?blueprint=3753455&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. </a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 26% stake in Coca-Cola. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Public companies currently own 9.3% of Coca-Cola stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Coca-Cola better, we need to consider many other factors.
