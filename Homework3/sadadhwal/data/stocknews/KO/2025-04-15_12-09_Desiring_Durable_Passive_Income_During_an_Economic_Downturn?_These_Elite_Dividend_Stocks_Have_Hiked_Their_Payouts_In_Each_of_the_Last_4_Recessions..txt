Meanwhile, </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">JPMorgan</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is even more bearish. Its recession model sees a nearly 80% chance the economy goes into a recession, up from 60% not long ago. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recessions tend to cause corporate profits to decline, which drives many companies to cut costs through layoffs and other initiatives. Some companies will even cut or suspend their </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.fool.com/terms/d/dividend-payments/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">dividend payments</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to shareholders to conserve cash. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, other companies are more recession-resistant due to the durability of their cash flows and the strength of their balance sheets. </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ExxonMobil</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> <span class="font-bold whitespace-nowrap" data-id="206209">(<a class="ticker-symbol" href="/quote/nyse/xom/">XOM</a><span class="text-green-900 ticker-change"> 1.04%</span>)</span> and </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coca-Cola</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> <span class="font-bold whitespace-nowrap" data-id="204186">(<a class="ticker-symbol" href="/quote/nyse/ko/">KO</a><span class="text-red-900 ticker-change"> -0.19%</span>)</span> have proven their ability to weather recessions over the decades. They've both increased their dividends throughout at least the past four recessions. There's a good chance they can withstand the next one with similar ease. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/XOM/chart/" target="_blank"><img alt="XOM Dividend Chart" src="https://media.ycharts.com/charts/7c4cae71915653303b2daa07544fa1c3.png"/></a></span></p>, <p class="caption"><a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/XOM/dividend" target="_blank">XOM Dividend</a> data by <a href="https://ycharts.com" target="_blank">YCharts</a>. Gray bars are recessions.</p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ExxonMobil hiked its dividend payment by 4% earlier this year, extending its streak to 42 years of annual payment increases. "We're proud </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">of the fact</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that we've increased our annual dividend per share for 42 years in a row, something only 4% of </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">S&amp;P 500</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> companies can claim," stated CFO Kathy Mikells during the oil giant's fourth-quarter earnings conference call. She continued, "And we plan for that track record to continue for decades </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">to come</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, which is only possible by investing in the high-quality growth </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">opportunities that drive leading returns and higher cash flows." </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The energy company has been investing heavily in transforming its business to dramatically improve its underlying earnings power while </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">also</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> expanding into lower-carbon energy. This strategy has boosted its earnings capacity by nearly $14 billion over the past five years on a constant price and margin basis. Exxon plans to invest over $140 billion into major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program through 2030, which, along with structural cost savings, should add another $20 billion to its annual earnings capacity. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">That incremental income will give Exxon even more fuel to grow its dividend, which is already on an incredibly safe foundation. Last year,</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Exxon produced $34.4 billion in free cash flow, easily covering its $16.7 billion dividend outlay. Meanwhile, it has a fortress balance sheet with an ultra-low 6% </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.fool.com/terms/l/leverage-ratio/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">leverage ratio</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and a massive $23.2 billion cash balance. These factors put the oil giant's 3.8%-yielding dividend on a rock-solid foundation that should continue withstanding recessions. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coca-Cola boosted its dividend payment by 5.2% earlier this year. That extended its dividend growth streak to 63 straight years. That raise kept Coca-Cola in the ultra-elite group of </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/dividend-stocks/dividend-kings/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dividend Kings</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, companies with 50 or more years of annual dividend increases. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company has benefited from the durable and growing demand for its beverage brands. Its portfolio features multiple billion-dollar brands that generate lots of free cash flow for the company. Coca-Cola expects to produce $9.5 billion in free cash flow this year, more than enough to cover its dividend outlay ($8.4 billion last year). The company also has a strong cash-rich balance sheet ($12.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments) with leverage at the low end of its target range. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coca-Cola's long-term target is to organically grow its revenue by 4%-6% annually, which should drive mid-to-high single-digit earnings-per-share growth. Meanwhile, the company can enhance its growth rate by making accretive acquisitions. That puts it in a strong position to continue increasing its </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2.9%-yielding</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> dividend. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Exxon and Coca-Cola have increased their dividends </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">every year</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for several decades, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">which includes</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the last four recessions.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">They're in excellent positions to continue raising their payout during the next downturn, whether </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">that happens</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> later this year or </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">further</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in the future.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Because of that, they're great dividend stocks to buy for a durable passive income stream. </span></p>, <p></p>, <p> </p>, <p></p>, <p>Before you buy stock in<span> </span><span>ExxonMobil</span>, consider this:</p>, <p>The Motley Fool <em>Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the<span> <strong><a href="https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=c4e4f305-fa80-42d7-ae77-68a242e7ce55&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-sa-bbn-bn%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditxt0001058%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch%26ftm_pit%3D17339" rel="nofollow">10 best stocks</a></strong></span><span> </span>for investors to buy now… and <span>ExxonMobil</span><span> </span>wasn’t one of them.
