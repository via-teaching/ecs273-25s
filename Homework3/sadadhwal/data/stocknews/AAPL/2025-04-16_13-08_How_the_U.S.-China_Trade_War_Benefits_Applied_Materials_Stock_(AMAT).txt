Despite a recent rebound, shares trade ~30% below their 52-week highs, with the decline somewhat justified. Indeed, higher costs and global trade tensions could dent the company’s near-term prospects. Still, the effort to restore chip manufacturing to U.S. soil promises a lucrative payoff in the long run. Given this narrative and AMAT’s unmatched role in chip production, I’m bullish on the stock.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with <a class="link" data-rapid_p="21" data-ylk="slk:Top Smart Score Stocks.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks/?llf=rss&amp;utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Top Smart Score Stocks.</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using <a class="link" data-rapid_p="22" data-ylk="slk:Tipranks' Stock Screener.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.tipranks.com/screener/stocks/?llf=rss&amp;utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Tipranks' Stock Screener.</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Even with a <a class="link" data-rapid_p="24" data-ylk="slk:90-day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/analysts-share-mixed-reactions-on-trumps-90-day-tariffs-pause?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">90-day </a><a class="link" data-rapid_p="25" data-ylk="slk:tariff;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tariff</a> pause on semiconductors and electronics announced last Friday, it’s clear that Applied Materials faces choppy waters. The remaining 10% global tariff hike will undoubtedly damage chipmakers like Intel (INTC) and TSMC (TSM), who depend on imported wafers, gases, and components. This will squeeze their budgets, potentially freezing orders for AMAT’s high-end tools.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Take its $20 million etching systems, for instance, or its deposition chambers, critical for cutting-edge chips. China’s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods further threaten AMAT’s foothold in a market that, for context, accounted for 30% of last year’s $26.5 billion in revenue.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The uncertainty is already biting. A single delayed fab can wipe out $500 million in AMAT orders, and with Asian chipmakers like Samsung rethinking expansion amid tariff chaos, you can see why the market might think that AMAT’s multi-billion-dollar backlog risks stalling. And then you have a story about Trump’s looming semiconductor-specific tariffs, which the market expects to hit within months. Undoubtedly, they keep customers jittery, as they are reluctant to greenlight projects when costs could spike overnight. It’s like a waiting game where hesitation makes more sense than action, leaving AMAT to tread carefully through a murky year.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">If AMAT’s outlook wasn’t already wobbly, the company’s supply chain isn’t immune. Tariffs on niche materials, like high-purity silicon or rare-earth metals, could inflate costs, forcing the company to either absorb the hit or pass it on, risking customer pushback. So, for now, AMAT stock is facing pressure on multiple fronts.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Despite the potential headwinds I just mentioned, investors should keep their minds open and consider that a bullish case might be hiding in the shadows. If Trump’s dream of a U.S. chipmaking renaissance pans out, maybe, just maybe, Applied Materials could be the golden goose. Tariffs are designed to lure chipmakers to American soil, and AMAT, the king of deposition and etching tools, is primed to cash in.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">New fabs in places like Ohio or Arizona would devour AMAT’s machines, each plant potentially funneling $1 billion in orders for systems that layer and sculpt chips for AI, EVs, and defense. The <a class="link" data-rapid_p="29" data-ylk="slk:CHIPS Act’s $52 billion war chest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-wants-to-end-chips-act-tsm-and-intc-could-be-biggest-losers?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CHIPS Act’s $52 billion war chest</a> already greases the wheels, and tariffs could kneecap foreign rivals like ASML (ASML), whose scanners might face a looming 20% import tax with further increases on the table.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Beyond fab construction, AMAT is also poised to ride the wave of state-of-the-art packaging and <a class="link" data-rapid_p="32" data-ylk="slk:AI;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AI</a> chip demand. Tariffs will likely incentivize U.S. production of complex chipsets, including Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPUs or Apple’s (AAPL) M-series, requiring AMAT’s advanced 3D stacking and hybrid bonding tools.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Industry projections suggest advanced packaging revenue could hit $79 billion by 2034. AMAT’s early lead in this niche could drive billions in orders as domestic firms like Intel scale up to compete globally. If tariffs lock in this shift, AMAT’s role as a tech enabler makes it a leader in America’s chip revival.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">After last week’s selloff, Applied Materials’ stock seems compelling, especially assuming the bullish case plays out. Down 30% from its 52-week peak, the stock trades at about 15x forward earnings. Analysts have trimmed their forecasts, yet <a class="link" data-rapid_p="33" data-ylk="slk:AMAT is still set to churn out $6 billion in free cash flow this year;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amat/financials?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AMAT is still set to churn out $6 billion in free cash flow this year</a>, which is not too bad compared to last year’s ~$7 billion, considering the circumstances. Its $1.63 billion net cash pile also adds flexibility liquidity-wise, letting AMAT invest while peers might think twice about spending these days.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">On Wall Street, analysts appear quite bullish on GM stock. The stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 16 Buy, four Hold, and one Sell ratings over the past three months. <a class="link" data-rapid_p="35" data-ylk="slk:AMAT’s average price target of $203.87;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amat/forecast?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AMAT’s average price target of $203.87</a> implies a 41% upside potential over the next twelve months, aligning with my view that the stock is currently undervalued.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">In the grand scheme, short-term tariff troubles may be a speed bump for Applied Materials. The industry giant’s critical role in the semiconductor production chain positions it to benefit significantly if U.S. chipmaking takes off. Yes, near-term volatility is real, with delayed fab projects, hesitance to spend, and potential cost hikes weighing on the stock.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Yet these hurdles could also fast-track a domestic manufacturing boom, funneling billions toward AMAT’s advanced tools for AI, 3D packaging, and beyond. For these reasons, I believe that AMAT remains a long-term play worth watching, especially for politically savvy tech-sector investors.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-rapid_p="38" data-ylk="slk:Disclaimer &amp; Disclosure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.tipranks.com/glossary/d/disclaimer-disclosure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Disclaimer &amp; Disclosure</a><a class="link" data-rapid_p="39" data-ylk="slk:Report an Issue;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.tipranks.com/glossary/c/contact-editor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Report an Issue</a></p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">AMD said Tuesday that some of its central-processing units for data centers will be made at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s site in Arizona.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid Market Volatility.
