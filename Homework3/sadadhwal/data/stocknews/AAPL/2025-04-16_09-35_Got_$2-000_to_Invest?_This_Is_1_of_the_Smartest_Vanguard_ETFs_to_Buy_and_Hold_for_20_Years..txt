The company offers a growing list of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that allow you to invest broadly in the stock market or focus on specific themes or types of stocks. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of its many funds is the </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> <span class="font-bold whitespace-nowrap" data-id="221822">(<a class="ticker-symbol" href="/quote/nysemkt/vig/">VIG</a><span class="text-red-900 ticker-change"> -1.51%</span>)</span>. It's one of the smartest funds to buy because it tracks the performance of companies that grow their dividends. Historically, dividend growth stocks have delivered the highest total returns with the lowest risk. That makes this a great fund to buy and hold for 20 years to grow </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">your</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> wealth. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/how-to-invest-in-vig-etf/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> aims to track the performance of the </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">S&amp;P U.S. Dividend Growers Index</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. The managers of that index designed it to measure the performance of U.S. companies that have consistently increased their dividends for at least the past 10 years. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Of note</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, it excludes the top 25% highest-yielding dividend stocks because these companies typically have higher dividend payout ratios and lower growth profiles. Those characteristics put them at a higher risk of stopping growth or reducing their dividends in the future. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The ETF's focus on companies that grow their dividends and are at lower risk for a future reduction is worth noting, given the data on dividend stocks by their policies: </span></p>, <p>Dividend Policy</p>, <p>Average Annual Total Returns</p>, <p>Dividend growers and initiators</p>, <p>10.2%</p>, <p>Dividend payers</p>, <p>9.2%</p>, <p>No change in dividend policy</p>, <p>6.8%</p>, <p>Dividend cutters and eliminators</p>, <p>(0.9%)</p>, <p>Dividend non-payers</p>, <p>4.3%</p>, <p>Equal-weighted S&amp;P 500 index</p>, <p>7.7%</p>, <p class="caption"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Data sources: Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As that table shows, dividend growers have produced the best returns among dividend stocks by policy while also significantly outperforming non-dividend-payers. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The ETF has delivered similarly strong returns throughout its history. Since its inception in 2006, the ETF has produced a 9.6% annualized return. Meanwhile, its return over the past 10 years is 11.3%. To put that into perspective, $2,000 invested into the fund at its inception nearly 20 years ago would have grown into about $12,500 today at a 9.6% average annual return. </span></p>, <p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, <em>Stock Advisor’s</em> total average return is <strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span></span>818<span>%</span></span></strong> — a market-crushing outperformance compared to <strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">156<span></span>%</span></strong> for the S&amp;P 500.</span></strong></p>, <p>They just revealed what they believe are the <strong><a href="https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=b2cac148-9caa-4e88-8bbc-b38894134751&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-sa-bbn-bn%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaediica0000025%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Din_line_article_pitch%26ftm_pit%3D17171" rel="nofollow">10 best stocks</a></strong> for investors to buy right now…</p>, <p><em><span style="color: #767676; font-size: 8pt;">*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025</span></em></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF currently holds 337 stocks. It has a higher weighting toward the biggest dividend growth stocks by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.fool.com/terms/m/market-cap/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">market cap</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. Currently, the top 10 holdings comprise nearly 32% of its assets. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, these are the cream of the crop </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">when it comes to</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> dividend growth stocks. For example, the fund's top holding is tech titan </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apple</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> <span class="font-bold whitespace-nowrap" data-id="202686">(<a class="ticker-symbol" href="/quote/nasdaq/aapl/">AAPL</a><span class="text-red-900 ticker-change"> -3.82%</span>)</span>, at 4.9% of the fund. The company has increased its payout for 14 straight years while growing it at a nearly 8% annual rate over the past decade. While Apple currently offers a low <a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/d/dividend-yield/">dividend yield</a> of 0.5%, that payout is extremely safe. Apple produced nearly $30 billion in cash from operating activities last quarter, easily covering its $3.8 billion dividend outlay. Meanwhile, with its earnings up 10% last quarter and growing, Apple should have no trouble continuing to increase its dividend in the future. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apple is </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">just</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> one of the many high-quality dividend growth stocks among the fund's top 10 holdings. Other notable names are </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Visa</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, with 16 years of dividend increases; </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ExxonMobil</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, with 42 years of dividend growth; and </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Walmart</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, with 52 years of increasing its dividend. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One final </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">thing to point out</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is that because the fund focuses on dividend growth and excludes higher-yielding dividend stocks, it has a lower dividend yield than some other dividend-focused ETFs: It recently yielded around 1.7%. However, the fund should still deliver attractive total returns in the future as the underlying companies grow their earnings and dividends, which should steadily increase their stock prices. </span></p>, <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dividend growth stocks have historically outperformed </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">other</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> dividend stocks and dividend non-payers over the long term. Given its focus on dividend growth stocks, buying the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is wise. The fund should deliver strong total returns over the decades, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">which should enable</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> investors </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">to meaningfully increase their wealth by buying and holding this fund</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>, <p></p>, <p> </p>, <p></p>, <p>Before you buy shares in the <span>Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF</span>, consider this:</p>, <p>The Motley Fool<em> Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the <strong><a href="https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=770949a5-5e0d-45b3-b79e-6a61ee3864f4&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-sa-bbn-bn%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditxt0001087%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch%26ftm_pit%3D17454" rel="nofollow">10 best stocks</a></strong> for investors to buy now… and the <span>Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF</span> wasn’t one of them.
