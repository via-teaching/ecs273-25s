Speaking on the company’s earnings call, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon said in part: “I would I would say the level of uncertainty is up significantly and it’s partially up because growth was slowing down before we got to the implementation of trade policy” and the implementation of trade policy reset the prospect of forward growth “pretty significantly all over the world.” Solomon added: “I would say that when you get outside of the U.S. and I listened to CEOs, I hear a greater sense of short term concern, but everyone would like less uncertainty and more clarity on forward policy and that’s what we’re hearing from clients… Investors invest by predicting the future and they obviously like less uncertainty. So they can have a better window into predicting the future. My guess is over time this level of uncertainty will come down and my general message to people is to go slow.”
