We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.
On Friday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer outlined what investors should focus on in the week, especially pointing to earnings reports from major banks.
“Rumor, innuendo, intrigue these are the stuff of great novels, of fabulous miniseries, riveting plays, and now they’re the stuff of the stock market.”

He noted the chaotic nature of the current environment and remarked that “this tape has it all,” and emphasized how unpredictable developments from the White House have added to the turbulence. Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes.
“Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,” he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, “Except this isn’t an eight-part blockbuster, it’s our money.” Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday’s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic.
Cramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a “liberation day bottom,” a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, “Not sure, I’m just not sure.” He added:
“Have you ever noticed the weekends don’t provide relaxation anymore because the president’s got advisors? He’s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He’s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime…. Monday’s trading, well, let’s just say that it looks like that it’s earning season so it’s gonna be even harder than usual.”

Calling UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) a “universal buy”, Cramer said:
“How about a gimme? I think this company’s the only gimme that I’ve seen this week. This is as close to one as you’re gonna find, not too high a price-to-earnings multiple, not yet overly loved, purely domestic business, has pricing power. This is it. It’s a universal buy.”
UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is a healthcare organization that offers health plans, care services, pharmacy support, and wellness programs. It also delivers software, consulting, and data tools to companies in the healthcare sector. Burke Wealth Management stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:
“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH): Before I discuss our decision to reduce United Health, I want to express our sadness and disgust regarding the tragic murder of UHC CEO Brian Thompson. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family. His murder played no role in our decision to reduce UNH.
Overall, UNH ranks 12th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.
