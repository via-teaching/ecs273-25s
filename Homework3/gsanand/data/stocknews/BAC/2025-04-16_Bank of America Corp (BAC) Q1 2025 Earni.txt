Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) reported a strong net income of $7.4 billion and $0.90 in EPS for Q1 2025, marking an 11% increase in net income year-over-year.
The company achieved a 6% revenue growth year-over-year, with net interest income growing by 3%.
Deposits grew for the 7th consecutive quarter, reaching nearly $2 trillion, an 8% increase from mid-2023.
The wealth management division added 7,200 net new households and saw net AUM flows of $24 billion in the quarter.
The company maintained a strong balance sheet with over $200 billion in regulatory capital and nearly $1 trillion in liquidity, supporting client solutions effectively.
Non-interest expenses increased to $17.8 billion, driven by seasonally elevated payroll taxes, litigation costs, and market-related expenses.
Provision expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion, indicating ongoing caution in asset quality management.
The company faces potential headwinds from expected interest rate cuts, which could impact net interest income growth in the future.
There is uncertainty in the economic outlook due to market volatility and potential changes in tariffs and policies, which could affect loan demand and growth.
The commercial loan growth, while strong, is subject to concerns over potential weakening in loan demand due to economic uncertainties and policy changes.
Q: Given the uncertainty in the environment, what level of CET1 are you comfortable running with, and can the $4.5 billion buyback level be sustained? A: Alastair Borthwick, CFO: We ended the quarter with $7 billion in earnings, allowing us to increase the share buyback from $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion. We are growing into our capital by investing in the business, and we still have flexibility to increase the buyback. We don't have a specific CET1 target yet, as we await full clarity on capital requirements.
Q: What drove the strength in loan and deposit growth in Q1, and what is the outlook for commercial loan growth given policy uncertainties? A: Brian Moynihan, CEO: We've been investing in building more commercial bankers globally, which is now paying off. Despite potential economic changes, our increased capacity and use of AI for efficiency are driving growth. We expect this to continue across the board.
Q: What were the dynamics of setting the loan loss reserve this quarter, and how did you account for potential economic changes? A: Alastair Borthwick, CFO: We set reserves using data as of 3/31, with the ability to add judgmental layers. We use blue-chip economic indicators for baseline assumptions, which have moved down in terms of economic growth. Our reserve is set closer to an unemployment rate of around 6% for 2025-2026.
Q: How are you managing expenses, and is the full-year expense growth expectation of 2% to 3% still valid? A: Alastair Borthwick, CFO: Yes, we still expect full-year expenses to grow 2% to 3%. It might be towards the higher end, but it depends on fee developments throughout the year.
Q: How do you view the impact of potential rate cuts on your net interest income (NII) targets? A: Alastair Borthwick, CFO: We expect to maintain our Q4 NII target despite four anticipated rate cuts. The cuts are expected later in the year, so they won't significantly impact 2025 but may pose a headwind in 2026. Our long-term target remains a 2.3% NIM.
