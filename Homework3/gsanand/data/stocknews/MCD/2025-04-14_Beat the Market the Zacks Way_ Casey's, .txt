Last Friday, the three most widely followed benchmark indexes closed a volatile yet winning week. The Nasdaq Composite, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 7.3%, 5.7% and 5%, respectively.
Throughout the week, trade was influenced by tariff reprieves announced on European goods and a trade war between the United States and China. The S&P 500 and the Dow registered their biggest weekly percentage gains since November 2023, and the tech-focused Nasdaq claimed its biggest advance since November 2022. For March, inflation numbers both on the consumer and producer side came in negative, against expectations.
Consumer sentiments, however, have declined further, and all eyes are currently set on developments from the White House and its multi-front tariff war.
Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market.
As usual, Zacks Research guided investors over the past three months with its time-tested methodologies. Given the prevailing market uncertainty, you may want to look at our feats to prepare better for your next action.
Here are some of our key achievements:
Shares of Palomar Holdings, Inc. PLMR have gained 16.5% (versus the S&P 500’s 12.4% decrease) since it was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on February 18.
Another stock, Heineken N.V. HEINY, which was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) also on February 18, has returned 2.4% since then.
A hypothetical portfolio of Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy) stocks returned -3.48% in January 2025 (through February 3rd) vs. -0.60% for the S&P 500 index and -2.75% for the equal-weight version of the index
This portfolio returned +22.3% in 2024, vs. +28% for the S&P 500 index and +19.9% for the equal-weight version of the S&P 500 index. 
This hypothetical portfolio returned +20.63% in 2023 vs. +24.83% for the S&P 500 index and +15% for the equal-weight S&P 500 index. 
The portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 stocks is an equal-weight portfolio, while the S&P 500 index is a market-cap-weighted index that has been notably distorted by the concentrated performance of mega-cap stocks since late 2022. 
The Zacks Model Portfolio - consisting of Zacks Rank #1 stocks – has outperformed the S&P index by almost 13 percentage points since 1988 (through the end of January 2025, the Zacks # 1 Rank stocks generated an annualized average return of +23.9% since 1988 vs. +11.3% for the S&P 500 index).

Shares of Munchener Ruckversicherungs MURGY and Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. SFM have advanced 11.7% (versus the S&P 500’s 10.1% fall) and 9.7% (versus the S&P 500’s 10.9% fall) since their Zacks Recommendation was upgraded to Outperform on February 27 and February 24, respectively.
While the Zacks Rank is our short-term rating system that is most effective over the one- to three-month holding horizon, the Zacks Recommendation aims to predict performance over the next 6 to 12 months. However, just like the Zacks Rank, the foundation for the Zacks Recommendation is trends in earnings estimate revisions.
The Zacks Recommendation classifies stocks into three groups — Outperform, Neutral and Underperform. While these recommendations are determined quantitatively, our analysts have the flexibility to override them for the 1100+ stocks they closely follow based on their better judgment of factors such as valuation, industry conditions and management effectiveness than the quantitative model.
