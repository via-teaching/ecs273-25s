Bullion rose to top $3,230 an ounce, less than $15 below the peak set in the first trading session of the week. The US Commerce Department said Monday it had initiated probes into the national security impact of semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports, a precursor to imposing tariffs.
The precious metal has rallied by more than a fifth this year as the worsening trade war has damped prospects for global growth, eroded trust in usually-safe US assets and roiled financial markets.
Leading banks remain optimistic about bullion’s prospects over the coming quarters as investors add to holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded funds and central banks continue to accumulate the metal. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has forecast that prices will rally to $4,000 an ounce by mid-2026.
Gold may also find support from strong demand in China, the world’s biggest bullion market. As the trade war has intensified, there’s been a surge in speculative trading, as well as inflows into local ETFs.
“Yuan devaluation, macroeconomic volatility, and rising dedollarization rhetoric are classic, powerful drivers of gold demand” in China, said Justin Lin, a Sydney-based analyst at Global X ETFs. Globally, “a further rally will likely require a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve, or clearer signs of a material slowdown in the US economy,” he said.
Gold rose by 0.6% to $3,230.36 an ounce at 4:18 p.m. in New York. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was up 0.3% after a five-day drop. Silver inched lower, while platinum and palladium gained.

U.S. policy on stablecoins offers European citizens an attractive payment method for cross-border transactions which should trigger more concern than trade tariffs, Italy's economy minister said on Tuesday.  Addressing an event in Milan on asset management, Giancarlo Giorgetti said European Union authorities should adopt further steps to boost the status of the euro as an international reference currency and complained about the fragmentation of the EU's payment industry.  U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to overhaul rules on cryptocurrencies and reverse a crackdown on the sector that took place under his predecessor Joe Biden.
