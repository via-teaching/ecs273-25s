STELARA faced an approximate 810 basis points headwind due to biosimilar competition, impacting overall sales growth.
Gross margins were below recent trends, affected by the loss of exclusivity for STELARA and Part D redesign.
The orthopedic segment experienced a decline of 3.1%, impacted by competitive pressures and one-time events.
Tariffs, particularly those related to China, are expected to have a significant impact on costs, with a $400 million impact anticipated in 2025.
The company faces ongoing litigation challenges related to the Talc bankruptcy ruling, which could impact future financial performance.
Q: Joe, you mentioned $400 million in tariffs in the 2025 guidance. What is that on an annualized basis, and how do you plan to mitigate it?A: Joseph Wolk, CFO, explained that the $400 million primarily involves MedTech tariffs, including those from Mexico, Canada, and China. The most significant impact comes from US-origin products shipped to China. Mitigation strategies are limited due to existing contractual agreements, but tax policy is seen as a more effective tool than tariffs for building US manufacturing capacity.
