Johnson & Johnson forecasts about $400 million in costs this year related to tariffs on medical devices, said Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk in an interview. Wolk said the estimated costs represent a "worst-case scenario" and take into account President Trumpâ€™s 90-day pause, China's retaliatory tariffs and the resumption of the U.S. tariffs. J&J isn't doing anything differently yet in response to tariffs, Wolk added.
