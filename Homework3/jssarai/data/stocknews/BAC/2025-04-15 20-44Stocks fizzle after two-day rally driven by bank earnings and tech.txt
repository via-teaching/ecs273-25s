Stocks closed lower Tuesday, snapping a two-day rally as investor jitters returned to the fore.
The S&P 500 slipped 0.22%, the Dow fell 0.36%, and the Nasdaq edged down 0.05%. Despite recent gains, all three major indices remain well below their pre-April 2 levels, when President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements first rattled markets.

Auto stocks fell despite fresh rumors of a possible reprieve on tariffs. Ford, GM, and Rivian each ended the day lower, following a new forecast from S&P Global Ratings (SPGI) projecting a 700,000-unit drop in annual U.S. car sales if tariffs move ahead. “Affordability challenges and elevated interest rates are already pressuring demand,” analysts wrote. “Tariffs would only exacerbate those headwinds.”
Tech and financial names led the upside among individual stocks. Palantir surged more than 6% following news that NATO finalized its purchase of the company’s AI-powered Maven Smart System. Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 5% amid ongoing activist investor pressure, and Netflix (NFLX) added nearly 5%. Bank of America and Citigroup also posted solid gains after beating first-quarter earnings expectations, fueled by strong trading revenue and consumer banking results.
Investors are now looking ahead to fresh earnings from United Airlines (UAL) and The Trade Desk (TTD), both due after the bell, and to a Wednesday slate that includes Abbott Labs (ABT) and U.S. Bancorp (USB)—reports that should offer further insight into consumer health and the state of regional lending.
Stocks opened higher Tuesday, with tech and bank names leading the charge as investors welcomed a morning packed with strong earnings and fresh deal buzz. Big banks were in rally mode: Citigroup, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs all ticked higher after posting better-than-expected results,fueled by strong trading revenues.
Palantir Technologies jumped 4% after NATO finalized its purchase of the company’s AI-powered Maven Smart System — another boost for the defense-tech darling after Monday’s rally. Apple also edged higher, extending its 2% gain from Monday, which followed a surprise tariff exemption from the Trump administration.
Meanwhile, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) caught a wave of investor enthusiasm after activist firm Elliott Investment Management revealed a $1.5 billion stake and backed the company’s newly announced strategic review. The broader market got a lift as chipmakers, software stocks, and AI plays rode the wave, with early signs pointing to a tech-led session and plenty of earnings drama still to come.
