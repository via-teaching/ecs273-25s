HalliburtonHAL andNabors Industries Ltd.NBR have reached a breakthrough by completing the first fully automated surface and subsurface execution of rotary and slide drilling operations in Oman. This breakthrough sets a new standard for land-based drilling, showcasing the power of advanced digital technologies to improve efficiency and performance in the oil and energy sector.
At the core of this technological feat lies the powerful integration of Halliburton’s LOGIX automation platform and Nabors' SmartROS rig operating system. Together, these cutting-edge solutions enabled a closed-loop drilling system that dramatically enhanced operational efficiency, consistency and real-time decision-making. Wells delivered ahead of schedule, with higher average rates of penetration and reduced non-productive time, set a benchmark for future digital drilling initiatives.

This achievement is not just a technical milestone, it is a statement of leadership. Halliburton and Nabors, a Hamilton-based oil and gas drilling company, have showcased how synergized digital ecosystems can transform complex drilling operations into streamlined, autonomous processes. The integration of advanced real-time analytics, remote control and data-driven orchestration allowed for seamless management of drilling parameters, setting a new standard for precision and performance.
Steve Haden, senior VP of Project Management at Halliburton, highlighted the success of the breakthrough in improving efficiency, consistency and reliability. The wells were completed ahead of schedule, with better drilling rates and less downtime, showcasing the Houston, TX-based oil and gas equipment and services company’s leadership in drilling automation.

What makes this accomplishment even more remarkable is its immediate impact on well construction timelines. The automation of both rotary and slide drilling not only optimized performance but also reduced drilling time, a critical factor in improving the economic viability of oil and gas projects in the region. By minimizing human intervention and maximizing system intelligence, Halliburton and Nabors proved that digital automation is not a vision for the future, rather, it is a powerful solution available today.

The strategic importance of this development goes far beyond a single project in Oman. As global energy demands grow, the need for faster, safer and more cost-effective drilling operations becomes paramount. This milestone sets a precedent not only for the Middle East, a hub for oil and gas activity, but also for global markets looking to adopt automated, data-centric drilling solutions. By leveraging the power of digital platforms like LOGIX and SmartROS, Halliburton and Nabors have created a model that other operators can replicate, enhancing global competitiveness and supporting a transition toward more intelligent energy exploration.
