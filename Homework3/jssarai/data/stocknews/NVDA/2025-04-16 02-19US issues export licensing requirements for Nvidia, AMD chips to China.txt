(Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Tuesday it was issuing new export licensing requirements for Nvidia's H20, AMD's MI308 artificial intelligence chips, as well as their equivalents, to China.
"The Commerce Department is committed to acting on the President's directive to safeguard our national and economic security," a Commerce spokesperson said.
Nvidia said earlier on Tuesday that it would take $5.5 billion in charges after the U.S. government limited exports of its H20 artificial intelligence chip to China, a key market for one of its most popular chips.
