We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Hints at a Bigger Agenda Behind Tariffs and Breaks Down These 7 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. In his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer suggested the recent tariffs might not simply be about economic leverage. He hinted at a deeper agenda within parts of the administration that goes beyond trade policy: “There’s plenty of sense that something’s going to happen that’s going to take this away. In fact, just because of what we saw the other day with it going to 10 percent, I don’t see that at all. I think these are very different kinds of tariffs. I mean, this is a tariff where I think there’s some people with the administration who actually ultimately have a goal of regime change.“ READ ALSO: Jim Cramer Reacts to the Surprise Market Surge and Highlights 8 Key Stocks and Jim Cramer Questions Market Logic and Dissects These 7 Key Stocks  Discussing the likelihood of a negotiated settlement between Washington and Beijing, Cramer expressed deep skepticism that China would retreat under pressure. Instead, he described a Chinese leadership that had long prepared for confrontation: “When do the Chinese back down? Right now they’re not, but I don’t know. I think the Chinese have been ready for this since first Trump. I think that they are ready for tariffs. I think they’re going to build coalitions worldwide. I do not think they’re paper tigers. I think that they’re a strong country and they’re ready. They’re ready for the fight. And I’m afraid that we have many divisions that were behind enemy lines before this war started, including Apple.” To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on April 11th.

Here are his comments: “You have a stock like, again, the key to the market is NVIDIA, where you had a price target cut for the first time. The stock’s still up. […] While revisiting the AI and semiconductor trade, Jim Cramer laid out his theory on why NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is still a winner, saying: “Okay, here’s my theory. And so far, okayed by the powers that be. There is a shift from hyperscaler to others who need the latest and greatest. What does that mean? And by the way, Grace Blackwell sold out, which is the current chip, sold out. […] And I will tell you that if you’re a robot maker, you need all the ones that you can possibly get. Self-drive, you need all these. These are not hyperscale. […] I think what you find is that people who have felt that NVIDIA was an easy short, maybe not so easy.” Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.
