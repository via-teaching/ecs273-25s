Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) just made a bold AI moveand it's one investors should keep a close eye on. The company has integrated Google's Gemini into Reddit Answers, its conversational search tool launched late last year. This isn't just another tech upgrade. It's a strategic expansion of its earlier partnership with Google Cloud, now tapping into the power of Vertex AI to serve fast, relevant summaries from Reddit's deep content pool. In short: Reddit wants to be the place users stay to find answersnot bounce from to Google. The timing couldn't be better. OpenAI and others are already using Reddit data to train their own bots, but now Reddit's pushing back, offering its own built-in AI assistant to deliver curated answers from real user conversations. Sure, early reviews are mixedsome call it a Grok knock-offbut others say it's already useful for quick how-to queries and crowd-tested advice. Think: how to clean a rusty cast iron pan without scrolling through 57 conflicting threads. For investors, this is where it gets interesting. Reddit Answers isn't just about UXit's about monetization and moat-building. If this AI integration boosts engagement and keeps users in-app longer, Reddit could turn more of its 70M+ daily users into ad revenue. Post-IPO, Reddit needs catalysts like this. And this Gemini play? It might just be the one that turns Reddit's content goldmine into a defensible edge in the AI arms race. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.
