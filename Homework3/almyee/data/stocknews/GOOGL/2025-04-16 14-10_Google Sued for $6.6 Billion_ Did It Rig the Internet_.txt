Alphabet's Google (GOOGL) just got hit with a lawsuit that could cost up to 5 billion ($6.6 billion)and it's not coming from regulators this time. A massive UK class action claims Google weaponized its default search engine status to freeze out competitors and force British businesses to overpay for digital ads. Filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal, the lawsuit says Google struck deals with Android phone makers and paid Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to make its search engine the default across devices, locking in market control and pushing ad prices higher than they should've been. Leading the charge is competition law expert Or Brook, who argues UK businesses had no real choice: if you wanted visibility online, you had to play by Google's rulesand pay up. The claim alleges that Google built a walled garden around search ads, where it not only dominated volume (over 90% of UK searches) but also offered enhanced functionality only through its own channels. Over 200,000 businesses are said to have been impacted. Brook didn't hold back: Google has been leveraging its dominance in the general search and search advertising market to overcharge advertisers. Google's response? Predictable. The company called the lawsuit speculative and opportunistic, and insists people use Google because it's helpfulnot because they're forced to. But the timing couldn't be worse. Britain's Competition and Markets Authority is already investigating Google's grip on digital ads, and the global antitrust spotlight on Big Tech is only getting brighter. If this legal fight gains momentum, it could mark a major turning point in how digital ad ecosystems are governedand priced. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Alphabet (GOOG) has received quite a bit of attention from Zacks.com users lately. Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects. LONDON (Reuters) -Alphabet's Google is being sued in Britain for potential damages of up to 5 billion pounds ($6.6 billion) in a class action alleging the company abused its dominant market position in the online search industry.  The class action, filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal on Tuesday, argues that Google's actions enabled it to charge higher prices for the advertisements that appear in search inquiries than it otherwise could in a competitive market.  It said the U.S. tech giant contracted phone makers to pre-install Google Search and the Chrome browser on Android devices and paid Apple to make it the default search engine on iPhones, with the intention of shutting out competition.
