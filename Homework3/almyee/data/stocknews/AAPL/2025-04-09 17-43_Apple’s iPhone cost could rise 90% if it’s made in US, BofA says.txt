(Bloomberg) — It’s possible for Apple Inc. (AAPL) to move iPhone production to America, but it would almost double the cost of making the device while creating logistical headaches, according to Bank of America. “iPhone cost can increase 25% purely on higher labor cost in the US,” BofA analysts led by Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. While the tech giant can find domestic labor for assembly, a “significant portion” of parts used in manufacturing the iPhone would still be assembled in China and imported to the US, they added. Assuming Apple has to pay reciprocal tariffs on those imports, its total cost would rise 90% or more, they estimated. The estimate comes as President Donald Trump zeros in on China for his trade fight. The Trump administration paused its reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries for 90 days, but increased its duties on China to 125%. Meanwhile, China slapped 84% retaliatory levies on American goods. Apple shares are soaring on the news, up more than 10% for their best day since July 2020. But the stock has taken a beating this year, losing 23%, and is down 14% since Trump’s tariff announcement on April 2, erasing $479 billion in market capitalization. Rosenblatt Securities warned last week that levies could “blow up” the stock. And Wedbush’s Dan Ives, a long-time technology bull, cut his price target, noting that a tariff fight would be a “complete disaster” for the company. Meanwhile, fear of price increases spurred iPhone panic buying last weekend. For Apple to make relocating its final assembly of iPhones to the US viable, it would need tariff waivers on components and sub-assemblies manufactured outside of the country, Mohan wrote. However, he doesn’t see this happening. “Unless it becomes clear as to how permanent the new tariffs are, we do not expect Apple to take the step of moving manufacturing into the US,” said Mohan, who holds a buy rating and a $250 price target on the stock, which is currently trading above $190. “We do expect, however, that Apple will continue to diversify its supply chain, and also increase production of iPhones in other countries such as India.” —With assistance from Ryan Vlastelica.
