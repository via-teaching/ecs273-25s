With most of Apple’s iPhones made in China, analysts at Bank of America have warned that shifting production to the US will be “logistically challenging” and lead to a spike in costs. President Trump has raised tariffs on China to 125pc from 104pc, while also pausing higher tariffs for dozens of other nations for 90 days. However, they will be hit with a baseline rate of 10pc. The move is designed to push more manufacturing to America but doing so is likely to raise production costs, the bank warned. “While it may be possible to move final assembly to the US, moving the entire iPhone supply chain would be a much bigger undertaking and would likely take many years, if even possible,” said a research note from the bank, which crunched the numbers using the 104pc tariff rate. The analysts said that iPhone costs could increase 25pc “purely on higher labour cost in the US” but could spike much more if Apple has to pay tariffs on each small part. “If Apple had to pay reciprocal tariffs to import sub-assemblies into the US, we see the total cost of an iPhone increasing 90pc+,” the analysts warned. The note has emerged days after Howard Lutnick, US Commerce Secretary, said in an interview that an “army of millions and millions of human beings, screwing in little screws to make iPhones – that kind of thing is going to come to America”. Apple has already said that it will spend $500bn (£400bn) and hire 20,000 new staff in the US, although a large chunk of those jobs are expected to be in artificial intelligence. Trump’s tariffs have prompted Apple’s shares to spiral in recent days, which cost the company its spot as the world’s most valuable company. The tariffs have originally impacted not only China but also Vietnam and India, where the tech giant has moved parts of its production in recent years. Mr Trump signalled on Wednesday he was pausing higher tariffs on these countries. Although the UK should, in theory, be unaffected, some UK-based experts believe there could also be some stockpiling here from distributors and shoppers. Harry Mills, of currency firm Oku Markets, said the increase in prices to consumers “could be £300 or more as the tech giant updates its pricing to reflect its newly higher costs. “The mobile phone sector moves quickly, and large wholesalers, distributors and resellers may stockpile devices ahead of anticipated price rises”. However, Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight, said it “would be a risky move” for UK businesses to stockpile iPhones given the continued uncertainty and rapidly changing situation. He said: “Demand is unlikely to change dramatically in the UK at present, so the danger for any company taking this route is that they could be left with excess stock and an unwanted liability on their balance sheet.” Von der Leyen urged to take ‘rapid and radical action’ as president says tariffs on pharmaceuticals coming ‘shortly’ A stock market crash can be alarming -- but for the well-prepared investor, it can also be an exceptional opportunity to build long-term wealth.

Vladimir Putin appeared to get off scot-free during Donald Trump’s tariffs blitz last week. Japan will sell more rice from its emergency stockpile through July in an attempt to stabilise soaring prices, the agricultural minister said Wednesday."In order to stabilise rice prices that have soared, the government will sell off its reserve rice every month until this summer" when newly harvested rice enters the market, agricultural minister Taku Eto said.

European Union counter-tariffs on U.S. goods starting next week are set to halt a large flow of U.S. corn to Europe and raise costs for buyers chasing alternative supplies of the feed grain, traders and industry representatives said.  Grain market reaction has been restrained so far with traders unsure if a barrage of tariffs, including tit-for-tat U.S. and Chinese duties, will stay in place or be removed following negotiations.  The EU will impose a 25% duty on corn (maize) from April 15 in response to U.S. steel and aluminium tariffs. Germany's new government pledged support for its car industry while also vouching for converting available plants for defence, a document on the coalition agreement reached by the country's conservatives and Social Democrats and seen by Reuters showed.  The parties planned to provide purchase incentives for electric cars, including plug-in hybrids and cars fitted with range extenders to boost an EV's battery, and promised tax discounts for company cars including an exemption from vehicle tax for electric cars to last until 2035.  The new government will also examine whether it can support converting and upgrading surplus car plants for use by the defence industry, as defence companies seek more capacity amid a Europe-wide push to ramp up production of military equipment in the face of waning support from the United States. US tariffs are affecting up to €67bn of EU automotive industry exports, the majority of which are coming from Germany. BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes must choose between pausing shipments or absorbing tariff costs.View on euronews Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results Sign in to access your portfolio
