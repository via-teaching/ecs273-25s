A dealmaking freeze and the biggest stocks rout since 2023 are raising the stakes for Wall Street’s earnings season Three major U.S. indexes the Nasdaq Composite, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed deeply in red by 9.89%, 9.58% and 8.78% respectively, last week. The stocks have taken a beating after the implementation of President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariff policies with major trading partners on April 2, 2025. Uncertainty over the impact of such policies on the U.S. economy has stoked fear of a near-term recession among market participants. Analysts are expecting a slowdown in economic growth and a spike in short-term inflation due to the aggressive shift in U.S. foreign policies. The core personal consumption expenditure (PCE),  inflation (excluding volatile items like food and energy) the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge marked the biggest monthly gain of 0.4% in February since January 2024. Over all the PCE index, rose 2.5% on a year-over-year basis in February, unchanged from January data. According to the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) report, manufacturing and services PMI (purchasing managers’ index) for March contracted to 49% and 50.8% compared with 50.3% and 53.5% in February. Any reading below 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activities. The labor markets have shown signs of cooling down due to strict immigration policies, widespread layoffs of federal workers, and reluctance by businesses to increase hiring amid the escalating global trade war. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for February marked the lowest level since September 2024. Job openings fell 194,000 to 7.568 million in February. The employment index declined to 46.2% in March from 53.9% in February.

While the Zacks Rank is our short-term rating system that is most effective over the one- to three-month holding horizon, the Zacks Recommendation aims to predict performance over the next 6 to 12 months. However, just like the Zacks Rank, the foundation for the Zacks Recommendation is trends in earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Recommendation classifies stocks into three groups — Outperform, Neutral and Underperform. While these recommendations are determined quantitatively, our analysts have the flexibility to override them for the 1100+ stocks they closely follow based on their better judgment of factors such as valuation, industry conditions and management effectiveness than the quantitative model.
