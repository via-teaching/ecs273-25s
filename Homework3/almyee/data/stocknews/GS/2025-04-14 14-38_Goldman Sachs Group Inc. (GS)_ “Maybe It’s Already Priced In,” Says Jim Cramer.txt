We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Reacts to the Surprise Market Surge and Highlights 8 Key Stocks In this article, we are going to take a look at where Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) stands against other key stocks that Jim Cramer highlights. In his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer analyzed the extraordinary market turnaround following President Trump’s unexpected 90-day tariff reprieve. Cramer explained just how abruptly the momentum changed: “The word that I kept hearing about is failed, that it would be a failed auction. It wasn’t. And therefore, it was a save. Once that save was made, in part because what the president did, you overrun what was the easiest trade of the year, which was the short Mag 7, short technology, short semiconductors, and everything reversed. Now, see, today, if you’re short – and the shorts are more or less the motif – they’re feeling good because it’s down, but they’re going to cover. They’re going to cover because they got hurt so badly yesterday that their bosses are saying, we want your books more. That’s historically what happens in these situations. So you may see all these down, but they’re not going to go back to where they were because we’re building in estimate cuts for everybody. And once they’re all built in, then it’s like 87. They’re all built in, and then you got to start figuring out. He was building too low.” READ ALSO: Jim Cramer Questions Market Logic and Dissects These 7 Key Stocks and Jim Cramer Says Tariff Pain Isn’t Over Yet And Reviews These 9 Stocks He also painted the market as a high-stakes showdown between short sellers and bulls, warning that the tide may have turned decisively: “It’s a great day for the longs, bad day for the shorts. […] What I’m talking about is that it’s a battle between longs and shorts. And the shorts are trying to keep their jobs after being victorious for so long. And the longs are revelling in what happened here because the 10%, except for, of course, what you talked about, which is the embargo.” Finally, Cramer credited a single Trump tweet with flipping the entire market narrative: “Yes, we are, given the fact that we should be in a hot seat estate, which is, we’re on a recession territory, ground, so whatever you want to say, until the tweet. Is that not insane? That a tweet came out and we went from being a recession to being up. […] The guy gave you the best call I’ve seen in my career, and yet there are people who are critical of that. I mean, come on. He got the Nasdaq to have the greatest single day ever, and he let you in. How many strategies have that kind of power?

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81 While previewing upcoming bank earnings, Jim Cramer analyzed Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS), suggesting that its current valuation may already reflect investor pessimism. Here are his remarks: “Well, the only reason I mention is Goldman’s about to report, okay? And David, Goldman is at the fulcrum of everything. It’s down 20 today. It was up big yesterday. It sells at 11 times earnings. And what I’m getting at is that maybe at 11 times earnings, if they miss the number, it doesn’t go down that much. […] So maybe instead of doing 12, maybe they do 11 and the stock doesn’t get hit.  Because it’s selling at nine times next year’s earnings. So this is what I’m talking about. Right now, at this moment, people are recalibrating and maybe they say, you know what, I knew Goldman was going to be bad. It was bad. Okay, next.” Overall, GS ranks 3rd on our list of key stocks that Jim Cramer highlights.
