The trade war between two of the world’s biggest economies, China and the US, is deepening even further. In a tit-for-tat retaliatory move, China has imposed an 84% tariff on all imports from the US starting April 10. This move comes after Trump’s duties on Beijing, which have now been increased even further to a whopping 145%.
Tech stocks have been plunging in response. Apple, for instance, has been doing the majority of its manufacturing in China, and the trade war is likely going to raise the price of its iPhones. Even though President Trump has confidence that the tech giant can make its phones in the U.S., experts aren’t so sure.

According to Needham analyst Laura Martin, reshoring iPhone manufacturing may take years and result in the price of iPhones skyrocketing. Similarly, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has said that an iPhone would cost $3,500 if produced in the U.S.
Nevertheless, President Donald Trump has just announced a 90-day pause on his administration’s “reciprocal tariffs.” These would have affected the company’s production locations in Vietnam, India, and Thailand.
Amid all this chaos, artificial intelligence continues to make leaps and bounds. In recent news, Silicon Valley startup Lightmatter has revealed it has developed a new type of computer chip. This chip is capable of both speeding up artificial intelligence work and using less electricity in the process.
The company is one of the few that seeks to use beams of light to move data between computers, instead of electronic signals. However, the company also believes that it can use these very beams of light to carry out the computation.
“What we’re doing is looking at the future of where processors can go. We fundamentally care about computers, and this is one of the alternative paths. There’s trillions of dollars of economic value that’s behind the idea that computers will keep getting better.”
In other news, President Donald Trump has recently told Cabinet members that billionaire Elon Musk will leave his administration role in the coming months. Musk has been the subject of hate after his efforts to cut the federal workforce. His involvement in politics has been hurting his company as well.
“I think he’s been amazing, but I also think he’s got a big company to run … And at some point, he’s going to be going back. He wants to. I’d keep him as long as I could keep him.”

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a global technology company. On April 9, Bank of America reiterated the stock as “Buy” but lowered its price target to $640 from $765 due to growing macroeconomic uncertainty.
The analysts told investors in a research note how they believe that ad spending pressure will materialize due to the latest tariff announcements and other negative headlines. The firm is lowering its ad spend estimates for Meta, which has deeper ad auctions, a higher mix of direct response revenues, and a 2%-3% foreign exchange benefit, by roughly 4%.
Last Saturday, the company unveiled the first models from its latest open-source artificial intelligence software, Llama 4. However, its biggest and most powerful Llama 4 model, the Llama 4 Behemoth model, is still in training and is yet to be released.
Overall, METAranks 3rdon our list of AI stocks to watch now.
