Goldman Sachs earnings beat Q1 views as global banking revenue offset declines elsewhere. The Dow giant was cautious on Q2. But GS stock rose.
Does JPM stock deserve a place in your investment portfolio after posting an upbeat Q1 performance? Let's find out.
Goldman Sachs (GS) opened the floodgates on first-quarter earnings Monday, reporting a 15% jump in profit to $4.74 billion, or $14.12 per share. Strong trading revenues fueled the beat, and shares climbed 1.7% at the open — despite being down about 14% year-to-date.
While the top- and bottom-line numbers for Goldman (GS) give a sense of how the business performed in the quarter ended March 2025, it could be worth looking at how some of its key metrics compare to Wall Street estimates and year-ago values.
Despite the tariff respite, investors shouldn't assume it is back to business as usual for Apple. The iPhone maker's valuation multiple will need to take into account the incredible leverage the Trump administration now has over the company.
A day after President Trump and administration officials warned about looming tariffs on semiconductors and other tech products, Nvidia said it will work with chip manufacturers and packaging firms to make supercomputers that power artificial intelligence entirely in the U.S.  The company says it will be the first time AI supercomputers are completely built domestically.  Tech-industry analysts have warned that Trump’s tariffs will weaken the U.S. in its AI race with China.
Zai Lab Limited (ZLAB) saw its shares surge in the last session with trading volume being higher than average. The latest trend in earnings estimate revisions could translate into further price increase in the near term.
A surge in trading activity fueled by investor uncertainty about President Trump’s policies is minting money for  Goldman Sachs  and other big banks.  The Wall Street firm joined  JPMorgan Chase  and  Morgan Stanley  in reporting a bigger profit for the first quarter, fueled by record revenue in its equities trading and lending unit.  Banks have been raking in fees as investors reposition their portfolios in anticipation of how Trump’s trade and other economic policies might rattle markets.
Goldman Sachs  reported first-quarter profit that beat analysts’ expectations as tumultuous markets proved a double-edged sword: The bank’s trading business boomed, benefiting from market swings, while revenue from investment bankers’ advisory work declined.  New York-based Goldman reported $4.74 billion of profit, or earnings per share of $14.12, on revenue of $15.06 billion in the first quarter.  Analysts expected Goldman to report per-share earnings of $12.33 on revenue of $14.77 billion, according to estimates compiled by FactSet.
