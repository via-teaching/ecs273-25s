We recently published a list of the11 Cheap NYSE Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other cheap NYSE stocks.
On March 26, Jack Caffrey of JPMorgan Asset Management provided an analysis of market trends in a discussion on CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’. He emphasized diversified portfolios built around different exposures during periods of volatility. Caffrey believes in the importance of ‘time in the market’ over ‘timing the market’. He highlighted the difficulty in predicting when fear or euphoria will dominate, as some of the best market days follow extreme pessimism. Caffrey also discussed the October sell-offs in 2022 and 2023, where many strategists expected further market tests at levels like 3200 or 3300 on the S&P 500. However, instead of panic selling, the market experienced rebounds in 2023 and 2024. He observed that implied volatility reached the high 20s during recent corrections, but did not indicate widespread panic.
Caffrey also discussed how the MAG7 drives market trends. While these stocks led growth in early 2020, their momentum eventually faded. This led to corrections instead of broadening. Investors began exploring second and third derivative trades stemming from AI developments, such as increased electricity demand and improvements in natural gas markets. He noted that mean reversion often occurs when primary trades become well-understood and widely owned. He suggested that markets would likely be led by earnings rather than valuation. Caffrey acknowledged that while some stocks within the MAG7 have posted earnings growth that makes their valuations more reasonable, traders are increasingly seeking opportunities in overlooked sectors like energy and businesses benefiting from a weaker dollar. For instance, oil prices have remained down despite energy leading the market performance this year.
Stimulus measures in Europe are also shifting from monetary to fiscal policies, which creates additional opportunities for investors.
