We recently published a list of11 Best Digital Payments Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stands against other best digital payment stocks.
Digital payment stocks are companies that specialize in designing, developing, or administering digital payment solutions. These firms use technology to enable electronic transactions between individuals, businesses, and institutions. Businesses that provide services such as online payment gateways, mobile payment apps, and peer-to-peer payment platforms can all be considered digital payment stocks. These technologies include digital wallets, payment processing systems, and blockchain-based payment solutions.
The global digital payment market is booming. According to Grand View Research’s report, the global digital payment market is anticipated to reach $96.07 billion in 2023, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.1% between 2024 and 2030. In terms of solution insights, payment processing led the market with 26.18% of worldwide revenue in 2023. North America dominated the market, accounting for 33.9% of total revenue in 2023. Europe is projected to see a substantial CAGR between 2024 and 2030.
Meanwhile, according to Marqueta’s 2024 State of Payments Report, 46% of survey respondents in the USA reported using some type of contactless payment during the last seven days. This is in contrast with 80% in the United Kingdom and 69% in Australia. Emerging technologies such as cryptocurrencies and the metaverse aim to drive payment innovation and borderless payment choices for customers.
As perMcKinskey‘s survey, in 2024, around 90% of consumers in both the US and Europe said they made at least one digital payment in the past year, with usage in the US hitting a record 92%. The survey defines digital payments as transactions completed online—through websites or apps—or in physical stores using dedicated apps like digital wallets. In-app and in-store payments contributed to this expansion, with digital wallet usage for in-store transactions rising from 19% in 2019 to 28% in 2024. This expansion reveals a $10 trillion annual market for both regions. Notably, 20% of digital wallet users in the country occasionally leave home without their traditional wallets, underlining the trend toward digital-first transactions.
There is also a difference in customer preferences between the US and Europe. European users prefer to choose local solutions like iDEAL in the Netherlands or Swish in Sweden, whereas US consumers prefer retailer apps. In America, younger consumers are especially attracted to “Buy Now, Pay Later” marketplaces, spending 1.5 to 2 times more than those who start on merchant websites. Rewards and offers are increasingly influencing payment decisions, with 25% of U.S. consumers citing rewards as a significant factor. This shows the increasing importance of digital wallets in everyday transactions. It opens up chances for payment providers to improve omnichannel loyalty programs and extend retail platforms. Furthermore, A2A payment formats may expand, particularly in the United States, where regulatory improvements could lower merchant costs.
Looking forward, Deloitte’s 2025 payment industry insights outlook revealed that consumers are turning to digital payments, with check transactions dropping as large stores adopt a “check zero” strategy to reduce costs and fraud concerns. Global e-commerce sales are expected to reach $6.3 trillion by 2024, fueling the growing use of credit cards, debit cards, and peer-to-peer payments. P2P app usage has gone up by 12% since 2021, but cash and check P2P payments have dropped. Digital payments are becoming more popular in B2B due to cost savings and technological developments, but checks continue to play an important role.

With 86% of revenues coming from the US, the bank is a clear beneficiary of the lower regulatory environment expected from the incoming administration. The company’s business is highly diversified across retail, commercial, wealth management, and investment banking, with significant scale across all verticals.
