Energy stocks have had a rough ride lately. With concerns mounting over a global recession, oil demand expectations are under pressure—and prices have reflected that sentiment. Among the sector’s big names,PetrobrasPBR has fallen more than 12% year to date, underperformingExxonMobilXOM andShell's SHEL 7.1% and 4.6% decline, respectively. While the entire sector has been challenged, Petrobras has drawn heightened investor scrutiny due to its state-controlled structure, macro headwinds, and currency risk. Despite these challenges, the stock shows both potential and risks, making it a mixed but interesting investment choice.

One of Petrobras’ brightest spots is its robust production outlook. The company’s 2025 roadmap outlines steady expansion via offshore development, including the highly productive Búzios field. With the launch of the Almirante FPSO—now pumping 800,000 barrels per day (bpd), compared to just 150,000 bpd at the prior top-producing field—Petrobras has clearly entered a new phase of operational scale, and with production forecasts continuing to rise over the next few years, the company is well positioned to benefit if oil prices stabilize or rebound, reinforcing its long-term investment appeal.
Despite these growth drivers, Petrobras is still priced at a steep discount. Its forward P/E ratio of just 3.64 stands far below ExxonMobil’s 13.14X and Shell’s 8X, offering a compelling valuation buffer for value-focused investors.

Meanwhile, its dividend yield north of 13.2% is strikingly higher than ExxonMobil’s 4% and Shell’s 4.8%. Even after a recent change in its payout policy, the dividend remains attractive and well-supported by strong cash flow, making it difficult for income-focused investors to overlook—especially in today’s uncertain market.

However, Petrobras’ tight link to global oil prices introduces volatility. The stock tends to move closely with oil prices, so a prolonged decline—possibly driven by an economic slowdown or rising trade tensions—could weigh heavily on its performance. Although the company operates efficiently, Q4 2024 results showed vulnerability, with adjusted EBITDA down nearly 47% year over year and net income hit by one-off costs and weaker production. While current oil price levels offer margin protection, they are far from guaranteed in a potentially recessionary climate.
Petrobras being controlled by the government is both a strength and a weakness. Government involvement can lead to decisions that focus more on national goals than on what’s best for shareholders. Frequent leadership changes and shifting policy directions only add to the uncertainty. Moreover, Petrobras’ exposure to the Brazilian real, which can be unpredictable, adds another layer of risk for international investors seeking dollar-denominated stability. These factors contribute to its consistently low valuation, despite operational strength.
Petrobras presents a classic high-risk, high-reward profile. On the one hand, its production scale, discounted valuation, and industry-leading dividend yield offer clear upside potential—especially compared to more expensive peers like ExxonMobil and Shell. On the other hand, political interference, currency swings, and global macro uncertainty complicate the picture. In this context, PBR stock appears fairly valued based on both the risks it faces and the opportunities it holds. While long-term investors may consider nibbling at current levels, the prudent stance for now is to rate Petrobras as a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
