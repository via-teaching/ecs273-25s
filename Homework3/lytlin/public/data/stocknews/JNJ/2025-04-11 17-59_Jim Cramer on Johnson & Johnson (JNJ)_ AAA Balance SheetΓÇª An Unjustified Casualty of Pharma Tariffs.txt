We recently published a list ofJim Cramer Questions Market Logic and Dissects These 7 Key Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.
In his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer unpacked the deepening uncertainty gripping both markets and politics as investors brace for higher inflation, elevated yields, and an unpredictable White House. With bond yields climbing and tariffs expanding across sectors, Cramer highlighted just how fragile investor conviction has become:
[talking about rising bond yields on 10Y treasuries] “You have a lot of people who say, you know what, I’ve got to revisit everything because of the inflationary nature. Maybe I have to buy them at 5-6%. Now, the reason I say that is because I think when the average person looks at the huge inflation that’s coming, they can’t think of a reason to buy bonds. And that’s where I’m stuck. Why would I buy that piece of paper? I mean, if the Japanese are selling that piece of paper and the Chinese are selling that piece of paper, why am I buying that piece of paper? And the answer is, I’m not. Let’s wait. A lot of things are ‘let’s wait’ in the bond market. In the stock market, there’s people taking action every minute on craziness.”

He also emphasized the sheer weight of presidential authority in shaping market sentiment, warning that Main Street rhetoric alone won’t shield investors from the fallout:
“The president is very powerful right now. Immensely powerful. More powerful than ever in my life. It would be amazing if the president said, you know what, we’re done for now. We’re done. But he came out and said, now it’s pharma’s turn. So as long as this keeps up, and he said he doesn’t care about Wall Street, he cares about Main Street. At a certain point, if you care about Main Street, then you do actually care about the 401k.”

Amid fears of broad-brush pharmaceutical tariffs, Jim Cramer defended Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) as an unjustified casualty in the market sell-off, pointing to its minimal import exposure and pristine balance sheet. Here’s his exact analysis:
“Well, we have a $350 billion company, J&J, a AAA balance sheet. The stock is down $5.30 on the president saying that we’re going to hit the pharmaceuticals. Now, once again, we’ve got the meat axe approach. J&J imports the least of the major pharma. Should they be down as much or more as the most? And what would happen if the president said, you know what, we’re going to start thinking making Commerce Department exceptions. We’re not going to hit U.S. companies as much as we’re going to hit foreign. Should AstraZeneca and J&J both be tariffed at the same price? Right now, we just make these decisions, and we don’t distinguish among companies because we almost seem to have a policy which is companies are unimportant. At what point do we say, you know what, this company is importing less and bringing things in.”
