Nvidia (NVDA) on Monday announced plans to build supercomputers entirely in the U.S., with the chipmaker and its partners set to invest up to $500 billion in American AI infrastructure over the next four years.
“The engines of the world’s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a release, adding "American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency.”
Nvidia said its supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas, being built in partnership with Foxconn and Wistron, are set to ramp production in the next 12 to 15 months.
The chipmaker said its Blackwell chips have already started production at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSM)facilities in Arizona.
