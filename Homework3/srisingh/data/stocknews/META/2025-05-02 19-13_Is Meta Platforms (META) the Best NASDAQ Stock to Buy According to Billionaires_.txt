We recently published a list of 10 Best NASDAQ Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other best NASDAQ stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The latest market data shows that the US economy contracted at an annualized rate of 0.3% during the first quarter of 2025. This was a rapid reversal from the 2.4% growth in the last quarter of 2024. The further segregation of the data shows that tariff uncertainty was one of the key contributing factors toward the slowdown, as net exports dropped 4.8%. According to a recent report by CNBC, traders highlighted that the imports were skewed up 41% last quarter as a preparatory move by companies to get ahead of the tariff situation. In this backdrop, the NASDAQ slipped another 0.09% on May 1, to end at 17,446.34.
On April 30, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee joined CNBC to talk about the outlook of the stock market amidst the tariff situation. He noted that the stock market is currently trying to figure out the trajectory of the economy as it is clear that the economic data for the next 3 quarters will be polluted by the tariffs and other distortions that follow. Lee highlighted that there are two questions that the market is trying to figure out. The first question is whether this is a dip and noise for 2025 only and the market exists in better shape as 2026 approaches. If this is the case then Lee believes that Equities have already made their lows with the S&P 500 at 4,835 on April 7. This will be the better-case scenario of all the possible outcomes. However, if the market feels that the uncertainty is dragging into a few more quarters in 2025 then that could be harmful for the stock market.
CNBC’s Steve Liesman added to Tom Lee’s comments by mentioning that the current stock market is the President’s market. He highlighted that when President Trump took charge the stock market rallied, however, the later policies hampered the sentiment and took the stock market down with it. Liseman further elaborated that before all these policy uncertainties the forecasts for GDP in 2025 were at 2% growth each quarter. However, now the first quarter ended up at -0.3% with an expectation of 1.6% growth next quarter. Liseman concluded that the market might see the economy bouncing back in the next quarter allowing investors to make sense of the outlook.
Amidst this uncertainty, Lee has emphasized the importance of staying invested in times of volatility to reap the benefits. We have covered more analysis from Tom Lee in 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires.
