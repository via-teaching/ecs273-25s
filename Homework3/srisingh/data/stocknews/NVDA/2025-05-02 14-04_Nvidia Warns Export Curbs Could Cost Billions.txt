Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) warned U.S. lawmakers that tightening export restrictions could inadvertently supercharge Huawei's AI chip ambitions, potentially redrawing the global semiconductor map.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.
At a closed-door session Thursday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other executives told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that fresh Commerce Department restrictions on exporting the company's H20 AI server chips to Chinanow subject to license requirements under a March directivecould cost Nvidia as much as $5.5 billion in potential sales this year, even as Huawei Technologies prepares to begin mass shipments of its own Ascend 910C processor next month and has quietly approached leading Chinese tech firms to field-test its forthcoming Ascend 910D flagship chip.
Those stakes are underscored by reported orders of at least $16 billion for Nvidia's H20 chips placed by Alibaba, Tencent and ByteDance in the first quarter of 2025, signaling robust demand for high-performance AI accelerators even as geopolitical tensions flare.
If DeepSeek R1 had been trained on Huawei chips or a future open-source Chinese model had been optimized exclusively for Huawei's architecture, that would risk creating a global market demand for Huawei chips, said a senior congressional committee staff member speaking to Reuters, capturing Capitol Hill's deep concern that U.S. export curbs could inadvertently fuel China's homegrown chip ecosystem at a critical juncture in the AI race.
Against that backdrop, lawmakers probed Huang on the long-term implications of diminished U.S. market share and pressed for insight into policy tweaks that might preserve America's edge in next-generation semiconductors without ceding ground to Beijing.
Nvidia spokesperson John Rizzo told Reuters that Jensen met with the House Foreign Affairs Committee to discuss the strategic importance of AI as national infrastructure and the need to invest in U.S. manufacturing, reiterating the company's full-throated support for government efforts to bolster American semiconductor leadership through both policy and capital investment.
In a March interview with the Financial Times, Huang had described Huawei as the single most formidable technology company in China, lamenting that U.S.-led restrictions have been done poorly even as the Chinese rival has clawed back smartphone market share and advanced its AI chip roadmap, and he committed to spending hundreds of billions of dollars on U.S.-made chips and electronics over the next four years as part of a broader push for onshore capacity under the CHIPS Act.
Investors should note that U.S. license requirements designed to hobble Huawei could backfire by accelerating demand for Chinese chips, potentially reshaping revenue projections for Nvidia and its peers. The outcome may hinge on how swiftly Washington can fine-tune export rules without undermining domestic champions in the global AI hardware war.
Investors will now watch Nvidia's early-June investor day and the Commerce Department's export license rulings for the next AI hardware catalyst.
