We have been listening for all of the tariff mentions on earnings calls this season. So, let's recap some of the latest that we are hearing. Big oil reported earnings this morning, and while we saw solid first quarter results, the energy sector is still facing headwinds from macroeconomic uncertainty. The Exxon CEO talking about tariffs on the earnings call saying, quote, "Coupled with the threats of increased OPEC supply, we are seeing significant downward pressure on prices and margins." Then there's Eaton, the power management company, also posting first quarter earnings today and it did post solid results on the top and bottom line, but it hasn't been immune to the tariff impact. Eaton COO opting not to address the specific amount of the tariff impact on the earnings call, saying, quote, "We decided not to disclose that number because we'll be wrong in a week's time." And then there's Apollo Global Management. That of course is the parent company of Yahoo. The company with approximately $785 billion of assets under management reported first quarter earnings this morning as well. And on the call, President Jim Zelter highlighting the broader impact of tariffs on the market, saying while the tariffs should not have come as a surprise, the scope and approach clearly rattled markets. We'll be on tariff watch again next week.
