ICONIC-LEAD is the first ever Phase 3 registrational study in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis to assess safety and efficacy of a systemic therapy in adolescents and adults simultaneously
84% of adolescents with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with investigational icotrokinra achieved clear or almost clear skin (IGA 0/1) at Week 16
SPRING HOUSE, Pa., April 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) today announced new icotrokinra (JNJ-2113) data from a subgroup analysis of ICONIC-LEADa, the first ever Phase 3 registrational study in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (PsO) to assess efficacy and safety of a systemic therapy in adolescents and adults simultaneously. These data, presented at the 2025 World Congress of Pediatric Dermatology (WCPD) Annual Meeting, show adolescents treated with once daily icotrokinra achieved higher rates of clear or almost clear skin at Week 16 compared to patients receiving placebo with no new safety signals identified.1 Icotrokinra is a first-in-class investigational targeted oral peptide that selectively blocks the IL-23 receptor and is being studied in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe plaque PsO.
In the study, 84.1% of adolescent patients treated with once daily icotrokinra achieved an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA)b score of 0/1 (clear or almost clear skin) and 70.5% achieved a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)c 90 response, compared to 27.3% and 13.6% receiving placebo, respectively, at Week 16.1
Response rates continued to improve through Week 24 where 86.4% of adolescents achieved IGA 0/1 (clear or almost clear skin) and 88.6% achieved PASI 90.1 Further, at Week 24, 75% of adolescents achieved IGA 0 (completely clear skin) and 63.6% achieved PASI 100.1
"Data from the Phase 3 ICONIC LEAD subgroup analysis demonstrate impressive efficacy rates, showing the promise of this novel therapeutic option in the treatment of adolescents with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who've often not yet received an advanced therapy," said Lawrence Eichenfield, M.D., Chief of Pediatric and Adolescent Dermatology at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego, and Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine (Dermatology), at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine, ICONIC-LEAD presenter.d "Young patients with plaque psoriasis face unique challenges due to the visible and uncomfortable nature of the disease, making effective treatment options that align with their needs and preferences all the more important."
Icotrokinra demonstrated a favorable safety profile. At Week 16, 50% of adolescents treated with icotrokinra experienced ≥1 adverse event (AE), compared to 73% of adolescents receiving placebo, with no new safety signals identified.1
"Adolescents living with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis shouldn't have to wait for effective treatments options that have the potential to deliver completely clear skin, which is the driving force for studying this younger population as part of the pivotal ICONIC program," said Liza O'Dowd, Vice President, Immunodermatology Disease Area Lead, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. "These data underscore the promise of next-generation therapies and the potential for icotrokinra to offer adolescents with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis the unique combination of a favorable safety profile and complete skin clearance in a once-daily pill."
Editor's notes:
a. ICONIC-LEAD is a Phase 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the efficacy and safety of icotrokinra compared with placebo in 684 participants (icotrokinra=456; placebo=228) 12 years of age or older with moderate-to-severe plaque PsO, with the higher efficacy bar of PASI 90 and IGA score of 0/1 with at least a 2-grade improvement as co-primary endpoints. ICONIC-LEAD enrolled 66 adolescent patients.
b. The IGA is a five-point scale with a severity score ranging from 0 to 4, where 0 indicates clear, 1 is minimal, 2 is mild, 3 is moderate, and 4 indicates severe disease.2
c. The PASI score grades the amount of surface area on each body region that is covered by psoriasis plaques and the severity of plaques for their redness, thickness and scaliness.3 PASI 90 corresponds to an improvement of >=90% in PASI score from baseline.3
d. Dr. Lawrence Eichenfield is a paid consultant for Johnson & Johnson. He has not been compensated for any media work.
About the ICONIC Clinical Development ProgramThe pivotal Phase 3 ICONIC clinical development program of icotrokinra (JNJ-2113) in adult and adolescent individuals with moderate-to-severe plaque PsO was initiated with two studies in Q4 2023 – ICONIC-LEAD and ICONIC-TOTAL – pursuant to the license and collaboration agreement between Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc. and Janssen Biotech, Inc., a Johnson & Johson company.4
ICONIC-LEAD (NCT06095115) is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotrokinra compared with placebo in participants with moderate-to-severe plaque PsO, with PASI 90 and IGA score of 0 or 1 with at least a 2-grade improvement as co-primary endpoints.5
ICONIC-TOTAL (NCT06095102) is a RCT to evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotrokinra compared with placebo for the treatment of PsO in participants with at least moderate severity affecting special areas (e.g., scalp, genital, and/or hands and feet) with overall IGA score of 0 or 1 with at least a 2-grade improvement as the primary endpoint.6
Other Phase 3 studies in the development program include ICONIC-ADVANCE 1 (NCT06143878) and ICONIC-ADVANCE 2 (NCT06220604), which are evaluating the efficacy and safety of icotrokinra compared with both placebo and deucravacitinib in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque PsO.7,8 ICONIC-ASCEND will evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotrokinra compared with placebo and ustekinumab in participants with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. ICONIC-PsA 1 (NCT06878404) and ICONIC-PsA 2 (NCT06807424) will evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotrokinra compared to placebo in participants with active psoriatic arthritis. will evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotrokinra compared to placebo in participants with active psoriatic arthritis.
About Plaque PsoriasisPlaque psoriasis (PsO) is a chronic immune-mediated disease resulting in overproduction of skin cells, which causes inflamed, scaly plaques that may be itchy or painful.9 It is estimated that 8 million Americans and more than 125 million people worldwide live with the disease.10 Nearly one-quarter of all people with plaque PsO have cases that are considered moderate to severe.11 On Caucasian skin, plaques typically appear as raised, red patches covered with a silvery white buildup of dead skin cells or scale.11 On skin of color, the plaques may appear darker and thicker and more of a purple, gray or dark brown color.12 Plaques can appear anywhere on the body, although they most often appear on the scalp, knees, elbows, and torso.12 Living with plaque PsO can be a challenge and impact life beyond a person's physical health, including emotional health, relationships, and handling the stressors of life.12 Psoriasis on highly visible areas of the body or sensitive skin, such as the scalp, hands, feet, and genitals, can have an increased negative impact on quality of life.12,13
About Icotrokinra (JNJ-77242113, JNJ-2113)Investigational icotrokinra is the first targeted oral peptide designed to selectively block the IL-23 receptor,14 which underpins the inflammatory response in moderate-to-severe plaque PsO, ulcerative colitis and offers potential in other IL-23-mediated diseases.15,16 Icotrokinra binds to the IL-23 receptor with single-digit picomolar affinity and demonstrated potent, selective inhibition of IL-23 signaling in human T cells.17 The license and collaboration agreement established between Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc. and Janssen Biotech, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company, in 2017 enabled the companies to work together to discover and develop next-generation compounds that ultimately led to icotrokinra.18
Icotrokinra was jointly discovered and is being developed pursuant to the license and collaboration agreement between Protagonist and Johnson & Johnson. Johnson & Johnson retains exclusive worldwide rights to develop icotrokinra in Phase 2 clinical trials and beyond, and to commercialize compounds derived from the research conducted pursuant to the agreement against a broad range of indications.19,20,21
Icotrokinra is being studied in the pivotal Phase 3 ICONIC clinical development program in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis and the Phase 2b ANTHEM-UC study in moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.

The worldwide ripple effects from President Donald Trump’s tariffs have been so widespread that one analyst says some in the business world fear the issue may go beyond Trump simply taking a political stand.  Thomas Lee, a managing partner and the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, sent a memo Wednesday that painted a picture of the fallout from the president’s trade war.  Lee wrote that he has had “many conversations” with macro fund managers who are expressing  concern that those in the White House aren’t acting rationally — and who worry the tariffs go beyond politics and policy.
