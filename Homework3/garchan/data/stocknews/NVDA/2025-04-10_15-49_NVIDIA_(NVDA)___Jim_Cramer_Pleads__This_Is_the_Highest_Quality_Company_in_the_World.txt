We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Calls Market Decline ‘Man-Made’ and Breaks Down 15 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.
On Monday, April 7th, Jim Cramer opened the Mad Money episode with a message of calm in the midst of chaos. After nine straight lower openings and another bruising session for stocks, Cramer made it clear that while the pain is real. He acknowledged the likelihood of a recession but rejected the notion that we were on the brink of another global financial collapse, saying:
“Do we have a problem that’s systemic meaning there’s actual weakness in our a rot in our institutions that can’t easily be undone? Now my partner David Faber and I discussed this very point this morning and we agreed that we needed to take the financial crisis scenario off the table because our institutions are strong, and we don’t believe that the whole economic system is in jeopardy. We don’t believe that major banks will fail, we definitely don’t like this situation for heaven’s sake. It’s likely we’re headed for a recession because of the president’s ill-advised plans, but we’ll pull out of it one way or another. It’s not going to be the global financial crisis number two.”

Rather than being caused by inflation, interest rates, or even earnings weakness, Cramer insisted the market’s decline was driven by leadership decisions. He called the downturn “man-made,” emphasizing that it could be reversed just as easily as it began, if the administration changed course:
“Then we get back to the approximate cause of the decline: it’s all man-made! Wall Street’s terrified by the tariffs but we have an arbitrary material president who can declare victory, roll these tariffs back with the stroke of [inaudible] and then where would we be? We would have bought nothing. And at some point, the White House won’t be able to tolerate a crashing stock market.”
What concerned Cramer most was the deeper agenda behind the tariffs. In his view, the administration wasn’t just trying to rebalance trade but to reverse decades of globalization, forcing companies to return manufacturing to U.S. soil — even if that meant permanent economic disruption.
“The job isn’t just to coerce China; it’s to cause US manufacturers to come back here. Away from Vietnam, that’s why Vietnam had that huge tariff. Those are two agenda items that not just one that’s important it means there’s no possible negotiation because that would encourage companies not to come back here. Sure, the tariffs could raise some revenue or promote domestic manufacturing, but they can’t reverse history, and Trump wants to reverse history. It’s a tall order – an ill-advised one – he wants to do it quickly.”
Finally, Cramer laid out the daunting checklist of what would need to happen for the current strategy to succeed:
“There are many things that have to go right for Trump to successfully reorder the global economy in order to bring back domestic manufacturing and bring China to its knees. First the high tariffs can’t cause a spike in inflation or else the Fed won’t be able to bail us out with rate cuts. Second, he has to negotiate new trade deals very quickly for congressional members who are supposed to control the tariffs wake up. The lower the market goes the more likely the Republicans in Congress actually throw the president’s agenda under the bus. Third, he has to do it without causing a big spike in unemployment. I think if he does get all three, he isn’t going to press his bet with these tariffs, instead, he’ll find some reason to declare victory and roll them back. which is why the market didn’t collapse today.”
For this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 7. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.

Cramer discussed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the context of its recent selloff, noting how investor sentiment toward AI stocks has reversed sharply. He categorized Nvidia in his “second tier” of the Magnificent 7 stocks. However, he defended NVIDIA’s long-term value and financial strength, saying:
“NVIDIA is down 36% from its highs. Just 3 weeks ago for instance, that Nvidia GTC event occurred where there was no sign at all that this AI theme was slowing but investors want to throw in the towel so there’s just been a freight train of selling in anything AI. Maybe you just have to step back and let the selling play out for Nvidia. Let me give you some good news, it sells for just 21 times this year’s earnings. This is the highest quality company in the world. It’s also less than half its average valuation over the past 5 years; that’s cold comfort. I think the stock will fly.”
RiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:
“NVDA was a top contributor in the fourth quarter following blowout 1Q results and guidance driven by strong data center sales (+427% year-over-year). The company reported revenue of $26 billion, up 262% year-over-year, and EPS of $6.12, up 462% year-over-year and 9% ahead of expectations. Revenue guidance for 2Q of $28 billion was 5% above very high expectations. The artificial intelligence arms race, kicked off by ChatGPT and Alphabet’s Bard, among others, has generated tremendous demand for Nvidia’s next generation graphic processors.
Overall, NVDA ranks 8th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

The rise in yields was prompted by news that U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on certain tariffs for most countries, even as he raised tariffs on China to 125%.  "Despite the calming winds, implied volatility in fixed income markets will likely remain elevated as the administration's next move remains very unpredictable," Danske Bank Research's Frederik Romedahl said in a note.  The two-year Treasury yield was 5.5 basis points lower at 3.893%, the 10-year Treasury yield was down 11 basis points at 4.287%, and the 30-year Treasury yield was 10 basis points lower at 4.693%, according to Tradeweb data.
