With the company's shares now trading at just 16.3 times 2028 projected earnings in response to Microsoft's slowing data center construction and America's newly implemented reciprocal tariffs, this historically cheap valuation may represent a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity for patient investors.  While investors worry about spending slowdowns in AI, Nvidia continues cementing strategic partnerships that expand its already vast technological moat.
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Janus Henderson, which manages $379 billion in assets, is advising investors to cut stock holdings and buy more investment-grade sovereign bonds as tariffs threaten to slow global growth, a fund manager said.

His base case is for a market selloff and the potential for bearish and recessionary cases to take hold.
The expanded partnership focuses on delivering solutions across agentic AI, networking, and mainframe modernisation.
