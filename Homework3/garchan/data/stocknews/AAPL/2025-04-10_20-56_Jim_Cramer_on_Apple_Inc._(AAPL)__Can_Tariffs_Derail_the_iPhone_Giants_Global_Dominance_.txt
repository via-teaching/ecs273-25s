We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Says Tariff Pain Isn’t Over Yet And Reviews These 9 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.
In his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer dissected the market’s recent rally and reminded his viewers to not mistake short-term optimism for resolution. As major indices bounced earlier in the day, Cramer warned that some deeper structural uncertainties remain unresolved, saying:
“Well, I think that those who are running companies are saying, what the heck is going on here? We’re trying to run our companies. Suddenly, we find that a country that we’ve dealt with for a long time, we have to just say, wait a second, we’re going to put a surcharge on. We’re going to pass through. So the issue is, who can pass through and who isn’t? Who has pricing power? It’s often like that. Who has scale? Who has pricing power? Who can tell the Chinese, listen, we’re going to go away, of which then you have out-of-stock parts. And who says, OK, we’ll split the tariff.

Cramer acknowledged the bullish hopes circulating among traders and policymakers that quick deals with allies like Japan, Mexico, and Canada could offset the trade war’s damage. But he was clear that these deals, while politically useful, won’t erase the inflationary burden already being felt by companies and consumers:
“[Talking about expectations about the White House reaching deals with other countries] There’s going to be a deal. They’re very excited about Japan and the administration. Exactly. They’re very excited. By the way, they like Korea. […] Yeah, I think that Mexico, they are very much expecting it’s going to be a better deal. Canada, and they’re going to be able to trumpet a few days from now. Look what we’ve done by being really tough. And you know what? The Chinese are going to fold. They believe that the Chinese will fold.”
At the heart of Cramer’s analysis was a question he believes investors need to ask themselves:
“So, then the question becomes at a certain point, do you believe in everything else about President Trump that you’re willing to overlook the inflationary aspects? Do you believe the social aspects, are they so important to you? Do you believe the commitment he’s made to try to cut the budget deficit? Do you believe President Trump just decided, I’m not going to focus on the inflation? Because that’s really been unusual to not focus on inflation.”
To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on April 8th.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) found itself at the center of the tariff discussion during the show, as Cramer and his co-hosts questioned how much cost pressure the company and its partners could absorb before consumers began to push back. Here are Cramer’s remarks:
“So if you’re Apple, and I know Craig Moffett is a little too negative. I think about Apple for Moffitt days. Yes. He’s saying, okay, so the tariffs are going to be eaten by some by Verizon on the phone, some by T-Mobile, some by AT&T. Some by the carriers and then some by the customers. So therefore, do their sales drop versus Samsung? Or is the universe of people who use it, it’s not fungible? And then the other thing is that this move by Apple to move to India, that won’t cut it with President Trump. President Trump wants them to build a wall. […] And that’s why the research is so heavily negative on Apple today. I think Apple has said, listen, we’ll put $500 billion, maybe more, into our country. And I don’t think the President believes that. […] There’s three underweights of Apple today, and they are all saying, get out now.”
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks that Jim Cramer recently went over during a segment on his Mad Money program. Here are his latest remarks:
“Boy I don’t know… These tariffs are going to be a killer. According to an analysis at the Wall Street Journal, Trump’s tariffs will take the cost of an iPhone 16 Pro from 550 to around 850, and that’s not counting the new tariffs he threatened to unleash on China today. I think the real costs are lower because of Apple’s manufacturing shift to India, but even if it only goes up by half that amount, it’s still a huge increase, although hopefully the companies will eat a chunk of it. […]

With the tariff situation spiraling over the past few days, it’s been almost impossible to establish a clear stance in the stock markets. The extreme volatility has made every trade feel unpredictable, with positive and negative news about global equities swinging wildly in both directions. But amid all this chaos, Apple’s (AAPL) stock has erased its gains from the past twelve months. That’s pretty unusual for a stock of Apple’s size and stability.
