Meta will argue that an increase in traffic to Instagram and Facebook during TikTok's brief shutdown in the United States in January shows direct competition.The FTC claims that Meta holds a monopoly on platforms used to share content with friends and family, where its main competitors in the United States are Snap's Snapchat and MeWe, a tiny privacy-focused social media app launched in 2016.Platforms where users broadcast content to strangers based on shared interests, such as X, TikTok, YouTube and Reddit, are not interchangeable, the FTC has argued.U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said in a ruling in November that the FTC "faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial."The trial could stretch into July. If the FTC wins, it would have to separately prove that measures such as forcing Meta to sell Instagram or WhatsApp would restore competition.Losing Instagram in particular could prove catastrophic to Meta's bottom line.While Meta does not release app-specific revenue figures, advertising research firm Emarketer forecast in December that Instagram would generate $37.13 billion this year, a little over half of Meta's U.S. ad revenue.Instagram also generates more revenue per user than any other social platform, including Facebook, according to Emarketer.WhatsApp to date has contributed only a sliver to Meta's total revenue, but it is the company's biggest app in terms of daily users and is ramping up efforts to earn money off tools like chatbots. Zuckerberg has said that such "business messaging" services are likely to drive the company's next wave of growth.TRUMP VS. BIG TECHThe case is part of a crackdown on Big Tech started during Trump's first administration.Meta has been making regular overtures to Trump since his election, nixing content moderation policies Republicans said amounted to censorship and donating $1 million to Trump's inauguration. Zuckerberg has also visited the White House multiple times in recent weeks.Amazon, Apple and Alphabet's Google also face antitrust lawsuits by U.S. enforcers.Several major tech companies have moved to align with Trump since the election, such as by rolling back diversity initiatives and having executives engage directly with the White House.While a shift from the combative tone the companies took during Trump's first term, it has not resulted in a pullback on the antitrust cases.(Reporting by Jody Godoy in Washington and Katie Paul in New York; Editing by Mark Porter)Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand on Monday in a historic antitrust trial that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.  The Federal Trade Commission called Zuckerberg as its first witness, as it seeks to prove that Meta acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to preserve its monopoly in the social networking space.  In opening statements, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson said Meta has used its position to generate enormous profits even as consumer satisfaction has dropped.Meta is preparing for the start of a courtroom battle Monday with the US government in an antitrust case that could force Mark Zuckerberg to break up his $1.3 trillion empire and sell one of its crown jewels: Instagram.It used to be that once you worked for 30 years at the same company and were ready to retire, you would simply punch out and collect your pension.
