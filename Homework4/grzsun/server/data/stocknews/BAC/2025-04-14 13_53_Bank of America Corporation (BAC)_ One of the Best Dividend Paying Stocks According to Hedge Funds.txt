In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stands against other best dividend-paying stocks.Dividend-paying stocks have consistently attracted investor interest due to their long-term value. CNBC highlights this by examining the historical performance of the broader market. Between 1960 and 2024, a $10,000 investment in the index would have grown to over $982,000 purely from stock price appreciation, based on data from FactSet and NYU Stern. However, many companies in the index also returned capital to shareholders through dividends. Had an investor reinvested those dividends over the years, the investment would have ballooned to approximately $6.42 million by the beginning of 2025.This outlook seems reasonable, especially when considering how crucial cash flow has become in today’s economic environment. Investors continue to favor income-generating assets, and dividends remain one of the most reliable ways to deliver that income. Reflecting this trend, several companies within the market have recently introduced dividend payments.According to S&P Global, companies in the S&P index now contribute roughly 85% of the total dividends paid across the market—up from 82% in 2024. This increase includes 2.7% of the total dividend pool coming from firms that only recently began issuing dividends. The top 29 companies in the index alone are responsible for 40% of all dividends paid by the index’s constituents and 35% of the total dividends across the entire US equity market. Under the current base-case forecast, these leading firms are expected to distribute a combined $280 billion in dividends. In a more optimistic (upside) scenario, that figure could climb by 2.75% to $288 billion, with major large cap companies projected to deliver the most significant gains by weighted average. If the most favorable (bull-case) conditions materialize, these 29 companies could boost total dividend payouts by an estimated 4.5%, contributing an additional 1% themselves.It’s no surprise, then, that dividends have become a central theme in many investors’ strategies. According to Brian Bollinger, founder of Simply Safe Dividends, focusing on companies that regularly pay dividends can offer a sense of reassurance. He further noted that younger investors, in particular, have the opportunity to build long-term dividend growth portfolios aimed at maximizing total return and capital appreciation over time.According to Nuveen, companies that focus on dividend growth tend to possess strong long-term fundamentals and may deliver relatively attractive performance in the year ahead. Historically, firms that consistently increased or initiated dividend payments have produced higher annualized returns and exhibited lower volatility compared to the broader equity market. While such companies may not lead in every market environment, their favorable risk-adjusted returns over extended periods make them a solid foundation for equity portfolios.Nuveen also suggested that many firms remain in a strong position to continue raising dividends over time. In the US, corporate balance sheets are generally healthy, consumer spending remains steady, and earnings growth is projected to pick up pace in 2025. Data from FactSet shows that dividends per share for the S&P index rose by 7.6% in 2024, with consensus forecasts pointing to a further 4.2% increase in 2025. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.A professional banker providing consultation to a customer in the security of his office.Our Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of the close of Q4 2024.
