Pfizer said that data from the trial will still be submitted to the scientific community for further study.Pfizer was developing danuglipron, an oral GLP-1 drug, as something of a rival to Ozempic and Wegovy, both of which are manufactured by Denmark-based Novo Nordisk (NVO). Early trials had shown that Pfizer’s pill resulted in about as much weight loss as Wegovy.An oral weight-loss medication would be far less invasive than the injections required by most GLP-1s. Like Pfizer, pharma giants including Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly (LLY), and AstraZeneca (AZN) are working on their own oral weight-loss pills. Viking Therapeutics (VKTX), a San Diego-based pharma company, has also shown promising results in early trials.Despite the setback, Pfizer’s stock was up 0.9% Monday morning. Eli Lilly rose 1.6%, and Novo Nordisk rose 2.5%.For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.The drugmaker said one patient became ill after being treated with its experimental weight-loss drug, danuglipron.↗️ Goldman Sachs (GS): The Wall Street bank posted better-than-expected results, boosted by a surge in equities trading in the first quarter, which ended just before President Trump's sweeping tariffs disrupted markets.Wall Street analysts said the results for Verve’s therapy appeared competitive on efficacy, while avoiding any major safety concerns — at least so far.Pfizer bows, but is not entirely out of the GLP-1 race.President Trump said Monday that he is going to impose new tariffs on pharmaceuticals soon.  “Pharmaceuticals we’re going to do,” he said.
