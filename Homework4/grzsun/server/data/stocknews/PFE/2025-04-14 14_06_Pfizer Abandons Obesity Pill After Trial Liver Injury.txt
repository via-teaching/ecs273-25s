The company won't advance the once-daily medicine into the final stage of testing and will instead invest in earlier-stage treatments for obesity. Damian Garde reports on Bloomberg Television.Pfizer  is halting development of its experimental weight-loss pill, as the booming obesity drug market remains out of reach for the drug giant.  The company said Monday the stoppage comes after it reviewed clinical data and a study subject developed a liver injury that might have been caused by the drug, called danuglipron.  Halting the drug’s development means  Pfizer  still is unable to get a cut, for now, of the white-hot obesity market, which analysts say could reach $100 billion by the end of the decade.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told ABC News the upcoming tariffs for electronics are based on Section 232, which allows President Trump to adjust imports that pose a threat to national security.1014 ET – The danuglipron setback has pushed Pfizer to the sidelines in the booming obesity market, but Viking Therapeutics’ VK2735 could get the drugmaker back in the game, say analysts at William Blair.  In a note, Andy Hsieh and Alexandra Ramsey say VK2735, in development as a pill and as an injection, could offer Pfizer a rare opportunity to reestablish not only a mere presence in obesity, but also a leading position beyond the current Novo Nordisk/Eli Lilly duopoly.  With shares down significantly over the past six months, Viking sports a market cap of around $2.5 billion, but William Blair sees a fair value of $9.2 billion, or about $82 a share.Viking Therapeutics stock rocketed Monday after Pfizer said it's scrapping development of its daily weight-loss pill.AON announces a hike in the quarterly cash dividend to 74.5 cents per share.Apple (AAPL) stock surged 4.5% in Monday afternoon trading after U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced a temporary exemption for smartphones, laptops, and other electronics from President Donald Trump’s newly imposed 145% reciprocal tariffs on Chinese goods.We recently published a list of 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar.
