# Homework 4

This folder contains two parts, client and server. This repository contains my solution to Homework 4, which extends Homework 3 into a complete full-stack web application using FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend).

## Folder Structure
```

## Server

For the server part, make sure you have the respective packages installed.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Secondly, make sure you have already installed and started your mongoDB local server.
For example, for mongodb managed with homebrew, run:

```
brew services start mongodb-community
```

Then, put your data into database with:

```
python import_data.py
```

Finally, start your api server by,

```
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## Backend Setup

### Step 1: Navigate to server folder
```
cd server
```

### Step 2: Step 2: (Optional but recommended) Create virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
### Step 3: Install backend dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 4: Start local MongoDB server
If using Homebrew (macOS): 
```
brew services start mongodb-community
```

### Step 5: Import your data into MongoDB
Before running this step, ensure your data is inside server/data/ using the structure specified.

```
python import_data.py
```

### Step 6: Start the FastAPI server
```
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```
API base: http://localhost:8000
Swagger docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Client

For the client part, it should mostly the same as your Homework 4. The only difference in this template is the data fetching part, as the example shown in `App.tsx`, that fetch the data for the drop-down menu with 20 different stocks. You can easily transfer that part into `js` version if needed.

```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Notes
Replace test data in server/data/ with your own data from HW1 and HW2.

The dropdown in the UI fetches data from your API server—this is the main connection between front-end and back-end.

All news articles are stored in a single MongoDB collection, indexed by a stock field for efficient querying.

Follow the exact folder structure provided in the assignment.

I reused the same pull request link that was created for Homework 3 and updated it with my Homework 4 submission.
