Furthermore, the 10% tariff on goods imported from other countries has been waived off for these products.Despite the possibility of a new, lower sectoral tariff being imposed on goods containing semiconductors, and a 20% tariff on China still in place, this development signifies a major triumph for Apple and the consumer electronics industry that is heavily dependent on China for production, reports Bloomberg.Don’t Miss:‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.Amit Daryanani, an analyst at Evercore ISI, expressed his relief for Apple in a note on Saturday, stating, “The tariffs would have driven material cost inflation.” He predicts a surge in Apple’s shares on Monday following an 11% plunge this month.Prior to the recent exemption, Apple had devised a plan to shift its supply chain to manufacture more US-bound iPhones in India, which would have been subject to much lower levies.This strategy was viewed as a short-term solution to evade the high China tariff and avert significant price increases.Nevertheless, uncertainty prevails as White House policies are prone to change, and Apple may need to implement more drastic alterations. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce has described the move as “a small step by the US toward correcting its wrongful action of unilateral ‘reciprocal tariffs’,” and has called on the US to completely rescind the action.See Also:Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing —this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share.Howard Lutnick, the US Commerce Secretary, indicated on ABC outlet that the late Friday reprieve was temporary, and reiterated Trump's plan to apply a different, specific levy to the sector.Why It Matters:The tariff exemption is a significant development for Apple, which heavily relies on China for manufacturing its products. The move could potentially save the company from significant cost inflation, as noted by Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani.However, the uncertainty surrounding White House policies and the temporary nature of the reprieve means that Apple may still need to consider alternative strategies, such as shifting more of its manufacturing to countries like India.The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China also add an element of unpredictability to the situation.Read Next:How do billionaires pay less in income tax than you?Tax deferring is their number one strategy.If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?Image: ShutterstockSend To MSN:  Send to MSNUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.Click now to access unique insightsthat can set you ahead in today's competitive market.Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?This articleApple Escapes Supply Chain Crisis As Trump Excludes Popular Electronics From Tariffsoriginally appeared onBenzinga.com© 2025 Benzinga.com.
