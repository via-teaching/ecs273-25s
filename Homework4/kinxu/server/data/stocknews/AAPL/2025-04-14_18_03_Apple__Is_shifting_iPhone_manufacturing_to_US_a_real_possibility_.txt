Officials signaled that electronics, semiconductors, and solar cells may still be included in upcoming sector-specific tariffs.BofA refreshed its tariff impact analysis for Apple, assuming a 20% tariff on Chinese-made electronics and no tariffs on Indian exports.Under this scenario, the hit to Apple’s earnings per share in calendar 2026 could be about $0.41, or a 4.9% drop, if the company absorbs all costs and keeps prices unchanged. That compares to a previously estimated 36.6% earnings hit under steeper tariffs.If Apple were to raise U.S. prices by around 10%, the EPS impact would shrink to just $0.11, or 1.2%, even accounting for a projected 5% drop in units sold, the bank said.Apple is already producing some iPhones in India, with about 15 million units expected to be exported to the U.S. tariff-free.However, the remaining 35 million iPhones as well as all iPads and Macs sold in the U.S. would face the 20% tariff if they continue to be made in China.While the risk of a broader trade war still looms, BofA noted Apple could take several steps to soften the blow, such as raising prices, adjusting supply chains, lobbying for exceptions, or slowing its product release cycle.As for shifting iPhone manufacturing to the U.S., BofA estimates it would cost about 25% more than producing in China, mostly due to higher labor costs. But increased automation and less frequent product launches could reduce that burden over timeDespite the uncertainty, BofA reiterated its Buy rating on Apple, citing resilient margins, strong cash flows, and steady capital returns. The price objective remains $250.Related articlesHSBC Sees Slower India Rate Hikes by Year-End on Growth WorriesPakistan’s Budget Isn’t Enough to Unlock IMF Loan, Citi SaysGlobal Selloff Deepens as Stocks, Bonds, Yen Slump: Markets WrapApple didn’t wait around for tariff certainty from the Trump administration to get ahead of the potential hit.
