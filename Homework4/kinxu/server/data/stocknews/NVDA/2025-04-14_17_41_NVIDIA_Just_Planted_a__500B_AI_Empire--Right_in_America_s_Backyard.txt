In a move that could redefine the global AI landscape, the chip giant is shifting its manufacturing base to the U.S., partnering with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Foxconn (FXCOF), Wistron, Amkor, and SPIL to produce its Blackwell AI chips and supercomputers. The company has already secured over a million square feet of manufacturing space in Arizona and Texas, with production set to scale aggressively over the next 1215 months. For the first time ever, the full stack of NVIDIA's AI infrastructurefrom chipmaking to packagingis being built entirely in the U.S., with a moonshot goal: half a trillion dollars' worth of AI systems in just four years.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.CEO Jensen Huang is not just hedging against geopolitical riskhe's engineering a whole new AI supply chain. After reportedly dodging export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chip by promising more domestic investment, NVIDIA now finds itself at the center of America's AI push. Huang called it the engine of the world's AI infrastructureand he's backing that up with deep investments in robotics, automation, and digital twins to future-proof operations. The company says the U.S. expansion could generate hundreds of thousands of jobs and unlock trillions in economic value over the long term.But this isn't just about headlines and hype. The real challenge lies in execution. Trade tensions with China could disrupt material supplies, and America's chronic shortage of skilled chip workers could bottleneck growth. Still, if Huang pulls this off, NVIDIA won't just be leading the AI raceit'll be rebuilding America's industrial backbone in the process. Investors betting on long-term AI infrastructure?

Risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies plummeted on fears of an abrupt slowdown in the global economy, but the president has now placed a 90-day pause on some of the reciprocal tariffs, which has stabilized the markets.  Digital products, services, and assets were mostly exempt from the tariffs, which meant cryptocurrencies were fundamentally unaffected.Nvidia said it is planning to build AI servers worth as much as $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years with help from partners such as TSMC, the latest American tech firm to back the Trump administration's push for local manufacturing.  Monday's announcement includes production of its Blackwell AI chips at TSMC's factory at Phoenix, Arizona and supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas by Foxconn and Wistron that are expected to ramp up in 12 to 15 months.  The move aligns the AI chip giant, majority of whose processors are made in Taiwan, with a clutch of tech firms that have pledged to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. amid threats of steep tariffs from President Donald Trump.Retiring on a fixed income can seem daunting, but with some planning and commitment to a frugal lifestyle, it's possible to retire comfortably on $2,000 a month.
