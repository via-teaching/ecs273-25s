While Treasuries and stocks rallied on news that President Donald Trump will delay levies on some popular consumer electronics, sentiment on the dollar was undermined by his warnings that the exemption will prove temporary.Protracted selloffs in the greenback and Treasuries — typically seen as havens in turbulent times — have exacerbated concerns that investors are lightening up on US assets in the face of tectonic trade policy shifts and broader political uncertainty.Listen to the Here’s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.Weakness in the dollar and Treasuries is a “horrible, toxic combination,” said Jordan Rochester, head of macro strategy for EMEA at Mizuho International Plc., in an interview on Bloomberg Television.The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index finished Monday down 0.3%. The gauge has fallen about 6.1% so far this year, on track for its biggest annual loss since 2017.Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade.

An index measuring three-month risk reversals — or the spread between call and put options — on the dollar against its major peers has dropped to a five-year low.That indicates greater demand for put options that would benefit from a weaker dollar than for call options that would gain from a stronger one.The S&P 500 index gained 0.8% on Monday. The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell 11 basis points to 4.38%. A five-day bond market selloff unleashed by anxiety over Trump’s trade war sent 10-year Treasury yields to the biggest weekly surge in over two decades last week.Lasting damage?The discussion that has dominated Wall Street for much of the past week has centered on whether Trump’s actions, even if they are eventually reversed, have inflicted lasting damage to the idea that the US dollar and Treasuries are the ultimate risk-free assets.“We are talking about a regime change in the way the market views the dollar, particularly during times of global financial stress,” Steve Barrow, a strategist at Standard Bank, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. “We’d note that the other key component of the US’s safe-asset allure – the Treasury market – has not been particularly safe.”That view was echoed by Derek Halpenny, head of global markets research at MUFG Bank, who focused on weekend remarks from Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stressing a longstanding plan to apply a different, specific levy to the technology sector.“It is difficult to see any fundamental factor that will likely improve investor sentiment,” Halpenny wrote in a report. “Key levels were broken last week for the dollar.”One-week risk reversals on the Bloomberg dollar index moved toward parity for the first time in five days, a sign that traders are becoming less bearish on the greenback. Still, the gauge has remained in negative territory for a third straight day, with bearish sentiment toward the US currency at levels unseen since the pandemic.“Trump’s actions have persistently damaged the ‘US brand’,” wrote Dana Malas, a strategist at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB. “This means that dollar assets, both inside and outside the US, should continue to carry higher risk premiums.”Almost 80% of respondents to a Bloomberg survey predicted the dollar would weaken further over the next month, the biggest proportion of bears since the surveys began in 2022.Strategists at the biggest Wall Street banks also see the potential for further weakness.JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts suggested investors remain bearish the dollar, especially against the yen and euro, as there’s still a chance of a US recession. Mizuho Bank Ltd. anticipates the US currency may fall another 5% on a trade-weighted basis before rebounding, based on how it traded in 2017-18 and during the pandemic.“The design and implementation of these tariffs should have a negative impact on the currency because they have contributed to eroding consumer and business confidence,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Kamakshya Trivedi wrote.“If tariffs weigh on US firms’ profit margins and US consumers’ real incomes, like we think they will, they can erode that exceptionalism and, in turn, crack the central pillar of the strong dollar,” they said.--With assistance from Michael G.

Who will catch any tax cheats after U.S. President Donald Trump gutted the Internal Revenue Service is another question, but a relief rally limped along in Asian markets after Trump suggested he might grant exemptions on auto-related tariffs.

Bank trading desks have been collecting more fees from investors scrambling to reduce or dial up the risk in their portfolios on any new clue about how  President Trump’s  tariffs might ultimately play out.

Apple and other technology companies helped lift Wall Street after Trump said he was exempting smartphones, computers and other electronics from some of his stiff tariffs, which could ultimately more than double prices for U.S. customers of products coming from China.  Automakers also rallied after Trump suggested he may announce pauses on tariffs next for the auto industry.Right now, stocks are trading up — so it looks like investors think the tech tariffs are at least being pushed off into the future or maybe won’t happen at all.NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks ended higher on Monday, with Apple giving the S&P 500 its biggest boost as the White House exempted smartphones and computers from new tariffs.  Uncertainty over future tariffs kept a lid on optimism, with the main indexes finishing off their highs of the day.  Investors remain worried about how companies will manage supply chains as more changes are expected on the tariff front.So the "reciprocal" tariffs are off smartphones and some electronics, but maybe only for a while as they could get their own special tariff once the White House has completed a study of the global supply chain.  Indeed, Trump on Sunday told reporters tariffs on semiconductors would be announced over the next week and a decision on phones made "soon".  European stock futures have actually performed better, perhaps on speculation that President Trump will blink on other levies, too.Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsSign in to access your portfolioTry again.
