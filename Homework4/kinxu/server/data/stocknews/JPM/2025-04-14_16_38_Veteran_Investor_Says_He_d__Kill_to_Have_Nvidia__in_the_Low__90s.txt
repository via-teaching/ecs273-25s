Wiley believes that Nvidia's exposure to tariffs is quite low, while its valuation is attractive.During the same segment, Wiley praised JPMorgan (JPM) and its first-quarter results which it recently unveiled.Wiley has led companies that have been involved with financial markets since 1996, according to his LinkedIn profile.NVDA's Exposure to Tariffs Is Low, Wiley Says"Nvidia's exposure to tariffs is less than 5%, some say less than 2%," Wiley stated. Moreover, in the low-$90s, the shares "were on sale," he believes.Although the stock's decline naturally generates fear, such declines have historically been good buying opportunities, according to the veteran investor."Anytime the Vix exceeds 40, there's a 90% chance that you'll make money in the next three years," Wiley told Schwab.  And the average return during that period is 50%-80%, he added.JPM Reported Good Results, Wiley SaidAsserting that JPM delivered good Q1 results "across the board," Wiley noted that its revenue from equity trading jumped 48% year-over-year, while its earnings climbed significantly. Additionally, its return on tangible equity came in at 7.8%, up from "closer to 5%" in March 2023, he added."JPM looks safe and sound," he said.While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.
