Which one is right?Alphabet(GOOG1.21%)(GOOGL1.12%)stock inched higher in Monday trading as the market turned green again on positive news of a moderation ofPresident Trump's tariffson electronic goods. As of 11:05 a.m. ET, the stock is up a modest 2.3%.Also perhaps encouraging investors was a not-too-negative note on Alphabet from investment bankCitigroup.As StreetInsider.com reported this morning, Citi has trimmed itsprice targetson several internet stocks based on its guesses as to how the tariffs, and a generally slowing economy, might depress growth prospects in this sector. Broadly speaking, Citi is reducing its forecast for both revenue and profits growth, but leaving its $195 price target for Alphabet in particular intact.This contrasts with a note from DA Davidson, carried on TheFly.com this morning, that warns of the same slowdown (at least for a couple quarters), but cutsitsAlphabet price target from $200 to $160 -- and rates the stock only "neutral."Investors seem to be siding with Citi in this debate -- but I find myself more in agreement with Davidson. As luck would have it, you see, I was running valuations of my own on a series of stocks on my "shopping list" (stocks I'd like to buy as prices get cheaper) over the weekend. Alphabet was on this list, and I calculated it as selling for just over 25.5 times free cash flow.Relative to a 16% projected growth rate, that yielded aprice-to-free cash flow-to-growth ratioof 1.6, whereas I like to buy for a ratio closer to 1.0. Long story short, I concluded it will take a 30% to 40% reduction in price to entice me to buy the stock. Sure, DA Davidson itself is only lowering its price target by 20%, but at least it's moving in the right direction.Is my valuation too conservative? Perhaps. But I'd rather be safe than sorry. It's going to take about a $100 or so share price to convince meto buy Alphabet stock.Before you buy stock inAlphabet, consider this:The Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andAlphabetwasn’t one of them.
