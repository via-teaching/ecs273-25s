Launched on Monday, this tool lets educators create a list of questions based on specific text input.Using this text-dependent question-generation tool, which utilizes Gemini, teachers can either upload files from Google Drive or manually enter text for the AI to generate questions. They can then export the questions into a Google Doc or Google Form.Educators can choose from a variety of filters, including the grade level, the number of questions, and the type of questions (such as multiple choice or open-ended). Additionally, there is an option for teachers to specify the skills they want their students to demonstrate, such as the use of figurative language or the ability to evaluate arguments.This feature is available only to Google Workspace for Education subscribers who have either the Gemini Education add-on ($24 per user) or Gemini Education Premium ($36 per user).Google initially launched Gemini to Classroom in 2024 and has since expanded its capabilities. The recent update included a tool for creatingvocabulary lists. It can also generate lesson plan ideas and summarize a range of materials, from class notes to student feedback.TopicsRippling is trying to serve Deel’s CEO, but bailiffs can’t find himHertz says customers’ personal data and driver’s licenses stolen in data breachOpenAI’s new GPT-4.1 AI models focus on codingBlue Origin’s all-female crew, including Katy Perry, successfully launchedSilicon Valley crosswalk buttons hacked to imitate Musk, Zuckerberg’s voicesConifer locks down $20M seed round for its ‘drop-in’ electric hub motorJack Dorsey and Elon Musk would like to ‘delete all IP law’© 2025 Yahoo.1,200+ founders & VCs.
