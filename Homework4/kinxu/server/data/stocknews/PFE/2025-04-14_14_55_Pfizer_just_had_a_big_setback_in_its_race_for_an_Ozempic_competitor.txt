Pfizer said that data from the trial will still be submitted to the scientific community for further study.Pfizer was developing danuglipron, an oral GLP-1 drug, as something of a rival to Ozempic and Wegovy, both of which are manufactured by Denmark-based Novo Nordisk (NVO). Early trials had shown that Pfizer’s pill resulted inabout as much weight loss as Wegovy.An oral weight-loss medication would be far less invasive than the injections required by most GLP-1s. Like Pfizer, pharma giants including Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly (LLY), and AstraZeneca (AZN) areworking on their ownoral weight-loss pills. Viking Therapeutics (VKTX), a San Diego-based pharma company, has alsoshown promising resultsin early trials.Despite the setback, Pfizer’s stock was up 0.9% Monday morning. Eli Lilly rose 1.6%, and Novo Nordisk rose 2.5%.For the latest news,Facebook,TwitterandInstagram.Pfizer Inc. will stop developing an obesity pill after the treatment was linked to a potentially drug-related liver injury in a clinical trial patient. The company won't advance the once-daily medicine into the final stage of testing and will instead invest in earlier-stage treatments for obesity. Damian Garde reports on Bloomberg Television.Pfizer  is halting development of its experimental weight-loss pill, as the booming obesity drug market remains out of reach for the drug giant.  The company said Monday the stoppage comes after it reviewed clinical data and a study subject developed a liver injury that might have been caused by the drug, called danuglipron.  Halting the drug’s development means  Pfizer  still is unable to get a cut, for now, of the white-hot obesity market, which analysts say could reach $100 billion by the end of the decade.Pfizer said it will stop development of an oral weight-loss pill after a participant taking the drug in a clinical trial experienced a "liver injury."President Trump said Monday that he is going to impose new tariffs on pharmaceuticals soon.  “Pharmaceuticals we’re going to do,” he said.  Trump has been imposing tariffs as a way to entice companies to move manufacturing to the U.S., where they would avoid import levies.The global demographic shift is reshaping healthcare demand, driving long-term investment in pharmaceuticals, medical devices, home care and digital health.Wall Street analysts said the results for Verve’s therapy appeared competitive on efficacy, while avoiding any major safety concerns — at least so far.Pfizer still has another obesity pill in development, PF-07976016, which is currently in a Phase IIa trial.The drugmaker said one patient became ill after being treated with its experimental weight-loss drug, danuglipron.We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks.
