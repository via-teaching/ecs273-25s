"Our business clients have been performing well, and consumers have shown resilience, continuing to spend and maintaining healthy credit quality," CEO Brian Moynihan said in a statement. "Though we potentially face a changing economy in the future, we believe the disciplined investments we have made for high-quality growth, our diverse set of businesses, and the team's relentless focus on responsible growth will remain a source of strength." While the first quarter was great for Bank of America, a flurry of tariff announcements in the days since the quarter ended means all eyes are on what lies up ahead. Bank of America said its provision for credit loss was up by about $200 million from a year ago, but flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, an indication that the bank is not in panic mode.
