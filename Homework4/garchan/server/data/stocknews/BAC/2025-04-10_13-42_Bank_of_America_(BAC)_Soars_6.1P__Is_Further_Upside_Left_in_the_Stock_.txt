Bank of America BAC shares soared 6.1% in the last trading session to close at $37.15. The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 11.6% loss over the past four weeks.
The increased investor optimism in the stock can be attributed to President Donald Trump’s recent announcement to put a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariff for most countries.
This nation's second-largest bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.4%. Revenues are expected to be $26.74 billion, up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.
While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For Bank of America, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on BAC going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.
