President Trump on Wednesday catapulted US stocks to one of their biggest one-day rallies in the past century with a single post on social media.
At 1:18 p.m. ET, Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social there would be a 90-day pause on his steep "reciprocal" tariffs for non-retaliating countries.
"I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately," part of Trump's post read.
The market exploded higher in reaction.
When the closing bell rang on Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) had gained 9.5% on the day, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) surged 12.1%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 2,962 points, or 7.9%.
It was the S&P 500's best day since 2008, while Nasdaq enjoyed its second-largest one-day rally on record, topped only by a 14% gain back in 2001. For the Dow, Wednesday's rally marked its largest since 2008.
"Over the last few days it looked pretty glum, so I guess they say it was the biggest day in financial history," President Trump said on Wednesday from the White House lawn. "That's a pretty big change."
Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz wrote in a note Wednesday afternoon the market finally got a "dose of relief."
"While uncertainty isn’t headed to zero, the worst-case scenario is off the table most likely," Kantrowitz wrote.
Investors snatched up stocks and saved the questions for later.
Big Tech stocks led the charge higher, with Nvidia (NVDA) shares soaring over 18%, while Tesla (TSLA) added 22%.
Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) rose 15.3%, 14.8%, and 12%, respectively.
And while investors embraced Trump's announcement, the president did escalate his trade war with China, increasing tariffs on imports from China to 125%.
But even stocks that had traded lower in recent days on fears of China tariffs, like Apple, were higher on Wednesday. Shares of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) rose more than 5%, while JD.Com (JD) rallied over 6%.
Wednesday's reversal came as market chaos continued to boil late Tuesday and into overnight trading.
The S&P 500 had swung roughly 6% or more peak-to-trough for three straight sessions through Tuesday, a phenomenon only seen in 1987, 2008, and 2020. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) jumped over 50 basis points over a three-day period, its most aggressive move since 2001.
"The Stock and Bond Vigilantes signal that the Trump administration may be playing with liquid nitro," Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said in a research note published on Tuesday night. "Something may be about to blow up in the capital markets as a result of the stress created by the administration's trade war."
When speaking at the White House on Wednesday, Trump admitted to watching the bond market, but didn't confirm that was the catalyst that made him roll back his tough tariff stance.
"I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy," Trump said.
The 10-year relented some after Trump's post, but yields still settled on Wednesday up about 14 basis points at 4.4%, the highest level since February.
In a sign of more whipsaw on Wednesday, events pushed one of the most closely followed economic research teams on Wall Street to call for recession and then later rescind that stance in less than 90 minutes.
"We are reverting to our previous non-recession baseline forecast with GDP growth of 0.5% and a 45% probability of recession," Goldman chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote on Wednesday after Trump's latest tariff update. Earlier in the day, Goldman had joined peers at JPMorgan in forecasting a recession to hit the US economy this year.
Hatzius' team, though, still maintained their view that the US economy faces a 45% chance of recession, a reminder that there is plenty left to still consider away from the one-day euphoria of Trump's tariff pause.
But at least on Wednesday, markets heard exactly what they've been waiting for from President Trump, and to Piper's Kantrowitz, this suggests the biggest headache for stock investors may be in the rearview.
"Assuming no full 180-degree reversion on reciprocal tariffs," Kantrowitz wrote, "I believe the market lows are in."

The tech industry tried to cozy up to the Trump Administration in the hopes that it could avoid getting caught in the crossfire of his policy moves. But they couldn't dodge his tariffs.
Big Chinese technology companies gained on Thursday as investors focused on the evidence that President Donald Trump is willing to negotiate tariffs.  Alibaba rose 1.2% in Hong Kong, Tencent gained 0.8% and Baidu climbed 2.4%.  Despite Trump raising the effective tariff on Chinese goods to 125%, traders seemed optimistic a deal might eventually be reached between the world’s two largest economies—despite the risks of further escalation.
The tech giants can be defensive stocks in a trade war not because they are insulated but because they are enormous, cash-rich, and have sprawling businesses.
(Bloomberg) -- Janet Yellen stepped to the podium a year ago this week in Beijing to deliver a reassuring message. The US doesn’t want to decouple from China, the then-Treasury secretary said. “Our two economies are deeply integrated, and a wholesale separation would be disastrous for both."Twelve months on, President Donald Trump’s more than 120% tariffs on Chinese goods and Beijing’s determination to fight back in kind mean the seismic cleavage Yellen warned of is rapidly becoming a reality.

The worldwide ripple effects from President Donald Trump’s tariffs have been so widespread that one analyst says some in the business world fear the issue may go beyond Trump simply taking a political stand.  Thomas Lee, a managing partner and the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, sent a memo Wednesday that painted a picture of the fallout from the president’s trade war.  Lee wrote that he has had “many conversations” with macro fund managers who are expressing  concern that those in the White House aren’t acting rationally — and who worry the tariffs go beyond politics and policy.
