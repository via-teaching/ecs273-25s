Tech experts strongly believe that the new tariffs could potentially slow down the AI boom.
“The AI Revolution trade would be significantly slowed down by these head scratching tariffs that NEED to be negotiated to realistic levels.”
In particular, Ives has noted how “near-term pain” may extend longer due to the time required for manufacturing sites in the US to be built and the transition the workforce needs to be equipped with the necessary skills.
“The cost of labor is unrealistic in the U.S. to ever have semi fabs at scale,”

Even though the Trump administration had promised to maintain the US as a leader in artificial intelligence, the newly introduced tariffs may end up having the opposite effect. This is because they are directly impacting the AI industry.
While the government may want more tech manufacturing in the US, the tariffs are undermining the fact that building and running advanced AI is very much still reliant on hardware made overseas, especially chips.
“This is becoming an explosion of global supply chain disorder and chaos. The ramifications are going to be very long and painful.”
Spectators warn that the tariff war is like a tax on the AI system in the US, making things expensive for American developers. The policy doesn’t make much sense as it tends to threaten the very AI technology that it aims to protect.
Nevertheless, many others in the tech world are still quite optimistic.
“It doesn’t seem to me that, of the things you could stop investing in, AI would be very high on the list. If I were a large industrial manufacturer right now, I’d be looking at ways to change my manufacturing location to lower the cost especially in a climate where there’s already labor scarcity or excessive labor costs.”

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a global technology company. Over the weekend, rumors began to spread against the company on platforms such as Reddit and X that Meta has artificially inflated benchmark scores for its forthcoming Llama 4 large language model. Meta’s VP of AI, Joelle Pineau, has firmly denied these manipulations during a presentation at an AI conference in Paris. Pineau, head of artificial intelligence research at Meta (NASDAQ:META), noted that the company is dedicated to transparency and reproducibility. Reuters has previously reported that Pineau plans to depart Meta in May.

Tech stocks are selling off as fears around Trump's tariffs linger.

For the most part, buy-and-hold investing is the way to go, but there can be some good reasons to sell stocks, even during bear markets.
