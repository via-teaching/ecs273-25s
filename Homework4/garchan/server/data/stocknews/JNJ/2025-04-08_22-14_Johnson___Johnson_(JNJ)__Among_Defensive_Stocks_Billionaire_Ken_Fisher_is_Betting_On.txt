We recently published a list of 10 Defensive Stocks Billionaire Ken Fisher is Betting On. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other defensive stocks billionaire Ken Fisher is betting on.
Ken Fisher, an American billionaire investor, author, and financial analyst, founded and runs Fisher Asset Management. He is a world-renowned investment manager recognized for his contrarian approach and strong belief in capitalism. With an estimated net worth of more than $11.2 billion, he ranks among the world’s wealthiest billionaires. The son of famed investor Philip Fisher, also known as the “Father of Growth Investing”, he coupled his father’s growth philosophy with a data-driven value mindset. Long before he became a popular name in the financial industry, Fisher made waves in the 1980s with a revolutionary idea: utilizing the Price/Sales ratio as a major tool for spotting bargain firms. Fisher noted that earnings are frequently erratic, particularly over short periods. Companies may report lower earnings on account of temporary issues such as R&D spending or accounting adjustments. Sales, on the other hand, are more steady and offer a better understanding of a company’s business strength.
Anyone that follows Fisher knows that he is one of the market’s most outspoken pundits. He thinks that, while political developments might elicit strong emotions, they rarely affect the market’s long-term direction. According to Fisher, bull markets often end as a result of either unrestrained investor enthusiasm or an unforeseen economic shock with global implications.
Interestingly, his views on several subjects, notably tariffs, appear to have evolved. Fisher has previously downplayed the potential impact of President Trump’s tariffs, stating that they may not be fully enforced or be in place for as long as anticipated. He also stressed that businesses are highly adaptable to changing economic policies, which he felt may help reduce long-term harm. However, in a recent post on X, the billionaire criticized the government’s plan to impose wide tariff measures:
“What Trump unveiled Wednesday is stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools. Yet, as near as I can tell it will fade and fail and the fear is bigger than the problem, which from here is bullish.”
Over the last two years, the United States has dominated global markets, propelled by large growth stocks in the technology and technology-related communication services sectors, which accounted for more than 40% of US market capitalization, significantly exceeding the rest of the world’s 11%. These firms have greatly increased US returns, but Europe, where such equities account for less than 10% of total market capitalization, missed this edge. Europe’s rising stock presence is primarily restricted to luxury products, which struggled in 2024 as Asian buyers cut spending. As a result, Europe underperformed significantly during the two-year period, returning only 24.1% compared to the US’s 60.3%. Now, however, Europe is taking the lead, and its leading sectors—primarily value stocks linked to economic cycles rather than long-term trends—are primed to benefit, a sentiment that Ken Fisher echoes himself:
“This should be the first year in quite some years where value beats growth. And as that happens, the US lags the non-US world, and particularly Europe, which is so heavily value laden. So that’s been my core forecast. That will remain my core forecast until I see some big change or something different that should make me change my mind. But I babble on these videos pretty much every month, so you can hear that if it ever happens this year. Otherwise, that’s my view. I think it’ll be another big year in the market with global 20% kind of returns.”
