It's now time for some of today's trending tickers, scan the QR code to track the best and worst performing stocks of the day with Yahoo Finances trending tickers page. Today we're following Apple, Alibaba and the drug makers. Let's take a look at Apple up 3% right now. As President Trump's 104% tariff on Chinese imports takes effect. Still, the stock's recent drop put Microsoft back on top as the most valuable company in the US this week. Kenny, your company slate stone has Apple as a top holding. Talk to me about whether or not anything has changed in your view from now.
So at the moment we have not changed our view. The the the fundamentals for Apple, the original reason we own it have not really changed. Yeah, is the tariff did that throw a curve ball? It has, but we're not we're not in a position to say, okay, we're, you know, we're eliminating Apple from the portfolio. It's not just like I, you know, like we talked about before, I'll die with my Apple, you know, because it is what it is. Um, but no, Apple in our view and it's up today, so that's great. It makes me feel good because I own it as well. But, um, I think part of that is because it's off significantly, right? It's a lot of these big names that have been off that have been sold and they're off significantly where investors are finding opportunities, so.
And they're also apparently finding opportunity in China today. We've seen China stocks ripping here. I do want to talk about Alibaba reversing its earlier gains. The Chinese tech company was seeing gains despite US tariffs on China taking effect and President Trump hitting China with that 104% trade levy. China hitting us back with that 84% tariff on all US goods.
It was interesting. If you looked at Asian markets, every one of them were down overnight except Hong Kong and China. They were both up. China was up 1%. I think Hong Kong was up three quarters of a percent, but Taiwan was down 5%, Japan was down 3%. So, yeah, I think people are looking past uh and and uh China stocks today and and Alibaba. We can talk about that, I guess, right?
Well, we can talk about, but one of the things I'm interested in is where investment thesis go as we're kind of taking a step back from globalization. We had China issuing a travel warning for citizens going to the US. Are US investors going to be interested in China stocks if this trade war gets to a point?
So, I'm very biased because I don't own China stocks, right? And the reason I don't is because they don't play by the rules. The rules can change at any moment, right? You want a Chinese stock and then suddenly you wake up and they change the rules and, you know, your investment goes to pot. So I tend to have my China exposure through things like Apple, right? Right. I don't I don't invest directly into China, um, just because I think there are other places there's Europe, there's certainly in the US, there are other opportunities for kind of long-term investment where where I feel stable and safer, uh, because, you know, we're not going to change the rules the way China changes the rules.
Well, and talking about changing the rules, Treasury Secretary's got best on Fox business morning saying that the US could potentially delist Chinese stocks as well.
Well, there's been that, you know, that that conversation has been ongoing back and forth because they don't play by the same accounting rules. Um, and so there's been a lot of push and pull back and forth about, you know, what should we do with China stocks because they don't play by the by the US rules in terms of listings. Right. So that's going to be interesting to see if it finally catches, you know, catches on this time.
Yeah, certainly a transparency question, but do want to talk to you about the drug makers falling today on President Trump's tariff threats. The President commenting at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner saying he's going to announce a major tariff on pharmaceuticals very shortly. You can see on your screen, Pfizer, Merck, Eli Lilly, all moving to the downside. Kenny, are these ownable names in this environment?
Well, so here you go. First of all, I think they are because they're they're big massive drug companies. Uh and so in the long term, yes, I think they are. Now, are they going to come under pressure with this? Certainly, investors are going to are selling it or some investors are selling it right now based on this news. But look, we need the the fact that a lot of our drugs are produced overseas and we're dependent on those markets to to to produce our drugs. I think is a national concern, right? So I think there has to be a push to for the US to produce our own drugs in house, quite honestly. So while I think this is not today is not necessarily a positive for the drug stocks, I think long term, uh those names, Lilly, Merck, all the names that you just mentioned are are fine long-term holdings.
Is healthcare still a safe haven trade?
Well, I think healthcare is a safe haven trade. Look, there's a there's a lot of us baby boomers that are getting ready, right? So I think healthcare is a safe haven trade. Um, again, when the market when the broad market's coming under pressure, they'll all come under pressure, but healthcare will come under less pressure. Yes. I'm bullish on healthcare certainly uh for the long term.
