Trump has since paused most duties, except for China for three months.\r\nFoxconn, Apple's main India supplier, exported smartphones worth $1.31 billion in March, its highest ever for a single month and equal to shipments for January and February combined, according to commercially available customs data reviewed by Reuters.\r\nThis included Apple iPhone 13, 14, 16 and 16e models, and took Foxconn's total shipments from India to the United States this year to $5.3 billion.\r\nExports from Tata Electronics, another Apple supplier, stood at $612 million in March, around 63% higher than the previous month, and included iPhone 15 and 16 models.\r\nApple, Foxconn and Tata did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters is the first to report the shipment details.\r\nCustoms data showed all Foxconn shipments to the United States in March were by air from the Chennai Air Cargo terminal, and landed at various locations, including Los Angeles and New York, with Chicago receiving the majority.\r\nTrump later granted exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones and some other electronics imported largely from China, but later indicated that those exemptions will likely be short-lived.\r\nTo expedite shipments, Apple lobbied Indian airport authorities to cut the time needed to clear customs at Chennai airport in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, to six hours down from 30 hours.\r\nAt least six cargo jets were used in the operation which one source described was a way to \"beat the tariffs\".\r\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil; Editing by Sharon Singleton)"

The company has selected Samsung Display as the exclusive supplier of OLED panels for the device, marking a rare shift from its usual multi-supplier strategy.\r\nIndustry sources say Apple chose Samsung for its proven ability to reduce screen creasesa crucial issue for foldable phones. The panels will likely resemble those used in the iPad Mini, with a 7.8-inch internal screen and a 5.5-inch external display. Pricing is expected to start around $2,000, putting it head-to-head with Samsung's own Galaxy Z Fold lineup.\r\nSamsung Display is expected to start deliveries by late 2025 or early 2026. The exclusive contract could help the company reclaim lost ground in the foldable OLED market, where its share had dropped to about 40% last year. Analysts now expect that number to climb back toward 70% in 2026, boosted by Apple's order.\r\nInitial projections put the foldable iPhone's annual production at 9 million units, but some forecasts now see it surpassing 15 million. That kind of volume could breathe new life into the sluggish foldable segment, which saw just 2.9% growth last year, according to Counterpoint Research.\r\nThe move is also seen as a strategic signal from Appleit's placing quality above price and taking a careful but deliberate step into a new product category. Details like the phone's final design or name haven't been confirmed yet, but its success could shape Apple's future in foldable devices, including iPads and laptops.\r\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

This integration aligns with broader market trends where tech stocks led indices higher amid President Trump�s tariff exemption for electronics, which added a positive sentiment across the tech sector. Apple's integration with CONNEQT Health is a strategic move to enhance its health-focused offerings, adding depth to its ecosystem.

      "body": "Whatever the implementation timeline, US tariffs will significantly impact consumer electronics OEMs and telcos. Apple stands out as being particularly vulnerable, with growing pressure to shift its production to the US. But how feasible is all that?\r\nOn April 11, 2025, just days after announcing new tariffs, the Trump administration exempted smartphones, laptops, processors, displays, and memory chips from tariffs, only to later clarify that this was a temporary reprieve.\r\nThe US government is set to reassess the entire consumer electronics supply chain amid an investigation into semiconductors, which may soon face tariffs. Earlier last week, the president also announced a 90-day suspension of �reciprocal� tariffs for most trading partners. Concurrently, Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to an unprecedented 145%. This indicates a strong push for US production of consumer devices, including Apple iPhones. The pressing question is whether Apple can manufacture its products domestically.\r\nManufacturing Apple devices in the US is possible but would require significant investment and effort from Apple and governmental bodies, both present and future, with years of business disruption in between.\r\nChina has developed a robust consumer electronics ecosystem over decades, with a vast network of suppliers, skilled labor, efficient infrastructure, and ample production sites. Consequently, more than half of Apple�s 200 global suppliers are based in China, where a skilled workforce and favourable conditions for large-scale manufacturing exist.\r\nReplicating this in the US would necessitate attracting skilled labour, reforming educational pathways, and fostering a culture that values higher education�actions that are not currently aligned with the administration�s policies, as evidenced by the recent immigration uproar and the gutting of the US Department of Education. These tariffs, therefore, appear to be geopolitical trade instruments plainly intended to secure more advantageous agreements.\r\nIf Apple cannot secure long-term tariff exemptions, then the cost of its devices will likely rise.\r\nCurrently, 80% of Apple�s overall products are assembled in China, and a 145% tariff could increase the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max to more than $2,600. Apple has begun diversifying production to India and Vietnam, moving about 15-20% of its production there, but remains heavily reliant on China, where 90% of iPhones are still assembled.\r\nIn the meantime, Apple is stockpiling millions of iPhones, with reports of five planeloads of phones and accessories flying into the US from India in the three days following the April 2 tariff communication. However, the upcoming iPhone 17 series, produced in China, may face tariffs, complicating pricing strategies and potentially dampening consumer demand.\r\nApple faces a potential crisis. Should the company be compelled to shift production to the US, it will encounter insurmountable challenges in meeting its current scale of shipments. The company is at risk of a supply-demand imbalance if forced to shift production to the US, which could lead to higher prices and lost sales.\r\nApple�s challenges are compounded in China, its third largest market, by growing negative American sentiment and competition from local Chinese manufacturers like Huawei and Vivo, which are gaining market share due to their technological advancements, as well as their progressiveness in AI. Additionally, rival Samsung�s diversified supply chain � spread across Vietnam, India, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Korea � gives it a competitive edge, as the company is less over exposed to China compared with Apple.\r\nSuffice it to say that Apple has not faced a crisis of this magnitude since its potential bankruptcy in 1997.\r\n\r\nThe gold standard of business intelligence.\r\nFind out more\r\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\r\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\r\n\r\nThematic Take (monthly)\r\nI consent to Verdict Media Limited collecting my details provided via this form in accordance withPrivacy Policy\r\nView all newslettersfrom across the GlobalData Media network.\r\nDecrypting the latest technology news\r\nPowered by\r\n� Verdict Media Limited 2025\r\nThese cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.

WhileApple(AAPL-0.19%)has geographically diversified its supply chain, the company still relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing partners for its devices. Absent any special treatment, prices in the U.S. on Apple products would have likely risen substantially due to the tariffs.\r\nWhile Apple is getting a big break, the relief may be short lived. President Trump later clarified that electronics like Apple's iPhones would be moving into a different tariff \"bucket.\" While Apple's devices may not be subject to the full tariff on Chinese imports, they may eventually be subject to some level of tariffs.\r\nEven if Apple somehow manages to avoid tariffs on its own products, the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, along with the uncertainty created by the Trump administration's generaltariff policy, could hurt the company in another way.\r\nWhile predicting anything about the economy right now is tough, the odds of an economic downturn certainly appear to be rising as businesses and consumers cope with the impact of unpredictable and ever-changing tariffs. Consumer confidence plunged in March, according to The Conference Board, and consumers' short-term expectations regarding economic conditions reached their lowest level in 12 years. These drops were recorded before the Trump administration announced its reciprocal tariffs, which led to a sharp stock market plunge.\r\nSmartphones are an essential item for nearly everyone, but purchases can also be easily deferred. The replacement cycles for smartphones and other electronic devices have been lengthening already, and this effect could go into overdrive during a recession. If smartphones also become more expensive due to tariffs, the replacement cycle could lengthen further.\r\nApple Intelligence, Apple's take onAI-powered featuresfor its devices, probably won't save the day and induce many iPhone users to upgrade. Apple is reportedly having all sorts of problems with a revamped version of Siri, which raises questions about when the promised AI features will arrive and how useful they will be.\r\nNew hardware probably won't help, either. The smartphone market is mature, and annual upgrades don't introduce much more than slightly better performance or other modest improvements. Without a good reason to upgrade, it won't be much of a sacrifice for consumers to kick the can down the road during a recession.\r\n\r\nDespite iPhone sales flatlining and the tariff uncertainty, Apple stock trades for around 28 times the average analyst estimate for fiscal 2025. Analysts are still assuming, by the way, that Apple will manage to grow earnings significantly this year. That forecast could turn out to be overly optimistic depending on how the tariff situation plays out.\r\nI'm not convinced Apple stock deserves that kind of valuation, given all the headwinds facing the company. The iPhone business was already struggling to grow, and an economic slowdown isn't going to help matters. Even if Apple manages to stay out of the tariff crosshairs, sales and profits look likely to take a hit this year. Given the risks, Apple stock looks too expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inApple, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now� andApplewasn�t one of them.

All necessary permits will be expedited and quickly delivered to NVIDIA, as they will to all companies committing to be part of the Golden Age of America!� Trump said in a Truth Social post.\r\nNvidia's announcement brings Big Tech�s investment pledges to US AI infrastructure to just north of $1.6 trillion since Trump's inauguration as thetech world tries to navigate the potential hazards of the president's trade war while staying on the right side of a malleable administration.\r\nNvidia, for its part, did seem to make moves in US manufacturing partially due to Trump�s chaotic approach to trade policy, with on-again, off-again global tariffs affecting imports of AI servers containing its highly coveted GPUs, or graphics processing units.\r\nAsked about Trump�s tariffs at its annual GTC event in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was \"preparing, and we have been preparing to manufacture onshore.\" Huangreportedly attended a dinner at Mar-a-Lagolast week, after which the Trump administration backed off new restrictions on the company's chip exports to China.\r\nNvidia's moves are the latest in Big Tech's splashy announcements of plans to expand investments within the US.\r\nIn February, Apple (AAPL)committed to investing $500 billion to expand its US manufacturingover the next four years.\r\nTSMC (TSM) � which makes the world's most advanced chips with most of its manufacturing capacity in Taiwan �has committed to spending $100 billionover a similar time frame. The company had previously committed $65 billion to building out its US manufacturing capabilities with funding from the 2022 Chips and Science Act.\r\nJust after Trump's inauguration, Oracle (ORCL), OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), and SoftBank (SFTBY) announceda joint venture called Stargate, which the companies said would spend $500 billion on US AI data centers.\r\nAnd after Trump's election, Microsoft (MSFT) said it wouldspend $80 billion to build AI data centers. The company said \"more than half\" of that total would be invested in the US.\r\nApple's US-centric moves have landed in the spotlight again amid Trump's fluctuating tariff policies. Apple announced its $500 billion commitment just days afterTrump said CEO Tim Cookpromised him hundreds of millions of dollars in US investment and implied the pledge was due to his approach to trade policy."

      "body": "After years of teasing the idea, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) isfinallymoving closer to launching its first foldable iPhoneand it's putting all its display chips on one bet. Sources say Apple has chosen Samsung Display as the exclusive supplier for the foldable OLED panels, citing Samsung's (SSNLF) technical lead in minimizing screen creasesarguably the make-or-break feature of a folding phone. Mass production is expected to kick off by late 2025 or early 2026, covering a 7.8-inch main display and a 5.5-inch external screen. For investors, this marks a rare moment when Apple ditches its usual playbook of sourcing from multiple suppliers to drive competition.\r\nWhat's striking is who's not on that list: LG Display. Despite being one of Apple's earliest partners in foldable tech, even co-developing prototype panels back in 2016 and forming a dedicated task force in 2017, LG is now sitting on the sidelines. While Apple's history suggests it could bring in LG for future models if sales scale, this first foldable looks like a one-brand show. The move underscores just how high the bar isand how dominant Samsung's foldable portfolio has become in the premium OLED space.\r\nFor Samsung Display, this deal isn't just about unitsit's about locking in pole position in the next-gen smartphone race. Apple's validation sends a strong signal to the market that Samsung's tech is years ahead when it comes to crease control and panel reliability. If the iPhone Fold takes off, expect this to be the start of a deeper AppleSamsung hardware alignmentand possibly a wake-up call for LG and BOE to rethink their roadmap.\r\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

      "body": "Apple (AAPL,Financials) shares climbed about 2% to close at $202.52 on Monday after KeyBancupgraded the stock, citing the company's exemption from a new round of U.S. tariffs on tech imports.\r\nThe firm raised its rating on Apple to sector weight from underweight following the Trump administration's decision to exclude smartphones, computers, and other electronics from the latest reciprocal tariffs. KeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel said in a note that the decision significantly reduces the downside risk from a prolonged trade conflict between the United States and China.\r\nCiti maintained its outperform rating on Apple but lowered its sales projections for iPhones, Macs, and wearables. The bank cited expectations of a global economic slowdown due to the broader impact of tariffs, even as Apple's core products received exemptions. According to Citi, Apple remains vulnerable to weakening macroeconomic conditions.\r\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the tariff exemption is not permanent and that the administration could introduce new tariffs within the next two months. That raises questions about how long the trade relief will benefit Apple and other tech companies.\r\nWedbush, which also has an outperform rating on the stock, said the temporary nature of the exemption creates space for potential negotiations between the United States and China. The firm noted that Apple and other major tech companies are closely watching for any developments that could renew trade tensions.\r\nDespite the recent gains, Apple shares are down nearly 20% since the start of the year.\r\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

The S&P 500 rose by 0.8%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose by 0.6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by about 0.7%.\r\nREAD ALSO:11 Best American Energy Stocks to Buy Nowand10 Best Stocks Under $10 to Buy Now.\r\nIn recent days, President Trump and his advisers have given mixed signals on the future of tariffs on China and on specific industries. Over the weekend, big American tech companies scored a victory when it was revealed that the US had not put tariffs on smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics.\r\nHowever, on Sunday, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that these electronics would soon be covered under new tariffs, which would be different from those imposed on specific countries. President Trump also posted on social media that there would be “no exception” for these products. He also said that the government is looking at semiconductors and the entire electronics supply chain in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\r\nLast week was the best week for the major indexes since at least 2023. However, with all this uncertainty, Wall Street is getting ready for another week of potential tariff-fueled ups and downs.\r\nTo compile our list of the 14 best American tech stocks to buy now, we used stock screeners from Finviz and Yahoo Finance to find the largest American technology companies. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 30 American stocks. Next, we focused on the 14 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database of more than 1,000 elite hedge funds. Finally, the 14 best American tech stocks to buy now were ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q4 2024.\r\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do?

      "body": "Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) CEOTim Cookpreviously explained the company’s decision to continue manufacturing its products in China, refuting the widespread belief that it’s due to low labor costs.\r\nWhat Happened: A 2024 video of Tim Cook has resurfaced, providing insights into Apple’s manufacturing choices amid the ongoing U.S.-China tariff war. In the video, posted on X by CNBC TV18 reporter Nigel D’Souza, Cook dismissed the idea that Apple’s manufacturing in China is due to low labor costs, stating, “China stopped being a low labor cost company many years ago.”\r\nTrending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.\r\nInstead, he emphasized China’s unparalleled skilled labor concentration in one location and advanced tooling capabilities as the primary reason. Cook emphasized that “the products that we do require truly advanced tooling.”\r\n\r\nOn that note, Cook emphasized the sharp difference in vocational skills between the US and China. The Apple CEO stated, \"In the US, you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I’m not we could fill the room.\" In China, however, \"you could fill multiple football fields.... Hence, the vocational expertise in China is very deep”.\r\nWhy It Matters: The U.S.-China tariff war has put pressure on American companies to shift production back home. Earlier this month, a leading tech analyst predicted asignificant price hikefor Apple iPhones if manufacturing shifts to the U.S., potentially reaching around $3,500. This is due to the complexity of recreating the production ecosystem that currently exists in Asia.\r\nSee Also: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing —this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share.\r\nFurthermore, experts opined that Apple’s supply chain could face major disruptions due to new reciprocal tariffs. Apple had temporarily dodged steep tariffs on Chinese-made electronics following an exemption granted by Trump."

Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.39%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.05%.\r\nThe maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's shares have seen a decrease of 5.36% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 6.26% and falling behind the S&P 500's loss of 3.94%.\r\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Apple in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on May 1, 2025. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.60, showcasing a 4.58% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $93.5 billion, up 3.03% from the prior-year quarter.\r\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $7.20 per share and a revenue of $404.46 billion, demonstrating changes of +6.67% and +3.43%, respectively, from the preceding year.\r\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Apple. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\r\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\r\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.85% lower. Apple is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\r\nInvestors should also note Apple's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 28.12. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 8.99 of its industry.\r\nIt's also important to note that AAPL currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.14. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Computer - Micro Computers industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.46.\r\nThe Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 85, which puts it in the top 35% of all 250+ industries."

The company offers a growing list of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that allow you to invest broadly in the stock market or focus on specific themes or types of stocks.\r\nOne of its many funds is theVanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF(VIG-1.51%). It's one of the smartest funds to buy because it tracks the performance of companies that grow their dividends. Historically, dividend growth stocks have delivered the highest total returns with the lowest risk. That makes this a great fund to buy and hold for 20 years to growyourwealth.\r\nTheVanguard Dividend Appreciation ETFaims to track the performance of theS&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index. The managers of that index designed it to measure the performance of U.S. companies that have consistently increased their dividends for at least the past 10 years.Of note, it excludes the top 25% highest-yielding dividend stocks because these companies typically have higher dividend payout ratios and lower growth profiles. Those characteristics put them at a higher risk of stopping growth or reducing their dividends in the future.\r\nThe ETF's focus on companies that grow their dividends and are at lower risk for a future reduction is worth noting, given the data on dividend stocks by their policies:\r\nDividend Policy\r\nAverage Annual Total Returns\r\nDividend growers and initiators\r\n10.2%\r\nDividend payers\r\n9.2%\r\nNo change in dividend policy\r\n6.8%\r\nDividend cutters and eliminators\r\n(0.9%)\r\nDividend non-payers\r\n4.3%\r\nEqual-weighted S&P 500 index\r\n7.7%\r\nData sources: Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds.\r\nAs that table shows, dividend growers have produced the best returns among dividend stocks by policy while also significantly outperforming non-dividend-payers.\r\nThe ETF has delivered similarly strong returns throughout its history. Since its inception in 2006, the ETF has produced a 9.6% annualized return. Meanwhile, its return over the past 10 years is 11.3%. To put that into perspective, $2,000 invested into the fund at its inception nearly 20 years ago would have grown into about $12,500 today at a 9.6% average annual return.\r\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is818%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\r\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now…\r\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\r\nThe Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF currently holds 337 stocks. It has a higher weighting toward the biggest dividend growth stocks bymarket cap. Currently, the top 10 holdings comprise nearly 32% of its assets.\r\nHowever, these are the cream of the cropwhen it comes todividend growth stocks. For example, the fund's top holding is tech titanApple(AAPL-3.82%), at 4.9% of the fund. The company has increased its payout for 14 straight years while growing it at a nearly 8% annual rate over the past decade. While Apple currently offers a lowdividend yieldof 0.5%, that payout is extremely safe. Apple produced nearly $30 billion in cash from operating activities last quarter, easily covering its $3.8 billion dividend outlay. Meanwhile, with its earnings up 10% last quarter and growing, Apple should have no trouble continuing to increase its dividend in the future.\r\nApple isjustone of the many high-quality dividend growth stocks among the fund's top 10 holdings. Other notable names areVisa, with 16 years of dividend increases;ExxonMobil, with 42 years of dividend growth; andWalmart, with 52 years of increasing its dividend.\r\nOne finalthing to point outis that because the fund focuses on dividend growth and excludes higher-yielding dividend stocks, it has a lower dividend yield than some other dividend-focused ETFs: It recently yielded around 1.7%. However, the fund should still deliver attractive total returns in the future as the underlying companies grow their earnings and dividends, which should steadily increase their stock prices.\r\nDividend growth stocks have historically outperformedotherdividend stocks and dividend non-payers over the long term. Given its focus on dividend growth stocks, buying the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is wise. The fund should deliver strong total returns over the decades,which should enableinvestorsto meaningfully increase their wealth by buying and holding this fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy shares in theVanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and theVanguard Dividend Appreciation ETFwasn’t one of them.

Digital platforms would bear the brunt, realizing $29 billion less in ad spending, with TV facing a $12 billion shortfall.\r\nRead more:What is a recession, and how does it impact you?\r\nEven before theTrump administration's April 2 announcementof a 10% baseline tariff on nearly all foreign imports, MoffettNathanson said companies were already in wait-and-see mode, holding back ad spending while trade policy remained unclear.\r\nRead more:The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\r\nIt's a stark reversal from the significant spending rebound the advertising industry enjoyed in 2024 on the back of record political spending, a booming economy, and lingering momentum from the post-pandemic digital and e-commerce boom.\r\nBut as MoffettNathanson argued, the tone has shifted from \"softly pessimistic\" to \"significantly more bearish.\"\r\n\"The shift is driven largely by the current administration's unorthodox and aggressive approach to addressing 'unfair' trade practices,\" the analysts said. \"The heightened uncertainty following the tariff announcement has led us to adopt a more cautious outlook for advertising.\"\r\nCompanies heavily reliant on advertising — like Meta (META), Snap (SNAP), and the Trade Desk (TTD) — would be hit \"disproportionately harder,\" with projected stock declines of at least 30% each, the firm estimates.\r\nDigital players with variable cost structures and less reliance on advertising, like Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), are \"better positioned to weather the storm.\"\r\nMeanwhile, connected TV player Roku (ROKU) would see the biggest relative impact, flipping from positive earnings in 2024 to a net loss in both 2025 and 2026, according to MoffettNathanson's projections."

      "body": "President Trump’s tariffs have overshadowed Applied Materials (AMAT) stock, stirring up short-term headaches for thesemiconductorequipment titan. Despite a recent rebound, shares trade ~30% below their 52-week highs, with the decline somewhat justified. Indeed, higher costs and global trade tensions could dent the company’s near-term prospects. Still, the effort to restore chip manufacturing to U.S. soil promises a lucrative payoff in the long run. Given this narrative and AMAT’s unmatched role in chip production, I’m bullish on the stock.\r\nDiscover outperforming stocks and invest smarter withTop Smart Score Stocks.\r\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities usingTipranks' Stock Screener.\r\nEven with a90-daytariffpause on semiconductors and electronics announced last Friday, it’s clear that Applied Materials faces choppy waters. The remaining 10% global tariff hike will undoubtedly damage chipmakers like Intel (INTC) and TSMC (TSM), who depend on imported wafers, gases, and components. This will squeeze their budgets, potentially freezing orders for AMAT’s high-end tools.\r\nTake its $20 million etching systems, for instance, or its deposition chambers, critical for cutting-edge chips. China’s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods further threaten AMAT’s foothold in a market that, for context, accounted for 30% of last year’s $26.5 billion in revenue.\r\nThe uncertainty is already biting. A single delayed fab can wipe out $500 million in AMAT orders, and with Asian chipmakers like Samsung rethinking expansion amid tariff chaos, you can see why the market might think that AMAT’s multi-billion-dollar backlog risks stalling. And then you have a story about Trump’s looming semiconductor-specific tariffs, which the market expects to hit within months. Undoubtedly, they keep customers jittery, as they are reluctant to greenlight projects when costs could spike overnight. It’s like a waiting game where hesitation makes more sense than action, leaving AMAT to tread carefully through a murky year.\r\nIf AMAT’s outlook wasn’t already wobbly, the company’s supply chain isn’t immune. Tariffs on niche materials, like high-purity silicon or rare-earth metals, could inflate costs, forcing the company to either absorb the hit or pass it on, risking customer pushback. So, for now, AMAT stock is facing pressure on multiple fronts.\r\nDespite the potential headwinds I just mentioned, investors should keep their minds open and consider that a bullish case might be hiding in the shadows. If Trump’s dream of a U.S. chipmaking renaissance pans out, maybe, just maybe, Applied Materials could be the golden goose. Tariffs are designed to lure chipmakers to American soil, and AMAT, the king of deposition and etching tools, is primed to cash in."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes.\r\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC’sSquawk on the Street, Jim Cramer reacted to the partial tariff exemptions announced by the White House, interpreting them not as a full retreat, but as a strategic pause designed to avoid punishing American companies. He suggested the administration was being careful not to hand over competitive advantages to Southeast Asian rivals, particularly Samsung:\r\n“So what I saw today, and not to be facetious, but what I see is people saying, you know what, we’ve seen the downside. Maybe we can test it again. But the president has, I don’t want to say blink, because that’s nonsense. What the president did was say, OK, look, we’re not going to continue to punish American companies and give the green light to Korea. I don’t know if you heard Lutnick’s words. He was very specific. Southeast Asia. That’s Samsung. They didn’t want to give the ball to Samsung.”\r\nREAD ALSO:Jim Cramer Hints at a Bigger Agenda Behind Tariffs and Breaks Down These 7 StocksandJim Cramer Reacts to the Surprise Market Surge and Highlights 8 Key Stocks.\r\nTurning to currency dynamics, Cramer pushed back on what he sees as misplaced panic over a weakening U.S. dollar. Instead, he argued that a softer dollar actually benefits American multinationals and gives long-needed relief to CFOs who’ve spent years blaming currency strength for lost market share:\r\n“Well, look, I’m not so certain I’m going to do a little contrary stuff on the dollar here. When we listen to conference calls, for the last four years, all we hear about is it would have been so much better if the dollar weren’t so strong. We keep losing share, the dollar’s too strong. Suddenly the dollar’s weaker, and now we start hearing all the downside, what, the bonds? I mean, I’m almost thinking that, I’m gonna put this out there, the people who are saying that it’s the end of the world, that the dollar is weaker, I think they have to go do some work boots on the ground. […] So suddenly the dollar’s weaker and we are petrified? These are people who have an agenda. And their agenda is to say, you know what matters more than anything else? Our hegemony from a strong dollar. And I don’t get it. If you’re in our business of picking stocks, you’re sick and tired of hearing CFOs say, we are done. We’ve got to stop this dollar rise.”"

      "body": "Madison Millsand Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick examine some of today's trending tickers.\r\nNvidia (NVDA) stock is falling after the company warned that new US chip rules on exports to China would cost the company $5.5 billion. Analysts at Bank of America, Piper Sandler, and Raymond James lowered their price targets for the chipmaker stock.\r\nApple's (AAPL) India suppliers shipped $2 billion worth of iPhones in March ahead of US President Trump's tariffs.\r\nWall Street's top financial firms, like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS), saw record-high trading revenue in the first quarter, driven by tariff-fueled market volatility.\r\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\r\nIt's now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Nvidia, Apple, and Wall Street banks. First up, several Wall Street firms cutting their price targets on Nvidia stock after the chip maker disclosed that it anticipates a $5.5 billion charge from new chip curbs. The US government told Nvidia earlier this month it would need a special license to export certain chips to China. Analysts at BFA Global Research, Piper Sandler, and Raymond James all lowering their price targets on the news. And also, Steve, what I also thought was really interesting here is an analyst over at City talking about how it's not just about Nvidia. This could also impact Broadcom. This could also impact other chip names in the space.\r\nWell, you're seeing them, you're seeing them sell off today. I mean, you know, AMD announced an $800 million charge along in there. Um, you know, Broadcom was trading lower this morning as well. ASML was trading lower, although they released earnings, but, but they're all, they're all part and parcel of this. This is not good news for the chip sector, because, you know, I, I don't mean to just sound like a broken record, but this is uncertainty, and uncertainty, the markets don't love uncertainty.\r\nWell, speaking, speaking of uncertainty, let's get to another name we're looking at. Apple's main suppliers in India shipping roughly $2 billion worth of iPhones in March ahead of President Trump's reciprocal tariffs announcement. That is according to new customs data. Smartphones have since secured a temporary reprieve from tariffs, but persistent tensions between the US and China threaten the iPhone maker's China-focused supply chain in the longer term. The Wall Street Journal reporting Apple is investigating moving some iPhone production to the US, but the process could take years, and CEO Tim Cook has said in the past that it would be difficult to find the skilled labor in America that's needed to build the smartphones. Treasury Secretary Scott Beson dismissed that comment and concern in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\r\nYou don't need a PhD in mechanical engineering to assemble an iPhone. So, I, I'm not sure why Tim Cook says that the skills aren't here.\r\nAnd Steve, I think what analysts who cover Apple might say and investors might say is that that skilled labor does take years to build up, and it's certainly something that allows Apple to turn out these iPhones incredibly quickly.\r\nWell, that's it. I mean, every, you know, labor now is not just, you know, pounding a hammer or nail. There, there's, there's, there's intricacies in the supply chain. You know, I, I know that, you know, the commerce secretary with his comment, you know, we're going to have lots of people screwing tiny little screws into things. That's not what people really want. You know, we want the high-tech value-added manufacturing because, quite frankly, our cost basis is higher. So, if there's value-added stuff to be done, that's great. If it's just, if it's just bringing low-skilled labor, bringing back low-skilled jobs, that's not necessarily, you know, I understand the need for that, particularly maybe in some strategic industries, but overall, I think we want people bringing a skill set to it. You know, I saw a statistic, this was posted on, on, on Twitter by my friend Frank Luntz who I trust. Um, and he got the statistics from the Cato Institute. 80% of the people when asked, said, do you want more manufacturing in the US? 80% said yes. When asked, would you take a factory job? 75% said no. 23% said yes. The other two said I already have a factory job. So, it, it's, you know, it's one of these, it's nice in theory, but in practice, um, you know, you need skilled, the people who are going to take these jobs, by definition, are really going to be skilled labor. Not, not just, you know, people, not just, you know, automatons screwing in screws.\r\nYeah. Right. The price that they're requiring for their labor requires it to be skilled. All right. Finally, trading desks at some of the biggest names in banking crashed in, cashed in, rather, on market volatility in the most recent quarter. And that is not including the past two weeks, which fell outside of that reporting period. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Goldman, all seeing record equity trading revenue during the quarter. Despite the blockbuster results, executives did express some caution about the current macro backdrop. JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon warning of considerable turbulence roiling the US economy. Well, Goldman's David Solomon said the prospects of a recession had increased. You couldn't pay Solomon to mention the word tariffs, but he did semi-maybe allude to it in that comment. Is this trading revenue for banks a signal of strength in your view, Steve? Or is this something that can kind of hide any economic macro concerns?\r\nKind of the latter. You know, I remember I spent the bulk of my career as an option trader, and I used, I loved environments like this. Um, you know, and to Jamie Dimon's comment, you know, about turbulence, you know, I always described VIX as sort of the price of a parachute when the plane hits turbulence at some level. You know, people want that protection. But here's what happens during volatility with, if you're an active trader. You widen your spreads, you shrink your sizes. So, effectively that really impairs liquidity, but if you're the person trading off those bid offs, bid-ask spreads, each trade you do is more profitable. And so, yes, that leads to the trading desks making more money, but really, you know, analysts typically discount that over time. It's actually a little odd this quarter that the analysts are very happy that the banks are making all this money trading because for years, again, as a trader at a publicly traded firm, the analysts were always very dismissive when we had a good quarter.\r\nYeah. Right, right, because it's potentially not a sign of continued gains for, for the banks. Steve, thank you so much for sticking with us.

      "body": "President Trump is determined to bring tech manufacturing to the US via massive tariffs. But there's little chance companies like Apple (AAPL) will reinvent their supply chains before Trump leaves office in 2028.\r\nThe Trump administration hit China with a whopping 145% tariff on Chinese-made goods before announcing exemptions for tech devices ranging from smartphones to laptops on Friday. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during an interview with Jonathan Karl of ABC News on Sunday that the movewas temporary and only applied to Trump's reciprocal tariffs.\r\nInstead, he explained, tech products will be tariffed as part of the administration's planned duties on semiconductors, which could be announced later this week.\r\nStill, even the threat of sky-high tariffs won't be enough to force tech giants like Apple to pick up and move their suppliers to the US en masse.\r\nRead more:The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\r\n\"Anything is possible, but the setup of smartphone production in India has been a three-year process from site identification through ramped-up production, with at least another two years to achieve full supply chain integration,\" Chris Rogers, head of supply chain research at S&P Global Market Intelligence, told Yahoo Finance.\r\nIt's not just about timing. Companies would also need the workers to build devices.\r\n\"While there's a degree of automation possible and while many of the components needed are made in the US, there's still a need for tens of thousands of trained electronics assemblers willing to work long, arduous hours in highly repetitive tasks,\" he added.\r\nCompanies including Nvidia (NVDA), TSMC (TSM), Apple, and others have announced increased investments in the US to win over Trump and avoid tariffs. On Monday, Nvidia said it will produce $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years through partners including Foxconn (601138.SS), TSMC, and Wistron (3231.TW).\r\nApple also said it will spend $500 billion, and TSMC has said it will spend $165 billion. Many of those plans, however, were already in the works or don't necessarily goabove prior spending levels. Nvidia, for example, talked upbuilding chips in the US last year.\r\nAnd while that doesn't take away from the fact that the companies are pouring money into the US, it doesn't exactly support the idea that they're moving vast amounts of their manufacturing capabilities to America.\r\n\"We believe hardware companies will remain focused on accelerating US-bound product assembly out of China, and see India and Mexico as the most-likely incremental beneficiaries of these actions (we'd argue Vietnam and Mexico have been the biggest beneficiaries over the last 5 years),\" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in an investor note."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025.\r\nOn April 4, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives appeared on CNBC to discuss the potential impact of current tariffs and compared the situation to an economic armageddon. If the current tariffs remain in place, Ives thinks it would lead to a 15% to 20% demand reduction across the board. He thinks that investor anxiety is much higher considering how things were in the March 2020 COVID-19 crash earlier. The analyst thinks that investors should now focus on the likelihood of tariff adjustments from comments about negotiations, the impact on consumer-focused companies, and the potential for demand destruction. He even thinks that companies may refuse to provide guidance in the first-quarter earnings calls due to the persistent tariff uncertainty.\r\nIves thinks that a lot of tech companies will not be able to absorb high tariff increases and rather this cost will be passed on to the consumers which will lead to significant margin erosion and even potential sales declines. He indicated that tech stocks are currently pricing in a 10% to 15% cut to numbers. He suggests that investors should now look at companies with strong long-term potential as he believes earnings may normalize in 2025 and 2026. The analyst also addressed the defensive performance of defense contractors. While acknowledging the relative stability here, Ives cautioned that even these even such sectors are not immune to tariffs. He noted the significant foreign component, specifically 40% to 50% in some instances, in hardware and other sectors.\r\nOur Methodology\r\nWe sifted through the financial media reports to compile a list of the top NASDAQ stocks to buy for 2025.

The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\r\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

      "body": "Markets\r\nHot Stocks\r\nFear & Greed Index\r\nLatest Market News\r\nHot Stocks\r\nFollow:\r\nThose shopping for a new smartphone or computer may be spared from tariff-induced sticker shock. At least, for now.\r\nPresident Donald Trumpissued a memorandumon April 11 saying certain electronics — including computers, smartphones and some components — won’t be subject to the reciprocal tariffs imposed on imports from China. While tariffs on virtually all other products from China are now at least 145%, prices of smartphones and certain other devices should avoid completely skyrocketing, at least for a little while.\r\nBut with comments from the Trump administration indicating an upcoming wave of tariffs on semiconductors — a critical part of the chips that power electronic devices — it’s still unclear if and when tech products could get more expensive in the US. Plus, the current exclusions aren’t expected to cover many everyday tech products that consumers are likely to buy more frequently than new phones — such as some charging cables and earbuds.\r\nThat makes it challenging for shoppers to know what to expect, but also for tech companies to adjust their supply chains and shipments as demand potentially fluctuates due to tariff-induced price swings — all while keeping prices reasonable.\r\n“It’s completely impossible for any company to plan,” said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president of client devices for the International Data Corporation, a firm that tracks global shipments of tech devices. “So the best, the only thing they can do at the moment is… ship as many products as they can while the exemption lasts to the US.”\r\nSome reports indicate that companies may be doing just that. Apple’s India-based suppliers shipped a record number of iPhones to the US in March, nearly $2 billion worth, according toReuters. PC shipments grew by 12.6% in the US during the first quarter of 2025 as vendors increased shipments ahead of potential tariffs, market research firm Gartner said in a press release Monday.\r\nThe exception is a major win for Apple, which relies on iPhone sales for most of its revenue — about $69 billion of its roughly $124 billion in its first fiscal quarter of 2025 — and has much of its smartphone supply chain located in China. But the Trump administration has indicated that more tech tariffs are coming.\r\nTrump wrote in aTruth Social poston Sunday that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” when it comes to tariffs, adding that “there was no tariff exception” announced and these products are still subject to a 20% tariff on Chinese imports.\r\nThe excepted products will be moved to a “different tariff bucket” as the administration examines the “whole electronics supply chain,” the post said. The Trump administration on Monday beganinvestigating semiconductor importsto set the stage for tariffs.\r\nKevin Hassett, national economic council director, said when speaking with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday that “it was always the case” that semiconductors would be covered under a separate action rather than reciprocal tariffs.\r\nThe exception came after Trump’s tariff policies resulted in a whirlwind couple of weeks forthe stock market, with the S&P 500 having its worst week since 2020earlier this month.\r\nBut thestock market saw massive gainslast week when Trump announceda 90-day pauseon most reciprocal tariffs, a sign that investors were seeking a reprieve from his levies.\r\nThe exclusions specifically mention smartphones, computers (describedas “automatic data processing machines”), monitors, storage devices and various components that power those devices, including integrated circuits and transistors.\r\nBut a host of other tech products don’t appear to be included in the exceptions, such as USB charging cables, portable battery packs, headphones and video game consoles, a public affairs officer for the US International Trade Commission said in response to a CNN inquiry about whether these products fall under the exceptions.\r\nBut it’ll likely depend on which components are inside these devices and how they’re categorized.\r\nThe US ITC also said computer mice and keyboards are covered under the exceptions, but added that US Customs and Border Protection has the final say on how imported goods are classified and whether they’re exempted from tariffs.\r\n“It’s a gray area,” said Dave Marcotte, a senior vice president and analyst with market research and consultancy firm Kantar. “This is where you get creative about describing your products when you move to Customs. If you look at the scheduling and say, ‘Okay, well, I have, I have peripherals. Are peripherals covered? Or (are) computer cables covered?’ Well, they’re the same thing.”\r\nEven before Trump specified these exclusions, some analysts had expected smaller items like charging cables and headphones to be among those most heavily impacted by tariffs.\r\n“I think the first things you’re going to see (are) the stuff we don’t really pay attention to, like… USB chargers and batteries and stuff that’s less than, say, $20, $25,” Marcotte said last week ahead of Trump’s exception on smartphones and other select tech products. “It’s going to be the small stuff.”\r\nSmaller companies don’t have the supply chain flexibility of a stalwart like Apple, for example, and the margins on cheaper items such as charging cables are much lower. That means these firms don’t have as much flexibility to absorb additional tariff costs and would likely have to pass it down to consumers to turn a profit.\r\nAnd many of these ancillary tech gadgets appear to be from China.\r\nWhen CNN searched Amazon for earbuds under $50, iPhone charging cables and portable battery packs, many of the top five results for each product either had China listed as the country of origin, or mentioned a manufacturer based in China. Some of the results didn’t name a country of origin, but other product pages from the same sellers listed products as coming from China.\r\nTrump also got rid of the “de minimis exemption,” which allowed packages valued at less than $800 to enter the US tax-free — another change that’s expected to impact the prices cheap goods from China.\r\nPrice hikes on these smaller, cheaper items could feel more impactful to consumers in some cases since the difference in price may feel more drastic.\r\n“A $40 increase to an $80 increase looks a lot worse for a consumer than, say, a $1,200 to $1,500,” said Jack Leathem, an analyst at market research firm Canalys.\r\nAlthough some tech products got a break on certain reciprocal levies, new tariffs on semiconductors are expected to arrive in the “next month or two,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick toldABC Newson Sunday. It’s part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to reduce US reliance on China while reshoring manufacturing.\r\nBut tariffs or not, the chances of an American-made iPhone seem slim. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump believes iPhone production could move to the US, but higher labor costs and the logistics of shifting Apple’s massive production network to the other side of the world — further away from Asia, where many components would likely still be sourced — present major challenges.\r\nAnd it’s not just the components. Finding workers would be an issue, too.\r\n“It’s very hard to find skilled labor in the numbers they need,” Jeronimo said.\r\nApple in February announceda $500 billion investmentto expand its US operations. But that commitment is largely focused on building production facilities for Apple Intelligence servers and boosting education in manufacturing, not building iPhones. And while several tech leaders like chipmaking giants TSMC and Nvidia have announced major US expansions, the tech supply chain is largely expected to remain in China, says Jeronimo.\r\nCompaniesare more likely to shift some production to other regions, like the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, according to Jeronimo.\r\nTrump’s tariff policy is alreadyseems to be impacting some tech product launches and shipments. The US smartphone market grew more than 5% in the first quarter of 2025, according to the IDC, partially driven by a “sense of urgency to buy before potential price increases,” the IDC’s research director for client devices Anthony Scarsella said in a Monday press release.\r\nNintendo also postponed US preorders for its newSwitch 2 gameconsole in early April as it assesses the tariff situation.\r\n“You stockpile during a hurricane because it happens for five days,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, vice president and principal analyst at market research firm Forrester. “There is no pantry in the world that’s large enough where you can stockpile four years’ worth of trade policy uncertainty.”\r\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

And Trump has promised that most electronics will still get wrapped up in his tariffs, which could hurt Apple."

World stocks fell into a downward spiral on Wednesday led by tech losses after Washington said it is putting new curbs on AI chip exports to China, marking an escalation in the global trade war.\r\nThe Trump administration's latest broadside sparked huge demand for safe-haven assets like gold, the Swiss franc and U.S. Treasuries, even though Fed Chair Jerome Powell signalled he is in no rush to cut interest rates.\r\nIf U.S. Big Tech had acquired a safe-haven status in the eyes of some investors in recent years, it is disappearing fast.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)stands against other best blue chip stocks to buy according to billionaires.\r\nThe US stock market is showing volatility after President Donald Trump’s recent announcement of sweeping 10% tariffs on all US trading partners and higher tariffs on countries with a trade deficit with the US.\r\nEconomists and investors believe President Trump’s tariff policies could potentially lead to a trade war with America’s trading partners, propelling inflation even higher. These two factors could plunge the US into an economic slowdown, and the markets could potentially sell off quickly if a recession materializes among its looming threats.\r\nOn April 10, CNBC reported that stock prices rose sharply a day before after declining for four days straight following President Trump’s announcement of a pause in a significant part of his tariff plan. The White House said that Democratic lawmakers were indulged in partisan games by inquiring if any stock market purchases conducted in recent days were undertaken with prior knowledge of the fact that President Trump would authorize a pause in his tariff plans. Trump announced higher tariffs on China even after he announced a 90-day pause for steeper-than-baseline rates for several other countries.\r\nREAD ALSO:10 Best Medical Stocks to Buy According to Billionairesand10 Best Organic Food Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires.\r\nOn April 11, Erica York, economist and the vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy, talked to CNBC’s “The Exchange” about the ongoing scenario and said that the imposition of around 145% total tariff on Chinese goods would result in a suspension of most trade between the US and China. She said:\r\n“It depends on how narrowly the tariff is applied or how broadly it’s applied, but generally, if you get north of a triple-digit tariff, you are cutting off most trade.”\r\nShe further opined that:\r\n“There may still be some things without any substitutes that companies just have to foot the bill, but for the most part, that cuts it off.”\r\nThe economist said that Trump’s new China tariffs, along with the others he implemented, would raise the average tariff rate to record highs the country hasn’t seen since the 1940s. The current market volatility has created numerous remarkable investment opportunities, so let’s look at the 15 best blue chip stocks to buy according to billionaires."

      "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Mark Zuckerberg, the first witness in the Federal Trade Commission’s trial to break up his social media empire, gave a rare window into how he makes business decisions: by fighting for survival, even when his company is ahead.\r\nMost Read from Bloomberg\r\nTrump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space\r\nHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?\r\nWhy the Best Bike Lanes Always Get Blamed\r\nDOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on Leave\r\nLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs\r\nOver a marathon three days of testimony, the Meta Platforms Inc. co-founder and chief executive officer clearly articulated how the social media market has evolved rapidly over time — which, if the judge agrees, could make it more difficult for the FTC to prove Meta dominates it.\r\nZuckerberg was composed, but occasionally evasive, when challenged to explain past emails and other private messages indicating a concerted effort to muscle out competitors.\r\nThose old messages and emails, gathered during the pre-trial discovery process, were more damning than his present-day testimony. The messages, often between Zuckerberg and other top Meta executives, painted a picture of an executive who was paranoid about his rivals and willing to buy competitors whenever possible.\r\nThe FTC is seeking to force Meta to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that the two acquisitions have given Meta an illegal monopoly over parts of the social networking industry. Emails and documents presented at trial show that Meta, then called Facebook Inc., struggled to compete in the mobile app boom in the early 2010s, buying up successful competitors. The FTC said Meta bought the companies to eliminate direct competitive threats.\r\nMultiple Competitors\r\nZuckerberg and Meta’s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Meta faces a wide array of competitors that fight for user attention, including ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, Google’s YouTube, Apple Inc.’s iMessage and Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that TikTok, in particular, posed a “highly urgent” competitive threat when it sprang up in 2018.\r\n“We observed that our growth slowed down dramatically,” as TikTok gained popularity, Zuckerberg said Wednesday. “It was highly urgent, this has been a top priority for the company for several years.” Meta eventually rolled out a direct competitor, called Reels, that now drives a significant amount of video traffic for the company.\r\nZuckerberg was at times vague over his three days in court, and regularly disputed the FTC’s interpretations of his prior emails. As a leader, the way he communicated with staff was often blunt or harsh, and he spent time on the stand trying to add more nuance to what was written by his younger self. He occasionally clashed with the FTC’s lead lawyer, Daniel Matheson, who objected at one point that Zuckerberg wasn’t answering his questions."

Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes.\r\n“Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,” he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, “Except this isn’t an eight-part blockbuster, it’s our money.” Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday’s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic.\r\nCramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a “liberation day bottom,” a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, “Not sure, I’m just not sure.” He added:\r\n“Have you ever noticed the weekends don’t provide relaxation anymore because the president’s got advisors? He’s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He’s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime…. Monday’s trading, well, let’s just say that it looks like that it’s earning season so it’s gonna be even harder than usual.”\r\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\r\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

The market’s third borrower Tuesday, Japanese financial firm Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., priced $3 billion of notes.\r\nThe longest portion of Wells’ offering, an 11-year security, yields 1.28 percentage point above Treasuries, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified as the details are private. Goldman’s longest portion, a six-year tranche, yields 1.25 percentage point above Treasuries, a separate person said.\r\nMorgan Stanley, JPMorgan Lead $16.5 Billion Bank Borrowing Spree\r\nIt’s common for the biggest US banks to sell debt shortly after releasing quarterly results. But there were some questions this go-around after the primary market froze earlier this month in the wake of an evolving global trade war.\r\nTuesday’s deals received orders 3.3 times the amount of bonds sold, according to Bloomberg’s Brian Smith, compared with 3.8 times on Monday.\r\n“Clearly there’s appetite for sizable bank issuances,” said Peter Simon, an analyst who covers the sector at research firm CreditSights. “We don’t see much evidence that the market is overly concerned with these banks, which makes sense given their results have been solid this quarter.”\r\nGoldman reported record revenue in the first quarter, while Wells Fargo’s report pointed to soft loan demand amid the ongoing tariff uncertainty. Wells’ net interest income, the difference between what it makes from lending and pays for deposits, fell short of analysts’ projections. Still, non-interest expenses were better than forecast as Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf works to cut costs.\r\nIn the high-grade market, banks have underperformed in recent weeks, with TD Securities credit strategist Hans Mikkelsen writing that was likely due to expectations of new debt sales. The average bank bond spread widened 24 basis points this month through Monday, more than investment-grade notes overall while yields for the latter briefly hit 11-month highs last week."

      "body": "Bank of America (BAC) and Citi (C) beat expectations with strong first quarter results, boosting investor confidence and lifting both stocks. RBC Capital Markets bank analyst Gerard Cassidy joins Market Domination to break down what's driving bank earnings.\r\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere.\r\nBank of America and Citi reporting first quarter earnings this morning, beating on the top and bottom lines and following a trend of strong Q1 bank earnings. For more, we're bringing in now Gerard Cassidy, analyst at RBC Capital markets, covering the banking sector. Gerard, it's great to see you as always. So, listen, the bank earnings they continue to roll in, Gerard. We heard from Bank of America and Citi this morning. Investors clearly like what they heard there. Both those stocks are higher in today's trade. Broadly, how would you characterize what we've heard, Gerard, from the sector you know so well? I mean, it has seemed generally positive, Gerard.\r\nJosh, you're absolutely right. The results have been good. Um, the banks have generally beaten all of our estimates on the street consensus EPS estimates as well as my own. And I think part of the reason is of course, the capital markets businesses for the large money center banks and for Goldman and Morgan Stanley were really strong in trading, particularly equity trading. So that was a large reason for the beats from most of these companies. Also credit. Credit remains very resilient even though they're building up reserves as they're required to do under the new accounting standard called CECL, current expected credit losses. When I say new, it's January of 2020 when it was introduced. So I think what we're seeing is that you know, the first quarter of course had two months of no commentary about tariffs. It was only in March that the commentary started to be elevated. And April of course has been very volatile. So I think what we're seeing is first quarter results overall are better than expected. Credits strong. Capital levels are very healthy. Liquidity is high. It's really the future and the unknown of the future that has everybody on edge.\r\nHow long do you think the elevated volatility, that the trading volume that comes from that, can make up for muted deal activity? Can that continue for a couple of quarters or is there a limit to how far that could take you?\r\nIt's a really good question because it was outstanding in the first quarter and it did more than offset, you know, the lower, the lower numbers in some of the selected investment banking categories, particularly ECM, equity capital markets. The IPO market has really kind of fizzled out here due to this volatility. So you really need volatility and volumes to go with it to enable these larger firms to offset any slowdown in activity and advisory, which is M&A activity of course, and then the ECM business. Um, the DCM, debt capital markets had a very strong first couple of months of the year. It has slowed down a little bit. So you're right, we will need to see elevated volumes and volatility if the investment banking markets don't come back. Ideally, if we could have some resiliency in the markets and less volatility, you might get a combination of lower revenues and trading, but more than offset by incremental pickup in the advisory and the ECM business. So we'll have to see how that plays out, but right now the uncertainty is really weighing on the ECM and advisory business at this time."

      "body": "Big banks are offering the latest view of how their customers are faring amid President Trump's tariff turmoil, andit's not all bad— at least for now.\r\n\"The message has really been that the sky is not falling,\" Saul Martinez, a bank analyst for HSBC, told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.\r\nFive of the country's largest banks over the past week posted first quarter rises in profits and revenue, driven in part by trading operations that benefited from the market volatility triggered by the initial rollout of Trump's first tariffs in February and March.\r\nRead more:The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\r\nCollectively, net profits at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Goldman Sachs (GS) amounted to $35 billion, a 13% increase from the year-ago quarter. Revenue also rose at all of these banks. Trading revenue alone jumped 17% to more than $36 billion.\r\nMany banks said their consumer customers were still spending, defaults were still manageable, and businesses were not experiencing distress despite the uncertainty about the months ahead. None of the institutions with big Wall Street footprints updated their earnings outlooks for the rest of the year, either.\r\nWhat these results didn't include, however, was the volatile period that followed Trump's April 2 \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement, which took place two days after the quarter ended. Stocks and bonds plunged and have yet to fully recover, ushering in new uncertainty about the economy and the safety of US assets.\r\n\"We're surprised about the degree of ongoing firmwide strength at all 5 big banks ... and the more than expected upbeat views,\" said Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo in a Tuesday note.\r\n\"To us, it all says that events since Apr 2 can still be little more than a speed bump, so long as policy moves faster to help ease most of the uncertainty,\" he added, in reference to promised deregulation of the banking industry expected from the Trump administration.\r\nNot that banks and their top executives were entirely upbeat. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said that the prospect of a recession \"has increased.\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the economy faces \"considerable turbulence,\" with a recession as a \"likely outcome.\"\r\nIn such a scenario, he added, \"earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down.\"\r\nBut many bankers were noticeably more optimistic. The word \"recession\" did not come up once on Citigroup's Tuesday earnings calls with analysts. Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, also offered an optimistic vision of the current turmoil."

It slightly pared losses after China said it wants to see a number of steps from the US administration before it agrees to trade talks.\r\n“All this uncertainty and talk of more tariffs is fueling the idea of de-risking from US assets — sell the dollar,” said Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign-exchange strategist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney. “Euro and Swiss franc are prime candidates of that flow, even as the trade war escalates and global growth deteriorates.”\r\nHaven currencies including the Swiss franc and yen rallied earlier alongside the euro while demand for long-volatility exposure surged. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slid as much as 0.6% on Wednesday after rising for the first time in six days on Tuesday.\r\nThe greenback gauge has slumped more than 3% so far in April, on track for its steepest monthly decline since late 2022, amid deepening concerns about a trade war-driven US recession and the dollar’s appeal as a safe haven.\r\n“We see the era of strong dollar as having peaked,” Jefferies International chief economist and strategist Mohit Kumar wrote in a note to clients. “US dollar weakness is likely to continue. Our favorite version of a weaker dollar has been long gold as central banks seek to diversify out of US dollar in alternatives.”\r\nIn another sign of weakening confidence in traditional safe-haven US assets, Treasuries suffered their worst selloff in more than two decades last week due to worries that foreign holders such as China were reducing ownership.\r\nFund managers are the most bearish on the dollar since 2006, according to a Bank of America survey. That sentiment is now spilling into options markets, where traders are paying a premium — for the first time in five years — to hedge against a weaker greenback over the next 12 months.\r\nWhat Bloomberg strategists say...\r\n“The US’s tariff policy, capital outflow, and the assault on the dollar as a politically meddle-free global financial instrument are keeping pressure on the US currency. In this environment, other currencies, such as sterling, are likely to remain overall supported, with weak domestic fundamentals only providing fleeting headwinds, until the dollar looks cheap enough again to attract buyers despite its new risks.”"

This has tipped the buy/sell ratio to 0.40, keeping it near the highest level since late 2023. While corporate executives often buy stock for reasons unrelated to market performance, the uptick in purchases suggests a confidence in their companies that’s reassuring to investors who’ve been battered by the weeks-long selloff.\r\n“This is a positive sign,” said Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management. “Investors are still mired in a negative feedback loop, given trade and economic uncertainty. So it’s pivotal for this trend to continue as the stock market attempts to get its sea legs.”\r\nGrowing optimism from corporate executives stands in contrast to the broader risk-off mood. Investor sentiment regarding economic prospects is the most negative in three decades. Global fund managers are gloomy, with 82% of respondents to a monthly Bank of America global survey expected the global economy to weaken. A record number of them intend to reduce exposure to US equities, according to the poll.\r\nThat’s as investors are dealing with inflation that risks becoming entrenched because of a global trade war and the possibility of a recession. It’s the reason some, like EP Wealth Advisors’ Adam Phillips, are reluctant to overstate the trend of insider share purchases.\r\n“Like so many others, a lot of these companies are flying blind as they await clarity around trade policies,” Phillips, managing director of portfolio strategy at the firm, said.\r\nBuying and selling among corporate executives has a track record of providing an early read on market direction. The insider buy-sell ratio jumped in August 2015 and late 2018, with the former preceding a market bottom and the latter coinciding with one. In March 2020, corporate insiders’ purchases correctly signaled the bottom of a bear-market rout."

But an outgrowth of shifting tariff policies has sparked another lucrative exchange on Wall Street: the volatility trade.\r\nAsurge in trading activityhas shuttled billions of dollars to the nation’s largest banks as investors have attempted to protect their money or deploy it in the face of market gyrations.\r\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo'sTermsandPrivacy Policy\r\nEarnings reports from the big five banksin recent days revealed they collectively raked in nearly $37 billion in trading revenue this past quarter, touting record sales from equities changing hands.\r\nWarren Buffett famously urged investors to “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” A corollary for the financial institutions facilitating those trades is to sit back in any environment and collect fees.\r\nWall Street wants stocks to go up, sure, but most importantly, it just wants stocks to move.\r\nThe big banks' trading may mostly be for hedge funds, pensions, and large companies — big institutional investors. But everyone's rolling up their sleeves at the volatility and tinkering with their portfolios, looking to optimize or take advantage of the moment.\r\nAs my colleagueJosh Schafer reports, everybody's trading. Dip-buying flows following the week of “Liberation Day” reached record levels, according to data from VandaTrack, including $3 billion in net purchases on April 3. That was the largest daily total since VandaTrack began collecting the data in 2014.\r\nBuying at recent lows and FOMO trading explained much of the heightened activity. But another interpretation is that an entire class of retail investor has been trained to throw their cash into stocks in a continuation of a pandemic-era shift in personal finance.\r\nYou are probably better off not looking at your diminished 401(k) account when the market is convulsing. But pushing an order on a trading app has become something of a pastime for an increasingly large American demographic, the foundation for group chats among young people, and the basis for an entire genre of aspirational lifestyle content.\r\nThat big banks' big shot clients are doing this too is a great \"stars, they're just like us\" moment. But it's also part and parcel of the same volatility that's been a hallmark of the 2025 stock market and a lesson in the importance of a diversified portfolio of banks' business lines."

Business leaders are working to manage volatility and an evolving economic environment, as the goalpost keeps moving on policies.\r\nBank of America(BofA) CFO Alastair Borthwick offered some insight into what the bank is hearing from its commercial clients—concerns over trade policy and recent market turmoil have grown. “What our clients are telling us is they're looking for certainty,” Borthwick said during a media call on Tuesday. BofA’s commercial clients range from small businesses to middle-market and large corporations.\r\nThey’re seeking clarity, not just around trade policy, but also the tax package and regulatory reform. “Every day provides a little more information” and also “a little bit more in the way of certainty for people,” he said.\r\nHe added: “It's a slow-growth environment. That's what we continue to try and support our clients through.”\r\nCFOs certainly are grappling withtariff uncertainty. Some aretaking actionssuch as devising alternative-sourcing plans, stockpiling greater inventory, and creating financial buffers.\r\nHowever, BofA's research team at this point doesn't believe we'll see a recession, Borthwick said. And clients continue to show \"encouraging signs.\" Employment remains healthy, and consumers have proven resilient, he said.\r\nFor its Q1, Bank of America reported on Tuesday net income of $7.4 billion and earnings per share of 90 cents, up from 76 cents the same time last year. Revenue growth was 6%. It was driven by net interest income (NII), which was up 3% from the prior year, reaching $14.6 billion, partially helped by lower deposit costs. NII is the difference between what the bank earns on loans and investments and pays out on its liabilities, including deposits.\r\nBofA maintained its guidance that NII will reach $15.5 to $15.7 billion in the fourth quarter and achieve 6% to 7% year-over-year growth for 2025, Borthwick said. This goes against the grain of what’s becoming more common this earnings season—some companies arepulling guidancedue to tariff tumult.\r\n“We run our business to withstand volatility over the short and the long term and through our responsible growth strategy,” Borthwick said on the media call. BofA is prepared to manage through any potential downturn in the economy, he said.\r\nAn analyst asked during BofA’s Q1 earnings call on Tuesday if there will be any potential impacts from the U.S. stock marketlosing trillions in wealthfollowing the announcement of the Trump administration's sweepingtariff policy.\r\nThe real risk in any bank's balance sheet is going to be its credit posture, CEO Brian Moynihan said on the call.

The dollar fell to a fresh six-month low as traders were whiplashed again by a slew of tariff headlines, with Trump launching an investigation into the need for levies on critical minerals.\r\nGold briefly pared gains following a report that China is open to trade talks if the US names a point person to represent the country and shows respect by reining in disparaging remarks, according to a person familiar with the Chinese government’s thinking.\r\nThe precious metal has climbed more than 26% this year and hit a series of record highs as the escalating trade war creates anxiety over a possible global recession and as investors struggle to take long-term positions due to the unpredictability of tariff announcements from Washington.\r\n“I’d love to have a pound for every time someone said it’s a record high in gold in the last few weeks,” Evy Hambro, thematic and sector investing global head at Blackrock Inc., said on Bloomberg Television. “The gold market is kind of thriving in this period of uncertainty, but the foundations are very tangible and real.”\r\nLeading banks remain optimistic about bullion’s prospects over the coming quarters as investors add to holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded funds and central banks continue to accumulate the metal. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is forecasting that prices will rally to $4,000 an ounce by mid-2026.\r\nIn a Bank of America global fund manager survey this week, 42% of respondents expected gold to be the best performing asset class in 2025, up from 23% in March.\r\nNearly half of respondents also thought “long gold” is currently the most crowded trade, knocking “long Magnificent Seven” — which refers to a group of high-performing and influential US companies — off the top position it has held for two years straight.\r\nThe US administration also announced investigations this week into semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports, after placing sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum, automobiles and car parts. It also said it’s negotiating with dozens of other trading partners to lower trade barriers in exchange for relief on higher duties."

      "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) is a Trending Stock",
      "body": "Caterpillar(CAT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\r\nOver the past month, shares of this construction equipment company have returned -13%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Manufacturing - Construction and Mining industry, which Caterpillar falls in, has lost 12%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\r\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\r\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\r\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\r\nCaterpillar is expected to post earnings of $4.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.9%.\r\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.41 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -11.4%. This estimate has changed -1.7% over the last 30 days.\r\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.69 indicates a change of +11.7% from what Caterpillar is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.2%.\r\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Caterpillar."

      "body": "Caterpillarrecently announced a significant executive leadership change, with Joseph E. Creed appointed as the new CEO effective May 1, 2025. This leadership transition, along with adjustments to executive compensation, appears timely with the company's stock seeing a 6% rise last week. This move aligned closely with broader market trends where major indexes were buoyed by tech and bank stocks amid easing U.S.-China trade tensions. Within this context, Caterpillar's announcements likely added positive sentiment, supporting the stock's alignment with the market's upward trajectory, which saw a similar 7% climb over the same period.\r\nWe've identified 2 possible red flags with Caterpillar and understanding the impact should be part of your investment process.\r\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 20 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\r\nThe recent leadership change at Caterpillar, with Joseph E. Creed stepping in as CEO, might further solidify the company's strategic focus on sustainability and growth in alternative fuel markets. This aligns with Caterpillar's ongoing investments in capacity expansion and new technologies, potentially improving long-term revenue growth. While recent executive changes have buoyed short-term sentiment, impacting weekly stock performance positively, the firm's share price also reflects longstanding investor confidence with a total return of 186.72% over the last five years. This context frames a robust performance relative to the broader US market and offers a clear view of its trajectory beyond near-term fluctuations.\r\nAnalysis shows Caterpillar's shares are somewhat discounted compared to the consensus analyst price target of US$365.99, which indicates potential upward movement of over 20%. If the new leadership can successfully navigate near-term challenges such as lower sales volumes and an unfavorable product mix, revenue and earnings forecasts could improve in line with market expectations. A focus on high-margin services and strategic capital deployment could further enhance shareholder returns despite potential revenue pressures in certain sectors. As the company continues to pursue its sustainability goals, any advancements could further align with long-term market trends, potentially justifying current and future valuations.\r\nDive into the specifics of Caterpillar here with our thorough balance sheet health report.\r\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.We provide commentary based on historical data and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your financial situation.

      "body": "Chicago, IL – April 14, 2025 – Zacks Value Trader is a podcast hosted weekly by Zacks Stock Strategist Tracey Ryniec. Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2445093/energy-stocks-take-a-dive-values-or-traps\r\nWelcome to Episode #401 of the Value Investor Podcast.\r\n\r\n(0:15) - Can You Find Value In The Energy Industry or Are They Traps?\r\n(6:30) - Tracey Takes A Deep Dive Into 3 Stocks To Consider For Your Portfolio\r\n(32:20) - Episode Roundup: XOM, CVX, EOG\r\nPodcast@Zacks.com\r\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\r\nIn April 2025, after the Liberation Day tariffs were put into place by the United States, crude oil plunged. WTI traded down to $56 a barrel and has been gyrating between $55 and $65 ever since.\r\nWhile lower oil prices can mean good news for consumers at the pump, it’s bad news for the energy producers who are unhedged and have certain breakeven levels.\r\nThe oil and natural gas stocks have gotten hammered due to falling commodity prices and the uncertainty from the tariff turbulence of 2025. Although oil escaped direct American tariffs.\r\nEnergy companies are lumped into different categories within the oil industry. In this podcast, Tracey talks about “Big Oil” which are the large, integrated oil companies and the American explorers and producers, or the “E & Ps.”\r\nThe Integrated Oil stocks, as an industry, are down just 3.9% year-to-date. But the American E&Ps, as an industry, are now down 27.8% on the year.\r\nThe E&Ps, which do not have refining, chemicals, or other divisions to offset their production, are much more volatile when oil sells off.\r\nJust because a stock sells-off and now has a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, doesn’t mean that it’s a true value in the classical sense of the word.\r\nRemember, a true value stock is cheap on a P/E basis, but also has rising earning estimates.\r\nAre the energy stocks cheap, or just traps?\r\nExxon Mobil is a large American integrated oil company. Shares of Exxon are down 7.1% year-to-date but have finally started sinking in the last month, falling 10.6% in that time.\r\nExxon appears cheap with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.1. The 2025 Zacks Consensus Estimate is looking for $7.13 but that’s 8.5% under the $7.79 Exxon made last year. One earnings estimate has been revised higher for 2025 and 2 lower in the last week."

      "title": "Chevron's Venezuela Oil Exports Stalled by PDVSA Amid Sanctions",
      "body": "Chevron Corporation’s CVX operations in Venezuela have hit a major roadblock as state-owned oil firm PDVSA abruptly canceled export authorizations for several of its vessels due to payment uncertainty amid the hardening of U.S. sanctions on the OPEC-member country. This move has left at least two tankers loaded with Venezuelan crude stranded at the port. In contrast, four others were forced to depart empty, indicating a significant intensification in the U.S.-Venezuela energy standoff.\r\nThe turmoil follows the Trump administration’s recent decision to revoke Chevron’s license to operate in Venezuela. Although the license was set to expire with a wind-down period ending May 27, PDVSA has begun enforcing restrictions ahead of schedule. These actions have derailed the company’s plans to export oil, even for cargoes that were already loaded and awaiting departure.\r\nTwo Chevron-chartered tankers, named Dubai Attraction and Carina Voyage, remained idle in Venezuelan waters, pending authorization to return their cargoes. These shipments had been formally declared to Venezuela’s customs authority, and now require new clearance to be unloaded or rerouted. Meanwhile, four other Chevron vessels — Pegasus Star, Ionic Anax, Calypso and Sea Jaguar — were denied loading access altogether.\r\nCarina Voyager was en route to Chevron's Pascagoula refinery in Mississippi, while Dubai Attraction was slated to transfer its cargo to the Valero Energy-chartered tanker, Cap Corpus Christi, near Aruba. However, the Cap Corpus Christi departed for the United States on Friday only partially loaded, as it was unable to complete the ship-to-ship transfer.\r\nThe Venezuelan vice president placed the blame entirely on U.S. sanctions. In a Telegram post, the nation cited that Chevron, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), was not able to pay PDVSA due to the U.S.-driven economic war, thus prompting the return of crude shipments. The shipments are now being rerouted to other international markets, suggesting Venezuela’s intention to gain some alternative buyers.\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\nChevron’s joint ventures in Venezuela produce roughly 25% of the country’s total oil output, which reached an average of 250,000 barrels per day to the United States in early 2025. The sudden halt in its exports not only jeopardizes this flow but also threatens to deepen Venezuela’s economic and political isolation."

However, the trends in March are not so different from what's happening now, as consumer sentiment was rapidly weakening and fears of a recession were mounting before thetariffannouncement.\r\nLet's take a look at the two best-performingDow Jones Industrial Average(^DJI-1.73%)companies to see if they're worth buying today.\r\nImage source: Getty Images.\r\nUnitedHealth Group(UNH0.30%)is one of the most resilient stocks on the market. Healthcare is considered a recession-proof industry, but health insurance is even more unaffected by the economy because people need coverage regardless.\r\nIt's not a surprise, then, that investors have piled into the stock in March and have continued to do so through the tariff-related chaos of April.\r\nThere was no major company-specific news out on UnitedHealth in March, and investors seem to be returning to the stock after it tumbled following the assassination of one of its executives in December 2024.\r\nUnitedHealth has been one of the rare winners on the stock market in April, gaining 15% thanks to a 5.06% increase in Medicare Advantage benchmarks and its reputation as a port in a storm during turbulent market times.\r\nChevron(CVX0.65%)might seem like a surprise on this list as the energy sector is typically highly sensitive to the economic cycle.\r\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Chevron will continue to be sensitive to the health of the global economy and oil prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inUnitedHealth Group, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andUnitedHealth Groupwasn’t one of them.

      "body": "OPEC and its allies have revised their oil demand projectionsdownward for both 2025 and 2026, citing mounting global trade tensions and tariffs as key risks to economic growth.\r\nThe group now expects global crude demand to rise by 1.3 million barrels per day over the next two years roughly 150,000 barrels per day lower than previous forecasts. OPEC+ also adjusted its global GDP growth outlook, trimming expectations to 3% for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026, each down by 0.1 percentage point.\r\nThe global economy showed a steady growth trend at the beginning of the year, the organization said in its monthly oil market report. However, recent trade-related dynamics have introduced higher uncertainty to the short-term global economic growth outlook.\r\nAmong the factors behind the downgrade, OPEC+ pointed to U.S. President Donald Trump's newly imposed 145% tariffs on China the world's largest crude oil importer as a significant headwind for energy demand.\r\nDespite the lowered outlook, the oil-producing bloc has agreed to ramp up output starting in May. Analysts warn this move could flood the market with excess supply at a time when consumption is weakening.\r\nSince the tariff announcement on April 2, oil prices have fallen sharply. Brent crude is currently trading around $64.68 per barrel, down 13% since the start of the month and off another 1% on April 14.\r\nMajor oil producers have not been spared. Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Shell (NYSE:SHEL), and BP (NYSE:BP) have all seen their shares drop over 10% in the past month.\r\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\r\nKey Points\r\nOil prices have tumbled this year. WTI, the primary U.S. oil price benchmark, has plunged from about $80 a barrel in early January to around $60 a barrel. The culprit has been the concern that tariffs will slow the global economy, driving down demand for crude oil.\r\nLower crude prices will impact oil company cash flows. However, someoil stocksarein a better positionto navigate the lower oil prices than others due to theirabundantlow-cost oil resources. Three oil companies that can still thrive in the current environment areDevon Energy(DVN2.65%),ConocoPhillips(COP0.69%), andChevron(CVX0.65%).\r\nDevon Energy has a premier multibasin U.S. onshore resource portfolio. The company produces oil and gas from the Rockies, Delaware Basin, Anadarko Basin, and Eagle Ford. That diversification helps reduce risk and enhances its long-term growth profile.\r\nThe Delaware Basin, which runs through west Texas and southeast New Mexico, is the crown jewel of Devon Energy's portfolio. The company gets 56% of its production from that world-class oil resource. That position will fuel the oil company for years to come. Devon has thousands of remaining drilling locations with an average breakeven level of $40 per barrel. Because of that, it can still make a lot of money drilling in the region at the current oil price point.\r\nThe company's low-cost resources position it to produce a lot of cash even in the current environment. Devon was on track to make over $3 billion in free cash flow this year when WTI was above $70 a barrel during the first quarter. While that number will decline if crude remains around $60, Devon will still produce a lot of excess cash this year. It plans to return about 70% of that money to shareholders via its dividend and share repurchases, retaining the rest to strengthen its already rock-solid balance sheet.\r\nConocoPhillips has a global portfolio of low-cost resources. The company held about 20 billionbarrels of oil equivalentresources with a supply cost below $40 a barrel for WTI. It added even more low-cost resources last year when it acquired Marathon Oil. That deal topped off its tank by adding more than 2 billion barrels of resources with an averagecost of supplybelow $30 per barrel for WTI.\r\nThe company's low-cost resources position it to produce a lot of cash in the current environment. ConocoPhillips initially expected to generate enough excess free cash flow this year to return $10 billion to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. While lower oil prices will impact the amount of excess free cash flow it produces this year, itcould still achieve that capital return target thanks to its cash-rich balance sheet. ConocoPhillips ended last year with $6.4 billion of cash and short-term investments and another $1 billion of long-term investments. Meanwhile, it'sworking toward generating an additional $2 billion in cash via non-core asset sales.\r\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is818%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\r\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now…\r\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\r\nChevron has a globally integrated energy business. That integration between upstream (oil and gas production) and downstream (refining and chemicals) helps mute some of theimpactof lower oil prices. The company also has a very low-cost global resource portfolio.\r\nThe energy giant has stress-tested its business for lower oil prices. Chevron forecasts that it can produce enough cash flow from operations to cover its high-yielding dividend (currently over 5%) and capital spending program at $50 oil through 2027 with room to spare. Meanwhile, the company has the balance sheet capacity to buy back shares at the low end of its $10 billion-$20 billion annual target range during that period at that price point.\r\nChevron is working to further enhance its low-cost resource portfolio by acquiringHess. The deal would add a world-class position in offshore Guyana and other high-quality assets to diversify and enhance Chevron's portfolio. It would further bolster the company's low-cost supplies, putting it in an even stronger position to thrive duringperiods oflower oil prices.\r\nThe recent downdraft in crude prices will impact the cash flows that oil companies produce. However, Devon Energy, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron haveverylow-cost operations and strong balance sheets. Because of that, they can still thrive at lower prices by producing lots of cash that they can return to investors through dividends and share repurchases. That makes them lower-risk ways to invest in the oil patch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inDevon Energy, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andDevon Energywasn’t one of them.

But there are two interesting things about this company. First, it is run kind of like a mutual fund. Second, it doesn't pay dividends despite the fact that Buffett often invests in dividend-paying companies. Here's why that matters and why you might want to buy one of these three dividend payers he owns.\r\nOne of the core tenets ofBuffett's investment approachis to buy good companies when they are attractively priced. But the next step is to hold for the long term so he can benefit from the growth of the businesses he buys. One of the nuances that gets lost in this is that he uses the cash generated from the companies he owns outright or owns in Berkshire Hathaway's common stock portfolio to reinvest in his business. That allows him to compound those cash flows over time and this enhances the returns he generates for investors.\r\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\r\nFrom a big-picture perspective, you can do the same thing bydividend reinvesting. All it takes is a phone call to your broker, or, more likely, a button press on your broker's website or in its app. And in one quick and easy move you'll be investing more like Warren Buffett.\r\nBut what if you want to invest even more like Oracle of Omaha? Well, three dividend-paying stocks he owns today areCoca-Cola(KO-0.19%),Chevron(CVX0.65%), andKraft Heinz(KHC-2.00%). Here's a look at these three Buffett stocks to see if they'll be a good fit for your Buffett style dividend reinvesting.\r\nCoca-Cola is a very easy company to like. It is the industry-leading beverage company with a globally diversified business. It is large enough to have economies of scale in distribution, marketing, and research and development, and it can, and does, act as an industry consolidator. The dividend has been increased annually for over five decades, making ita Dividend King. The dividend yield is 2.9%, which is well above the market's yield today.\r\nFor conservative dividend investors it is a solid choice. The only problem is that the stock looks a little expensive at the moment, with both the price-to-sales andprice-to-earningsratios above their five-year averages. However, if you are willing to pay a premium for income security, Coca-Cola could be a good fit for your portfolio.\r\nAnother industry leader in Buffett's portfolio isenergygiant Chevron. It is one of the largest integrated energy companies you can buy, with a business that spans from the upstream (energy production) through the midstream (pipelines) and into the downstream (chemicals and refining). This diversification helps to soften the impact of the inherent swings in the commodity-driven energy sector. On top of that, the company has a very strong balance sheet, which allows it to take on leverage during industry downturns to support its business and dividend.\r\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is818%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\r\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now…\r\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\r\nThe dividend, notably, has been increased annually for 38 years thanks largely to Chevron's solid business model. That said, energy price volatility still has a material impact on the stock price. Right now energy prices are weakening andthe dividend yieldis a very attractive 4.7%. The yield could go higher if oil prices continue to fall. But the history here suggests that the dividend will continue to get paid even if oil prices continue to fall. You could try to time your entry into Chevron, but the truth is it is a strong energy choice at just about any point of the energy cycle.\r\nThe last big dividend stock on this list is Kraft Heinz. It is a toughconsumer staples stockto love when you compare it to Coca-Cola. Yes, Kraft Heinz's dividend yield is a lofty 5.3%, but the dividend has been static since it was cut in 2019. The big story is the business overhaul that's taking place.\r\nThe company was created via the merger between Kraft and Heinz. The goal at that time was to cut costs to boost profitability. But cutting costs can only take a company so far before it needs to refocus on growth. That's what Kraft Heinz has been doing, after turning to a new management team. But the results haven't been particularly impressive, which is why the dividend has been stuck in neutral for so long. If you consider this high-yield food maker you'll need to go in understanding that it is aturnaroundstory that will require extra monitoring. It's probably only appropriate for more aggressive investors.\r\nWhile Buffett owns Coca-Cola, Chevron, and Kraft Heinz in his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, you don't actually need to own these specific stocks to benefit from dividend reinvestment. These are just three stocks to get you thinking about the real investment tool that's important here, which is the reinvestment of dividends so you can compound your returns over time -- just like Buffett does with his investments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inChevron, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andChevronwasn’t one of them.

      "body": "We recently published a list of the11 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other undervalued energy stocks.\r\nOn March 18, Tortoise Capital senior portfolio manager Rob Thummel appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ to discuss his outlook on the energy sector. He believes that natural gas is positioned to lead growth in the future within the energy sector. This natural gas demand is driven by electricity and energy exports. Thummel noted that the energy and tech sectors are converging due to advancements like AI and data centers. Electricity demand fuels natural gas consumption, while US energy exports help meet global needs for low-cost and low-carbon energy. He also highlighted that the US is now emerging as the largest exporter of LNG, even though it was an LNG importer just years ago. He anticipates that the US LNG exports will soon 2x in volume over time. Thummel also expects Europe and other countries to prioritize energy security and diversify their supply sources. This will ensure reliance on US energy exports.\r\nThummel emphasized a focus on energy infrastructure companies while discussing his specific investment strategies as they tend to be stable and have high dividend yields even in uncertain market conditions. He thinks that the certainty provided by energy infrastructure investments in an otherwise volatile market should not be neglected. Such companies generate substantial annual cash flows while maintaining disciplined financial practices.\r\nThummel thinks that the energy sector trades at a discount to historical valuations despite its fundamentals. This offers the potential for high returns.\r\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top energy stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15 as of April 10. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers.\r\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here)."

      "title": "OPEC Revises Oil Demand Outlook Amid Shifting Market Trends",
      "body": "The latest monthly report from OPEC shows that the cartel has revised its global oil demand growth forecast for 2025 downward for the first time since December, now projecting an increase of 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) — 150,000 bpd less than previous estimates. The revision stems largely from slower-than-expected consumption and new U.S. tariffs that have rattled trade dynamics and economic sentiment globally. As President Trump ramps up tariff measures, including a 125% levy on Chinese imports, investors are growing increasingly wary about how this might dampen energy demand, particularly in emerging markets.Despite these geopolitical headwinds, oil prices remain relatively steady, with WTI crude hovering over $60 per barrel. However, volatility is high. Crude futures are down more than 10% so far this month, largely on fears that slowing global trade and rising supply will pressure prices. Against this backdrop, it may be wise for investors to adopt a more defensive approach—one that focuses on large, resilient players likeChevronCVX,ConocoPhillipsCOP, andEOG ResourcesEOG. These companies have the scale, balance sheets, and capital discipline to navigate turbulence, making them safer bets in uncertain times.\r\nOPEC’s cautious tone isn’t just based on oil-specific fundamentals. The group’s Monthly Oil Market Report also trimmed its global economic growth outlook for 2025 to 3.0%, from 3.1%, reflecting growing uncertainty in light of the ongoing trade tensions. The U.S. economy is forecasted to expand by 2.1% in 2025, while growth in the Eurozone and China is expected to slow to 0.8% and 4.6%, respectively. These projections imply weaker industrial activity and transport fuel demand—the key drivers of global oil consumption.OECD nations are forecast to contribute a mere 40,000 bpd to demand growth in 2025, while non-OECD countries, traditionally the growth engine, are expected to add around 1.25 million bpd. However, these numbers could fall if trade tensions and inflation continue to hurt energy use by consumers and businesses.\r\nOn the supply front, OPEC’s report showed that the broader OPEC+ group reduced output slightly in March, with total production falling by 37,000 bpd to 41.02 million bpd. Cuts from Nigeria and Iraq offset gains from Kazakhstan, which continues to exceed its output cap. However, OPEC+ is scheduled to increase output again in May, raising questions about how the additional barrels will be absorbed in a softer demand environment.Meanwhile, non-OPEC supply growth has also been revised down. OPEC now expects non-OPEC+ liquids production to rise by 900,000 bpd in 2025—100,000 bpd less than previously forecast. Most of this increase is still expected to come from the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. However, with U.S. shale growth slowing and cost inflation a growing concern, the global supply outlook looks slightly more balanced than a month ago."

      "title": "Chevron Corporation (CVX)  Among the Best Oil Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaires",
      "body": "We recently published a list of the10 Best Oil Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other best oil stocks.\r\nAfter an encouraging start to the year, the energy sector is once again lagging behind the overall market. At the time of writing this piece, the broader energy sector has slid by almost 8.2% since the beginning of 2025, against declines of around 7.9% by the wider market. The principal reason behind this fall is the decline in the global prices of oil, which have plunged by almost 14.5% since the beginning of the year.\r\nREAD NEXT:10 Best Clean Energy Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires\r\nThe continued uncertainty surrounding the ongoing tariff war and the recent decision by OPEC+ to increase supply in May have taken a toll on the global price, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price now hovering around a 3-year low of $61.5. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecasted WTI price to average $63.88 per barrel for 2025 before dropping to an average of $57.48 next year. Such a sharp decline in prices could threaten US oil production growth this year. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the US oil industry needs prices between $61 and $70 per barrel to be profitable.\r\nThe escalating trade tensions between the US and China have also raised the prospect of a global economic slowdown, potentially leading to a lower-than-forecasted consumption of oil. In its latest report, the EIA now expects global oil consumption to increase by 900,000 b/d in 2025 and 1 million b/d in 2026, down by 400,000 b/d and 100,000 b/d, respectively, from its initial forecast last month. The decrease in demand, coupled with increasing production, will continue putting pressure on crude prices, forcing many industry players to cut back activity to maintain investor payouts.\r\nThe American oil and gas sector is also frustrated by the back and forth trade policies of President Trump and is questioning how they align with his ‘drill, baby, drill’ mandate to further boost production. According to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, nearly a third of oil executives have stated that their business outlook has worsened since the end of 2024. Moreover, the imposition of the 25% tariff on steel and aluminum has already led to an estimated 4% increase in costs for drilling a well.\r\nThe pressing issues surrounding the global oil trade have forced the industry to shift focus to its second major source of revenue – natural gas. In contrast to oil, the benchmark US natural gas price at Henry Hub has surged by more than 123% since last year and by almost 18% since the beginning of 2025. The uptick comes as a result of slowing output in 2024, booming LNG exports, and fast-depleting inventories during the coldest winter in six years. Moreover, natural gas has emerged as a leading candidate to power the ongoing AI boom and its accompanying data centers, with many providers now even aiming to surpass utilities and supply directly to these power-hungry facilities."

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\r\nKey Points\r\nMany companies reward shareholders by passing along a portion of profits through dividends. But oftentimes, the dividend yield on a stock might not be much to write home about. Many growth-focused companies don't pay dividends at all, which is why the yield on theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)has fallen to just 1.4%.\r\nHowever, there are some companies that yield a considerable amount -- to the point where the dividend is a core part of the investment thesis. Stocks with reliable dividends and high yields can be excellent ways to collect passive income no matter what the broader market is doing.\r\nHere's why these three fool.com contributors thinkChevron(CVX0.65%),Brookfield Renewable Partners(BEP-0.90%)(BEPC-1.05%), andMSC Industrial Direct(MSM-1.48%)are three high-yielddividend stocksto buy now.\r\nImage source: Getty Images.\r\nDaniel Foelber(Chevron):Chevron stock is hovering around a three-year low. The sell-off in the integrated oil major could be a phenomenal buying opportunity for income investors.\r\nThe company has raised its dividend for38 consecutive years,an impressive track record considering multiple oil and gas downturns and recessions have occurred during that period. The sell-off in the stock has pushed its yield up to 4.8%, providing investors with the opportunity to generate sizable passive income.\r\nAnd Chevron has an excellent balance sheet that acts as a cushion in case of a prolonged oil and gas downturn. The company has used outsize profits in recent years to pay down debt and return cash to investors through buybacks and dividends. It has just $17.2 billion in net long-term debt and an ultra-lowdebt-to-capital ratioof just 13.6%, showcasing how its capital structure isn't dependent on debt.\r\nDespite its strengths, Chevron will probably generate a lot less free cash flow (FCF) if oil prices stay at lower levels (they are at their lowest level in four years). And although the company has reduced its cost of production over time, there comes a point when it can no longer support its dividend and capital-spending plans with cash.\r\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is818%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\r\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now…\r\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\r\nAt current oil prices, management will likely pull back on capital spending and buybacks, but it still has a margin for error considering 75% of its oil investments canbreak even below $50 per barrel. The company has been testing its new \"triple frac\" technology, which could reduce costs and cut completion times for new wells in the Permian Basin.\r\nAnother advantage of Chevron over other producers is its geographic diversification. It isn't dependent on one region and has a massive refining business and growing low-carbon segment.\r\nThe company has what it takes to generate positive FCF even at lower oil prices and support its growing dividend. In past downturns, it has pulled back on stock repurchases and spending but continued to support the dividend by leaning on its balance sheet.\r\nIf oil prices fall below $50 per barrel, many companies would be in dire straits. But the business has proved time and time again that investors can count on it for passive income even during downturns.\r\nAdd it all up, and Chevron is as safe a bet as you'll find in the oil patch.\r\nScott Levine(Brookfield Renewable Partners):With markets turning in topsy-turvy performances right now, many investors are eager for some stability. At the forefront of the many ways that they can gird themselves, buying reliable dividend stocks like green energy specialistBrookfield Renewable Partnersis a savvy choice. The limited partnership currently offers an enticing 7.3% forward yield.\r\nProviding an ultra-high yield, Brookfield might spark doubt in investors who question whether the company can sustain its generous payout during the current market downturn. But that's the allure: With its stable business model, the company enjoys tremendous resilience during times like these.\r\nFrom solar to wind to other green energy assets, Brookfield Renewable Partners operates a massive global green energy portfolio -- about 46 gigawatts of operating capacity -- and it inks long-term deals with customers, which agree to purchase the generated power.\r\nThis model ensures that the company will continue generating revenue, and it will have the resources to continue rewarding investors. In its fourth-quarter 2024 financial results, for example, management noted that about 90% of the company's generation capacity is contracted, and about 70% of its revenue is protected from inflation.\r\nIn its relatively short time as a publicly held company, it has demonstrated steadfast dedication to returning capital to investors, further illustrating its appeal. Every year since its initial public offering in 2011, the company has hiked its dividend by at least 5%. Regarding the years ahead, management has stated a goal of continuing to boost its dividend 5% to 9% annually.\r\nFor income-hungry investors, now's a great time to buy Brookfield Renewable Partners' stock, which is currently trading at a discount to its historical valuation.\r\nLee Samaha(MSC Industrial Direct):It's incredibly challenging to know whether the White Houe tariffs are tactical (to aid trade-deal negotiations) or strategic (to engineer a long-term structural shift in the global economy), but it's probably true to think they are a bit of both.\r\nHowever, one thing we do know with a high degree of certainty is that President Donald Trump, one way or another, wants to see the U.S. rebuild its industrial base. That could be great news for metalworking supply company MSC Industrial.\r\nReaders should be under no illusions: If the current uncertainty persists, there's a serious risk of an industrial recession, and MSC Industrial will inevitably suffer the consequences.\r\nHowever, the long-term outlook is brighter, as a shift in manufacturing back to the U.S. implies an improving environment for metalworking suppliers. The company has negative exposure to tariffs via 10% of its cost of goods sold from China, with a similar amount from Europe, and low-single-digit percentages from Canada and Mexico.\r\nOn a positive note, distributors like MSC will try to pass on the tariff increases in pricing. In any case, most of its products are sourced in the U.S. All told, if you are confident that the global economy will avoid a recession and that the president's determination to reinvigorate the industrial base will work, then MSC Industrial is a good choice for long-term investors.\r\nJust be aware that the near-term risk is rising while companies set about reshaping their supply chains and product sourcing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inChevron, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andChevronwasn’t one of them.

      "title": "Petrobras' Environmental Hurdles Lead to Oil Blocks Auction in Brazil",
      "body": "Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. – Petrobras’PBR years-long disputes with the environmental authorities on drilling licenses recently led to an oil block auction, whereby Brazil’s oil regulator, ANP, will provide exploration rights in several offshore oil blocks.\r\nThe auction, which is scheduled to take place on June 17, will offer 172 blocks spanning both land and deep-water zones in northeastern and southern Brazil, including the Equatorial Margin — a region that could be key to Brazil’s energy future. The blocks across five sedimentary basins, including the deepwater Potiguar and Foz do Amazonas, located near the equator, will also be offered, which are considered to hold Brazil’s greatest potential for replenishing reserves and are projected to start declining by 2030.\r\nOut of the 172 oil blocks, 47 are at the Foz do Amazonas, where Petrobras, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold),won the exploration deal in 2023 and since then, has been awaiting environmental clearance to drill its first well. These oil blocks are expected to contain the same potential as those in Suriname and Guyana, where Exxon Mobil found billions of barrels of oil. The delay in environmental clearance certainly reduces the attractiveness of these blocks for the auction.\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\nCertain environmental working groups have suggested dropping some Potiguar Basin oil blocks, like Atol das Rocas and the Fernando de Noronha archipelago as they are in places of extreme environmental sensitivity and ecosystem connectivity.\r\nHowever, Brazil’s several ministries jointly allowed these sensitive areas to be offered for auction, even though this authorization expires just a day after the auction. This puts the Potiguar Basin at particular risk of exclusion from future rounds.\r\nDespite the controversies, the auction has attracted interest from the industry’s big players. Thirty-one companies have registered themselves to bid for the upcoming auction, including Petrobras,Exxon Mobil CorporationXOM,Chevron CorporationCVX,BP p.l.c.BP,Shell and Equinor.\r\nExxon Mobil is a U.S.-based oil and gas giant that has a track record of optimal capital structure and Capex discipline across the commodity price cycle, making it a low-risk energy player producing industry-leading returns. XOM’s expected growth rate for earnings per share for the next year is 21.88%, which aligns favorably with the industry growth rate of 16.30%."

      "title": "Chevron or ExxonMobil  Which Big Oil Leads the Permian Charge ",
      "body": "ChevronCVX andExxonMobilXOM are two of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. The Permian Basin has become a linchpin for both as they sharpen their focus on scalable, high-return assets. Each company is doubling down on this prolific region serving as a key source of cash flow, but their paths diverge in strategy and execution.\r\nAccording to the Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), U.S. crude oil production, largely driven by the Permian, is expected to reach 13.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2025 and 13.6 million bpd in 2026. With Permian output set to grow by 290,000 bpd this year from 2024 and an additional 170,000 bpd in 2026, the region will account for nearly half of the nation’s oil supply, solidifying its role in the energy market. This surge in production is backed by record-breaking rig efficiency, robust infrastructure and continued investments in drilling innovations, ensuring long-term sustainability and profitability for key players in the basin.\r\nChevron holds 1.78 million net acres in the Delaware and Midland sub-basins of Texas and New Mexico, making it one of the largest leaseholders in the Permian. It boosts efficiency by drilling several horizontal wells from a single site, a method known as factory-style development. In 2024, Chevron’s average daily output from the Permian basin stood at 405,000 barrels of oil, 251,000 barrels of NGLs, and 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas.Chevron aims to reach 1 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (BOE/d) in 2025 and is already close, producing 992,000 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2024. With layered rock formations, upgraded infrastructure, and sustainability steps like using electric fleets and solar energy, Chevron’s strategy focuses on both growth and reducing environmental impact.Meanwhile, ExxonMobil has aggressively ramped up its Permian presence through acquisitions — most notably its $63 billion buyout of Pioneer Natural Resources in 2024. This move expanded Exxon’s footprint to more than 1.3 million net acres and significantly boosted output. In 2024, ExxonMobil’s Permian production averaged 1.185 million BOE/d, up 570,000 from the prior year. The company plans to double that to 2.3 million BOE/d by 2030. To get there, it’s using advanced methods like special proppants and cube drilling, and it aims to cut emissions to net zero in its original Permian operations by 2030 and in Pioneer’s by 2035."

At Morgan Stanley, Mike Wilson cut his 2025 earnings-per-share forecast to $257 from $271.\r\n“The 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs and further concessions over the weekend lessen the near-term probability of a recession, but uncertainty remains high,” said Wilson, who sees the S&P 500 trading in a range from 5,000-5,500. The index finished last week at 5,363.36.\r\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) has fallen 8.8% this year on concern that investors increasingly are shifting away from US assets. The selloff was worsened by Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs policy and the tit-for-tat spat with China. Investors are rushing to game out how the effective freezing of Chinese trade will impact companies and growth.\r\nMorgan Stanley’s Wilson warned that the S&P 500 could slump back below 5,000 and retest last week’s lows if 10-year Treasuries yields surge above 5% from the current 4.46%.

If anything, Trump is extending the uncertainty that has already begun to drag on business and consumer sentiment.\r\n“No doubt, the goldilocks sentiment in place entering this year has given way to abject uncertainty,” Chronert wrote in a note. “This is for good reason as the Trump administration’s announced tariff approach is set to disrupt” a global trade system that has developed since China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001.\r\nCompanies’ attempts to pass through tariff-driven price increases threaten the US consumers’ incomes, who’s spending power has already been sapped by post-pandemic inflation."

It was a tough month all around, as 98 of the S&P 500 stocks finished the month down at least 10%, but two especially had a bad month:Delta Air Lines(DAL-0.47%)andUnited Airlines(UAL-0.01%). Delta and United were theS&P 500'sworst-performing stocks in March, falling 27.5% and 26.4%, respectively.\r\n\r\n^SPXdata byYCharts\r\nBroader economic uncertainty took its toll on both companies, but there were also industry-specific problems that caused the stock price drops. Delta lowered itsrevenue growth guidancefrom 6%-8% down to 5% (at the higher end). It also cut itsearnings-per-share(EPS) guidance from $0.70 to $1 down to $0.30 to $0.50.\r\nUnited also lowered its guidance as it projects its revenue will take a hit. It noted a slowdown in corporate and government travel, especially as the federal government focuses on reducing its spending. United says government-related booking decreased by half.\r\nAs new tariff plans go into effect and concerns about inflation and apotential recessionramp up, both companies could face some near-term troubles as consumers, companies, and governments cut back on travel. It will take time to see how it all plays out, but investors should expect volatility to continue along with potential drops.\r\nAs of market closing on April 11, Delta's and United's stocks are down 30.8% and 31.3% for the year, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inDelta Air Lines, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andDelta Air Lineswasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool money starts now.\r\nFrom fool Global headquarters. This is Motley Fool Money. It's the Motley Fool Money Radio Show. I'm Ron Gross sitting in for Dylan Lewis. Joining me today, our senior analyst, Emily Flippen and Matt Argersinger fools, how you doing?\r\nMatt Argersinger:Ron.\r\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is818%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\r\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now…\r\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\r\nEmily Flippen:Doing all right.\r\nMatt Argersinger:Doing all right.\r\nRon Gross:Glad to hear it. Today, we're going to talk banks and assorted spirits, but we must, once again, begin with the big macro and, oh, boy, what a week it has been following several very rough days in the stock market, on Wednesday, the Trump administration put a 90-day pause on its so-called reciprocal tariff policy, sending the market soaring for its biggest one day gain since 2008. Then, on Thursday, inflation data came in tamer than expected and just for good measure, on Thursday, we saw another sell-off in stocks. Emily, I am truly exhausted. But let's dig in. Where are we now from an economic markets perspective? I know you don't have a crystal ball, but where do you think we're going?\r\nEmily Flippen:If financial media has anything to say about it, it's straight to hell on a handbasket here for American consumers and investors. I'm teasing here because I really don't necessarily think that is going to be the case. While we still have a lot of economic data that is not coming out as favorably as I think some investors want, and that's leading to some of that volatility we're seeing in the market, the earlier inflation metrics that we got earlier this week, we're actually very encouraging. It was a sign that some of the concerns that I think we had around stagflation may be coming down a bit. Now, that is the core PPI, the producer price index that excludes food and energy, but it's the Fed's favored inflation metric here. That actually fell nominally month over month.\r\nAnd it wasn't just a matter of, Okay, this is lower than expected, but still rising inflation, but an actual month-over-month decline here. Of course, if we add food and energy, the story changes. But this is a little bit of a silver lining that I think investors need to say, OK, we have a lot of data that's pointing in the wrong direction right now. Here is something that continues to say, it may not be as bad as we expect. But of course, the emphasis is, of course, on this was the case. Inflation metrics are a lagging indicator. We're always forward-looking. Some of the policies that we've seen since this data has come out over the course of the past month, I think, are pretty clearly indicating that inflation is expected to heat up substantially. But I'll take this when for this week.\r\nRon Gross:What about from the markets? Do you think the markets are just nervous, don't like uncertainty? That's what we typically say. Markets hate uncertainty, and there's so much uncertainty around here nowadays. Do you think that's why we're seeing the volatile the big sharp moves?\r\nEmily Flippen:I don't think it's just uncertainty. I think there's genuine concern about the business impacts that these tariffs, if they stay in place, will have both on companies that are supplying, manufacturing, as well as consumers looking to make purchases. This has wide-ranging implications for the performance of the broader economy as a whole. It's not just a matter of uncertainty because I think if we came out tomorrow and said, Okay, we are certain, 100% sure. The tariffs, as they are today, are going to stick this way for the next 12 months for certain, for example. That would be certainty. But I'll tell you what, I bet the stock market would sell off.\r\nRon Gross:Oh. Understood. Matt, US consumer sentiment is now worse than during the Great Recession. New data just came out. Anything here for an individual investor to do other than sit back and just watch it unfold?\r\nMatt Argersinger:Sitting back is very good advice. Watching it unfold, I don't know. You're better off just turning everything off and maybe going away for a week. But look, we're investors. I know that's impossible. It's definitely impossible for me. But here's what I think if you're an investor, what you can or should pay attention to, and that is interest rates. The Trump administration only really blinked this past week when the 10 yield crossed about 4.5%. But guess where we are today as we tape on Friday, back above 4.5%, Ron. If you go back to April 2nd, which was Liberation Day, as the administration called it, the 10-year was just above 4%. We're up 50 basis points in a week, and that's through all this market dislocation. It usually doesn't work that way. Usually, investors are buying treasuries as a safe haven during times like this. That's just not happening right now and I think that is where the real danger lies, and I think Emily hinted at this.\r\nI mean, if countries like China and, Japan UK, various members of the EU stop buying our treasuries, either because they're exporting less as a result of these tariffs, and they don't have as many US dollars to invest anyway, or much worse, guys, they willfully decide to stop buying treasuries in favor of other safe-haven assets or currencies. I mean, just look at the Swiss franc as of the past week. If that happens, it will almost certainly send treasury yields much higher. And I think that would spell huge trouble for the housing market, which we already know is suffering from high mortgage rates. Imagine mortgage rates not at six or 7% as they are now, but 8, 9, 10%. I think it also spells big trouble for small, midsize businesses who don't have as much flexibility with their balance sheets and where they source their products. It's bad for auto manufacturers, bad for commercial real estate and then to consumers to Emily's point. Consumers are sitting on record credit card debt and if interest rates move higher that situation gets a lot worse. I think it really could mean bad news for the economy. If you're going to watch anything at all, sit back and watch this shake out, watch treasury yields. If they keep moving higher, I expect that could trigger a response by the administration. To be less aggressive with these tariffs, maybe come to the table, that'll be the trigger point.\r\nRon Gross:I was going to say one silver lining may be we do have anecdotal evidence that the administration does keep an eye on the bond market, and on interest rates, that could very well be the reason we got the 90 day pause. We don't necessarily have proof of that, but that certainly could be. I would encourage them to keep an eye on the yields, so we don't get into too much trouble, as you outlined. But speaking of interest rates, on Friday, many of the larger banks reported pretty solid results for the first quarter, and Matt, lots of data, plenty of commentary from the CEOs. What's set out to you in these reports?\r\nMatt Argersinger:Results you said, Ron, the results were actually really solid. The problem is no one really cares about that right now. It's really all about guidance and how these CEOs are thinking about the environment, post tariffs, post-liberation Day and what they see going forward. Here's what they're saying. If you look at CEO Jamie Diamond, CEO of the largest US bank,JP Morgan, he's been pretty vocal this past week about the dangers of tariffs, even saying he believes that a recession is all but unavoidable now. And then he said this after his bank reported quarter results, \"The economy is facing considerable turbulence, potential negatives of tariffs and trade wars,\" ongoing sticking inflation, high fiscal deficits, and still rather high asset prices and volatilities.\r\nWhat else he said?Wells Fargo's CEO, Charlie Sharf, \"We support the administration's willingness to look at barriers to fair trade to the United States. Though there are certainly risks associated with such significant actions, a timely resolution, which benefits the US, would be good for businesses, consumers, and the markets. We expect continued volatility and uncertainty and are prepared for a slower economic environment in 2025\" Then Larry Fink, CEO ofBlackrock, which I think is now the world's largest ass manager, \"The sweeping tariff announcements went further than I could have imagined in my 49 years in finance.\" Then in an interview on CNBC, he also said, \"I think we're very close if not in a recession now,\" talking about, of course, the US economy.\r\nRon Gross:Thanks for cheering us up, Matt.\r\nMatt Argersinger:Well, there you go. Let me sum it up, too. These tarifs are dangerous. If not resolved quickly, the risks are high, expect continued uncertainty, which we keep talking about, and we may already be in a recession. Remember, these are the banks and financial institutions that have a pulse, I think, in a lot of areas of the economy, which is from housing to credit, consumer spending. Wait until we start hearing from industrial companies or consumer discretionary companies, especially those that make and sell products all around the world. What will be their reactions and guidance when they report in the coming weeks? I think this is just the first Salvo, and it's sobering when you look at it, in terms of what they're seeing.\r\nRon Gross:On Wednesday,Constellation Brandsreported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations, but a week full-year earnings outlook that focused on the impact of, yes, tariffs was the focus. Emily, how did the quarter look to you? Is it possible for us to remove tariffs from this conversation and focus on the business, or they are so intertwined, just can't do that.\r\nEmily Flippen:I actually think that tariffs are maybe the least interesting thing happening to Constellation Brands business today. I understand why the narrative was around tariffs. It's like you can open up an Internet browser without being slapped across the face with news about tariffs and how they're going to be impacting companies. Certainly, Constellation Brands did say in the quarter that they're expecting a low single-digit increase in their total cost of goods that's associated with the tariffs and sourcing, of course, aluminum cans and other bottling items for the beers and the accessories, I'll say, for the wine and spirits business that they sell. But all of this stuff is happening to Constellation Brands. Meanwhile, Constellation Brands as a business itself, is actually doing a pretty decent job of a turnaround, especially considering the overall beer market. I think it's a disappointment that there's not more discussion around how strong this business has been in an incredibly weak environment for alcohol sales.\r\nIf you compare their performance against other large beer makers,Boston Beer, with Sam Adams being a great example, which has seen declining depletions, declining shipments, declining profitability and sales, Constellation Brands is growing and growing pretty solidly because the beer brands that it is continuing to focus on just have continued to resonate with a consumer that's a little bit more niche, that is a bit more loyal, and that has led to pretty incredible market share gains really consistently for this company in otherwise weak environment. I love that Constellation Brands has performed so well. I'm disappointed that the narrative is, Oh, no, that small single-digit increase associated with the tariffs. But I actually think fast forwarding five years from now, we're probably looking at a better business than today.\r\nRon Gross:They're selling some of their wine brands, Cooks, Miomi, that a good movie? You like that?\r\nEmily Flippen:I do. They're actually almost entirely divesting of their wine and spirits business. And if you look at their performance on earnings per share, non-adjusted basis for the quarter, you'll see the impact of that nearly $3 billion in goodwill write-offs associated with the sale of that business, which has been an underperformer for them for a while. That is obviously a ding on them. Some of the investments this company has made historically just haven't panned out. But they're really focusing on cost energies right now and focusing on what works, which is obviously the Corona, the Medello, the Pacificos. Those have an audience that are way more loyal than not to be offensive to Miomi, which I love their wine is a bit more loyal.\r\nRon Gross:Coming up, we'll talk airlines, building materials, and used cars. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\r\n...\r\nRon Gross:Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ron Gross here with Emily Flippen and Matt Argersinger. On Wednesday,Deltareported that revenue growth stalled a bit in the first quarter and the company did not reaffirm its full year guidance, citing headwinds from the economic uncertainty around global trade. Matt, seems to me it wasn't the quarterly results, but the lack of full year guidance that spooked investors. Shares were up big on Wednesday as Trump paused tariffs, but the stock got smacked on Thursday as investors continued to digest what it all means. As I asked Emily with constellation, I'd love to strip out the economic noise here and talk about the business. Can we do that?\r\nMatt Argersinger:Well, let's try, Ron. It was actually a record quarter for Delta in terms of revenue. Pretty surprising, revenue was up 3.3% year over year, 13 billion, and growth was particularly strong in the premium segment of the business. So first class, business class, revenue there was up 7% year over year. International revenue was also pretty strong, and even corporate revenue was higher year over year, and Delta generated 1.3 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, paid down about 500 million in long term debt. All fairly positive and aligned with what CEO Ed Bastian said near the beginning of the year, which was that 2025 was going to be Delta's best financial year in our history. That is not really working out.\r\nRon Gross:Maybe not so much.\r\nMatt Argersinger:Because even if you go back a month ago, Delta had actually guided for 6-8% revenue growth this quarter. That's a big comedown from that. According to Bastion, things actually started to slow back in February. Well, before these tariff announcements or any hint of them, the company slashed its first quarter forecast. It did maintain its full year outlook back then, though. As you mentioned, Ron, that has now changed. They're not reaffirming that year outlook anymore. The company has pulled its guidance. It's still expecting to be profitable this year, but a far cry from where the company thought things would be coming into the year. I think you have to worry a lot about the state of the consumer here. What travel demand is going to look like, say, over the next 6-9 months, you mentioned the consumer sentiment numbers at the top of the show. One thing that's got to be helping Delta a little bit, though, over the past week is the fall in energy prices that we've seen. It's a big cost input for every airline including Delta. That will undoubtedly help Delta's margins and probably help the company remain profitable for the year if not growing.\r\nRon Gross:On Thursday,CarMaxreported worse than expected fourth quarter results, and while it said it was making progress toward its financial goals, it will remove the timelines associated with them due to the potential impact of broader macro factors. Emily, I know I sound like a broken record here, but the macro environment is hard to escape. Do your best. Tell me how CarMax's business is doing.\r\nEmily Flippen:I actually think the business is doing a lot better than people expect, especially, again, given the narrative right now. I understand that the market is in part selling off CarMax for a few different factors. Of course, one aspect of the tariff implication for CarMax and any other business that is operating in the auto parts industry is that the used car parts that it needs in order to fix and resell vehicles on its platform, those are likely to increase, and that's likely to hurt margins at least in that narrow perspective. There's also an element of, Okay, used car prices are likely to increase with the tariffs as well, and that could hurt demand for used cars.\r\nThat could certainly pride some people out of market, and management was so uncertain of this environment that they did pull that guidance for vehicle sales, which is concerning to investors adding to the uncertainty. You can make the logical argument there for the interim of like, Okay, I understand what's happening here to CarMax. But I actually think that a little bit longer term, taking it one step further, we're likely to see similarly to what we saw during the pandemic that used car prices are likely to go up and that could price some people out of the market. But it's actually a boon for a lot of leaders in this space like CarMax, when the prices of used cars go up, especially in comparison to something like a new vehicle 'cause a new vehicles will also increase making used cars look relatively more attractive for consumers who can make a purchase plus higher cost means higher fees for CarMax. All of that is to say, I actually think they could make up some of the margin here, and the future may not be as negative for CarMax as some investors are pricing in today.\r\nRon Gross:All things considered, does CarMax go on your radar or you still go away?\r\nEmily Flippen:If I had a radar stock this month that I thought was an attractive value that I could make a 22nd, 32nd pitch for it, CarMax would certainly be up there. Digging into it this morning and in preparation for our show here, it reminded me this is an incredibly strong, profitable company, market share leader with a lot of tailwinds if you're willing to hold and overlook some of the near term uncertainty.\r\nRon Gross:Sounds good. On Tuesday,RPM Internationalreported fiscal third quarter results that came in weaker than expected, and the maker of Deglo and Rustleum blamed unfavorable weather conditions and said that sales would be flat in the fourth quarter. Matt, RPM does a lot of business overseas, so it's got the trade situation plus the weather to contend with. How the quarter look to you, and does it tell us anything about industrial activity in general?\r\nMatt Argersinger:Well, lots of headwinds for RPM and lots of headwinds in general for industrial activity, even coming into this quarter and all the tariff news. Really two big challenges for them. They had record results last year in last year's fiscal third quarter, so comparisons are tough. But weather was a big problem in the quarter. If you don't know RPM, they serve primarily in the construction industry, and in much of the country, you had a fairly lengthy winter and then a lot of unusual storm activity in the south and the West, which really affected them. Slow housing market also continues to have an impact. That's been a story for a few years now. Until that picks up, RPM's consumer business is really going to struggle. Sales were down 3% overall. Pre tax operating profits, this is a business with high operating leverage we're down around 30%. With regard to tariffs, though, the good news for RPM is that they tend to be fairly insulated. For the most part, the company manufactures products in the countries or regions where it sells them. They do small amount of cross border activity. It sounds like a situation for RPM, where sales may be slightly down for the year with lower margins, but here is something, Ron, you and Emily can be excited about. RPM is acquiring the pink stuff.\r\nRon Gross:The pink.\r\nMatt Argersinger:Which I'm sure, if you've ever done an industrial cleaning of a bathroom, you've definitely use or at least should use. So the pink stuff joins other cleaning products within RPM's portfolio, including Crud Cutter, Mean Green, and Contobum, if I'm pronouncing that correctly. That guy sounds like the 1927 Yankees when it comes to cleaning portfolio lineup.\r\nRon Gross:I love it. Alright, fools. We'll see you a little bit later in the show. Up next, an interview with Martin de los Santos. He's the CFO of Mercado Libre, E-commerce giant and the largest company in Latin America. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\r\nWelcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ron Gross. Molly Fool senior analyst Asit Sharma caught up with Martin de los Santos, the CFO of Mercado Libre, a few weeks ago at our Market Volatility Summit. In this clip, you'll hear how Mercado Libre became resilient in the long term opportunities for Meli. Motley Fool members can access the full interview and replays from the event at live.fool.com.\r\nAsit Sharma:Martin, I wanted to start. Just looking at this company in general, Mercado Libre has such a history of dealing with formidable challenges from hyperinflation and geopolitical events within Latin America to providing fintech and lending services to populations that often are new to the banking and credit systems. What makes Mercado Libre such a resilient business?\r\nMartin de los Santos:Yes, we were founded back in '99, and we turned 25 years in 2024. With those 25 years, as you can imagine, in Latin America, operating in 19 different countries, we've seen it all. Things going sour very rapidly. Maybe Mezuela as an example, hyperinflation in Argentina, then things coming back as we are seeing it today, Brazil, Mexico. I think we went through a lot during those years. I would highlight a couple of things. First, we operate in commerce and Fintech in a region where there's a lot to be done in those two fronts. Production of commerce continues to be very low compared to other places. We are riding a secular trend of people moving online. The same with Fintech, I think the banks have done a really poor job of including financially, most of the population in Latin America, so that generates an opportunity for us. That's one thing. I will also highlight the culture of the company.\r\nOur CEO, our chairman continues to be Marcos Galbrin, who was the founder of the company. Not only him, a lot of people were with him at the beginning continues to be with the company. We have a very strong culture of entrepreneurship, willingness to take risks. Many times in the history of our company, we have to reinvent ourselves or take big bets, and that's a big part of our success, a culture of excellence, execution, bringing good talent, teamwork internally while competing because we operating in very competitive markets to the outside. I think I would say that we operate in a region that has tremendous opportunities, both commerce and Fintech, and we also have a culture of executing and operating in Latin America that has helped us to be resilient and to be successful in this. Latin America, we came from being a start-up of five people in the garage 25 years ago to last year we became the most valuable company in Latin America, and we have done that I think by culture and execution and the quality of people that we brought into our team.\r\nAsit Sharma:I liked one thing that you mentioned between the culture and the execution, which is the ability to take a risk, to take those big bets. How are things different now that you sit in the chair of a CFO to make sure that the bets have a commensurate payoff for the risk and also maybe in some cases to be the person who's encouraging the company to take those risks?\r\nMartin de los Santos:It's not only my role. I think it's the role of the senior management team. We keep on thinking about the trade off between growth and profitability. In fact, we have a name for that within Meli we call it grow fit because we operating many different verticals have tremendous growth opportunities, but at the same time, they require investments. If you look at the history of the past five, six years, we improve significantly the profitability of our business. While at the same time, we continue to deliver very high growth in both in commerce, Fintech, advertising at the different verticals. However, when we look forward, we don't shy away from investing, even if in the short term, that might put some pressure on margins because the main thing for us is to make sure that we do capture those opportunities that we had ahead of us and not necessarily to maximize short term profits. We do have a long term perspective on the business, but that's a trade off that we do it all the time, deciding where to invest and sacrifice a little bit of margins to capture opportunities in the future, and the whole company and the whole senior management team is thinking in those terms. Then it does risk taking, I think it's the nature of our business.\r\nYou mentioned I used to run the credit business, which we started back in 2017. That's probably the ultimate one that you need to manage and to deal with risk, and we're very cautious in the way we manage that risk. But in other cases in the history of our company, maybe 15 years ago, we took a big bet on adapting our platform to mobile, and that required lot of risk and a mindset of really changing the way we were doing things. If we didn't do that, we wouldn't have a company today. Ten years ago, we started with logistics, which is critical for e-commerce solution. If you think about it ten years ago, we didn't touch one single package. Today, last year, we have 1.8 billion packages delivered through our own fulfillment infrastructure or logistic infrastructure. I think those type of beds that when you need to do when you need to take risk and make sure that you invest behind the long term growth opportunities, that's what differentiates mainly from other companies that might not be willing to take those risks.\r\nAsit Sharma:I wanted to ask you about some overall metrics that you use as you look at the business. I used to work for a company where while we had so many drill down metrics, the owner would come in every day, and he said, I just need one number to run this business. Now, that wasn't true. You need more than one number to run a business. But it taught me something that people like yourself often Kean on a few metrics almost on a daily basis. How do you gauge the health of Mercado Libre from day to day?\r\nMartin de los Santos:Yeah, we are a very data oriented company. Business reviews that are so deep in terms of analysis and data that is true. It's hard to keep up with all the businesses. It's very complex Mercado Libre today. So it's important to have some, big picture views, and then you can drill down whenever you see something that we want to go into more detail. Many different businesses, 19 different countries. You can imagine that the metrics are hundreds. But I would say that obviously, top line metric GMB on our commerce business is very important. Users, last year, I mentioned we have 100 million users, or 100 million buyers on our commerce platform. In terms of engagement, transactions per user is a metric that we follow very closely. That's on the commerce side. On the Fintech side, obviously number of users, 61 million monthly active users last quarter. TPV for the acquiring business, then credit book, asset and the mansion that has been growing more than 100% year and years, is a metric that is very important to see engagement with our platform and then frequency of use.\r\nIn Fintech is very important to have principality. We're seeing people who have engaged with more than one product and how often they engage with different products. That's something that we pay a lot of attention. Then the credit business, obviously, the traditional metrics, MPLs, the spreads of our books, the different books, and so on the repayment of our credit card, for instance, which is a product that you need to invest to build a cohort, I would say those. Obviously, financial metrics at the end of the quarter, at the end of each month are very important to see top line growth, as well as profit margins are the two ones, the two metrics that tells us how we are doing in terms of growth feed rate profitability, as well as growth.\r\nAsit Sharma:Strategically, where you sit, where are you focusing the organization to create the most value when we look out over a very long time horizon? Is there a specific activity or investment that's going to create the greatest yield as we look beyond, say, the medium term that you like to talk about within the management team and encourage employees to think about?\r\nMartin de los Santos:Very important to have an owner's mentality team. We operate. We are fortunate to operate in a platform in a company. That has, as we like to say, has more doors to be open, that has to open them. We have opportunities everywhere we see. In commerce, we're just getting started. Penetration is very low. We continue to grow at a very rapid pace north of 30% year and year, twice the speed of the market, so we're continuing to gain market share. Even after 25 years, we're growing at start-up rates. On Fintech in Mexico, less than half the population have a bank account. Less than 15% have a credit card. The opportunity is immense as well to continue growing. Advertising, we mentioned it before, everywhere you look at mainly there are opportunities. We are fortunate to have a lot of resources to take on those opportunities. 18,000 developers, a very well, very strong balance sheet to invest.\r\nWe generate lots of cash, even though we are investing in our business as well. I think the big challenge is when you don't have a clear constraint is how to make sure that you are investing in the right things. That represents not only choosing what to invest, but also choosing what not to do, not to get and also to make sure that you are investing on things that really have a good payout, and they actually result in growth going forward. That's something that continuously my team and my colleagues at the sea level are continuously looking at, at the end of the day is maintaining this growth feed mentality that we have been operating. We want to make sure that we hit the growth targets. While, not shying away from investing, even if in the short term, we might put some pressure on margins. We don't mind. We don't run the business on a quarter by quarter basis. We run the business for the next 25 years.\r\nRon Gross:Coming up after the break, Emily Flippen and Matt Argersinger return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. Don't buy r sell stocks based solely on what you hear. All personal finance content follows Motley Fool editorial standards and are not approved by advertisers. The Motley Fool only picks products that it would personally recommend to friends like you. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money Ron Gross here with Emily Flippen and Matt Argersinger Fools, we've got time for two quick stories before we hit stocks on our radar. Let's start with the Walmart news on Wednesday,Walmartwithdrew its earnings guidance, citing uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's newly imposed tariffs specifically on China. Emily, the health of Walmart can tell us a lot about the health of the consumer and, frankly, the economy as a whole. What did you take away from these actions by Walmart management?\r\nEmily Flippen:Unfortunately, my takeaway is that things will likely get worse before they get better. The silver lining to this is that Walmart did reaffirm its sales guidance. They actually are perceived to have a little bit more clarity into how consumers are behaving versus what their bottom line may look like, which is obviously heavily impacted by things like tariffs and any negotiations there. Not only does Walmart really act as that bellwether for how consumers are behaving, but it's also really easy to forget that Walmart's a little bit of a bellwether and a leader for other businesses that look to Walmart for guidance. So many companies are likely watching Walmart's decision here to pull back guidance on their bottom line, and they could potentially adopt a very similar wait-and-see approach here as it applies to their own guidance. And that can almost turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy of economic slowing and leading to a market sell-off all because of the cautiousness around things like earnings guidance. Now, I think that could be a dramatic interpretation, of course, and I'll just quickly mention that Walmart does have much more complex supply lines than a lot of other small businesses. Their certainty and clarity there could be more opaque than other companies. But the fact that they are a bellwether for both consumers, which we focus on, as well as other businesses is a bit of a red flag.\r\nRon Gross:The new Superman movie is scheduled to hit theaters this July. As listeners know, I am a Superman fanatic, really looking forward to it. Admittedly, the movies haven't always been so super, but there is a new sneak peek out there. I know you have both seen it, so I'm curious to ask. Do we have a hit on our hands or a dud? Did you have a favorite part of the sneak peek? I'll go to you first Matt.\r\nMatt Argersinger:Well, how can you not love Krypto coming in there, Krypto the super dog, coming in to rescue Superman from whatever ails him in that particular scene. But no, look, I think it looks awesome. I think Gunn did a fantastic job with the Guardians of Galaxy movies. I like that he's bringing a lot of interesting characters into the Superman movie, including looks like Hawk Man's in there. Looks like Guy Gardner, the Green Lantern characters in there. I'm excited. I'm going to go see it with my son, for sure. Emily, a hit or a dud?\r\nEmily Flippen:Well, let's put it this way. You're barking up the wrong tree, because I am not a superhero movie watcher. But I will say this. I watched the trailer at your bequest, and I didn't know the creepy CGI dog had a name. Nice to know.\r\nMatt Argersinger:You don't know Krypto? A creepy CGI dog.\r\nEmily Flippen:There's a lot of CGI in that trailer. CGI has come a long way. I don't know what I'm talking about, as it applies to CGI. I will say, it was obviously CGI, though. I do think it's a little bit of a red flag if you're having to bring in other superheroes to attract excitement. What does that say about Superman?\r\nRon Gross:Well, I am hopeful, and my favorite part is when the Fortress of solitude rises out of the snow as Superman gets closer, almost like it could sense where he was. I love that part. Very cool. Alright, Fools, a quick personal note before we hit stocks on our radar. This will be my last Motley Fool Money radio show. It has been the joy of my career to play a small part in the financial journey of as Chris Hill would say, our dozens of listeners. Thank you for letting me share my thoughts with you for 16 wonderful years. Thank you all very much. I really appreciate it.\r\nMatt Argersinger:Ron, can I just say?\r\nRon Gross:Yes, Matt.\r\nMatt Argersinger:Sixteen years, actually, 17 years with the Motley Fool. You've been a colleague, a mentor, a leader, most of all, a friend. I wish you the very best in retirement, and we will do our very best. It will be a lot harder now, but we will do our very best to keep this show firing on all cylinders.\r\nRon Gross:[laughs] I appreciate that. Thanks, Martin. Very nice. Fools, we have time for a couple of stocks on our radar, so let's close out the show that way, and I will bring in our man Dan Boyd, to ask a question and pick his favorite. Emily, you're up first. What have you got?\r\nEmily Flippen:I'm looking atDexcomthis week. It's nice to have a little bit of positive news in a world that is changing around us so rapidly. Some of the excitement here for Dexcom did get drowned out by tariff talk. But Dexcom did see a little bit of a revival this week because they did get FDA approval for their newest continuous glucose monitor that is a Dexcom G7. It could be worn for up to 15 days so that extending the life versus their previous model, it puts them in more direct competition withAbbott, who is one of their competitors, which also has the FreeStyle Libre, which can be worn up to 15 days. Ahead of Metronic. I definitely move in the right direction here for Dexcom. CGM penetration for diabetics worldwide is still so much lower than what it should be, considering the health benefits that it can bring. I will say, though, I always have in the back of my head, just the fear around a couple of things. One is weight loss drugs, leading to a decline in type 2 diabetes that could eat up some of the market here for Dexcom, as well as actually a potential cure for something like diabetes. That's further down the line, but a lot of research and time is being spent into it, considering it is such a deadly and expensive disease.\r\nRon Gross:Dan, you got a question or a comment?\r\nDan Boyd:Dexcom it's one of these companies that the name doesn't really match up with what they do. The name, to me, is, like, something out of Superman, very sinister. But what they do very good for society. I don't know what to do here, Emily.\r\nEmily Flippen:That's a good point. I will say Abbott sharing its name with Abbott Elementary. Sounds like the friendlier of the options, but I like Dexcom more, despite the name.\r\nRon Gross:Matt, you're up. What have you got?\r\nMatt Argersinger:Ron, I'm looking atRobinHoodMarkets. Ticker H-O-O-D. This is an unusual one for me. I just want to stress, this is a true radar stock, a company I'm just beginning to take a look at. But I heard a great interview with Robin Hood's chief brokerage officer last week. If you look at where young people, I'm talking mainly Emily's age, where they're going to open up brokerage accounts. It's not Fidelity. It's notCharles Schwab. It's certainly notInteractive Brokerswhere I tend to toil. It's Robin Hood. Nearly 26 million funded customers, many, I think most of which are in their 20s and 30s. When that large cohort of investors matures, starts opening retirement accounts, trust accounts, getting mortgages, doing more sophisticated trading. I think Robin Hood is really growing its offerings to like, a whole range of financial services. They also have the Robin Hood Gold membership, which is approaching three million accounts. It offers members higher levels of market data, greater margin access, could be dangerous, and then higher interest on cash and accounts. I have to say, I'm a shareholder in Schwab and I will probably be a shareholder in Schwab for a long time. But if I'm going to make a long term bet on a brokerage company, I might also want to have exposure to a brokerage company that has the most young people coming to it because it's likely to prosper right alongside that growth over time.\r\nRon Gross:Dan, got a question?\r\nDan Boyd:Yeah, when I hear Robin Hood, I associate it with meme stocks likeGameStopandAMCand all that jazz. Is this a company that actually has legs, or is it just something that's going to be a flash in the pan?\r\nMatt Argersinger:Dan, I thought the same thing. It's the meme stock brokerage. But the fact that they have 26 million funded customers, and that has continued growing way past the GameStop and AMC stuff that we saw several years ago, that gives you confidence that has long term staying power.\r\nRon Gross:I, too, am a Charles Schwab shareholder, not a Robin Hood one, but I'll take a look. Could be interesting. Dan, you got a favorite fear watch list?\r\nDan Boyd:Well, it really seems like Dexcom is, like, the smart choice, but Robin Hood, I feel like is the more interesting choice. Can I do both on your last day, Ron?\r\nRon Gross:You can do whatever you want, Dan. Both it is.\r\nDan Boyd:That's awesome.\r\nRon Gross:Emily Flippen and Matt Argersinger, thanks for being here, my friends. That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money.

Most of the aircraft deliveries United is waiting on will come from Boeing, and most of its new Airbus planes are being built in Alabama, though the network of suppliers that the plane makers rely on is spread throughout the world. Rival Delta Air Lines said last week it won’t pay tariffs on any new Airbus planes coming its way and would defer any deliveries affected by new levies."

      "body": "(Bloomberg) -- United Airlines Holdings Inc. reassured investors worried about wobbly demand with a vow to make money even during a recession.\r\nMost Read from Bloomberg\r\nTrump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space\r\nHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?\r\nWhy the Best Bike Lanes Always Get Blamed\r\nDOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on Leave\r\nLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs\r\nThe company plans to control costs and keep its planes full, dialing back flying plans as needed to keep profits coming in should President Donald Trump’s trade war trigger an economic downturn. The carrier took the unusual step of issuing two profit forecasts, saying adjusted earnings will be $11.50 to $13.50 a share this year if the current environment remains stable, or as little as $7 a share if the US economy enters a recession.\r\n“That’s a pretty good downside,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson, who added that he’s never seen a company give a multi-scenario outlook before. “I expect airlines to bleed red in a recession.”\r\n“It is true that the environment has gotten a lot harder,” United Chief Executive Officer Scott Kirby said Wednesday on the company’s earnings call, adding that the carrier has a “real shot” to achieve its rosier outlook. “No matter what the economic environment is, we are going to bust our asses to get there.”\r\nWall Street applauded the two-pronged show of confidence, sending United’s shares up more than 5% during the call before the stock turned negative, in line with a broader market slump. American Airlines Group Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. report first-quarter earnings next week.\r\nUnited offered a counter to warnings from rival airlines that growth and profits are at risk due to Trump’s tariffs. Delta Air Lines Inc. last week withdrew its 2025 financial guidance due to global trade uncertainty and waning confidence among consumers and businesses that has “flat-lined” revenue growth. The parent of Frontier Airlines also withdrew its full-year profit outlook due to the murky economic environment.\r\n“We like United’s guidance approach given the fluidity of the macro backdrop,” Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Linenberg said in a report.\r\nTrump’s rapid trade policy shifts — slapping tariffs on countries and goods before granting relief soon after — have made it difficult for companies to forecast demand and earnings with any precision. United said the macroeconomic environment this year “is impossible to predict” with any confidence.\r\n“Time will tell how the backdrop plays out, but management has had a knack of pulling a rabbit out of the hat,” Melius Research analyst Conor Cunningham said in a note. “At the very least, there is now a downside scenario in which investors can attempt to get comfortable around.”"

      "body": "By Paul Sandle\r\nLONDON (Reuters) -Alphabet's Google is being sued in Britain for potential damages of up to 5 billion pounds ($6.6 billion) in a class action alleging the company abused its dominant market position in the online search industry.\r\nThe class action, filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal on Tuesday, argues that Google's actions enabled it to charge higher prices for the advertisements that appear in search inquiries than it otherwise could in a competitive market.\r\nIt said the U.S. tech giant contracted phone makers to pre-install Google Search and the Chrome browser on Android devices and paid Apple to make it the default search engine on iPhones, with the intention of shutting out competition.\r\nThe claim, filed by competition law expert Or Brook on behalf of thousands of businesses, alleges Google ensured its search engine had better functionality and more features for Google's own advertising offering than that of its competitors.\r\nGoogle said this was \"yet another speculative and opportunistic case\".\r\n\"We will argue against it vigorously,\" a spokesperson said. \"Consumers and advertisers use Google because it is helpful, not because there are no alternatives.\"\r\nBrook said businesses had almost no choice but to use Google ads to advertise their products and services.\r\n\"Regulators around the world have described Google as a\r\nmonopoly and securing a spot on Google's top pages is essential for visibility,\" she said in a statement.\r\n\"Google has been leveraging its dominance in the general search and search advertising market to overcharge advertisers.\"\r\nBritain's antitrust regulator launched an investigation into Google's search services, including their impact on advertising markets, in January.\r\nThe Competition and Markets Authority said at the time that millions of people and businesses relied on Google's services, which accounted for 90% of searches and were used by more than 200,000 UK businesses to advertise.\r\n($1 = 0.7526 pounds)\r\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Paul Sandle in London; Editing by Varun H K, Catarina Demony and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)"

They analyzed deepfake ad scams involving public figure impersonations and developed countermeasures.\r\nThe company introduced technical countermeasures and over 30 ads and publisher policy updates last year. These moves helped suspend over 700,000 offending advertising accounts, leading to a 90% drop in reports of deepfake ads, the company claims.\r\nIn the U.S. alone, Google said it suspended 39.2 million advertiser accounts and took down 1.8 billion ads last year, with key violations tied to ad network abuse, trademark misuse, healthcare claims, personalized ads, and misrepresentation.\r\nIndia, the world’s most populous country and the second biggest internet market after China in terms of users, saw 2.9 million account suspensions last year, Google said, making it the second-highest after the U.S. The company also removed 247.4 million ads in India, with the top five policy violations related to financial services, trademark misuse, ad network abuse, personalized ads, and gambling and games.\r\nOf all the advertiser account suspensions, Google said it suspended 5 million accounts for scam-related violations.\r\nOverall, the company removed almost half a billion ads related to scams.\r\nGoogle also verified more than 8,900 new election advertisers in 2024, which saw half of the world’s population go to the polls, and removed 10.7 million election ads. However, Rodriguez noted that the volume of election ads compared to Google’s overall ad numbers was relatively small and would not significantly impact its safety metrics this year.\r\nIn total, Google said it blocked 5.1 billion ads last year and removed 1.3 billion pages. In comparison, itblockedover 5.5 billion ads and took action against 2.1 billion publisher pages in 2023.\r\nGoogle told TechCrunch that the decreasing numbers indicated improvements in its prevention efforts. By improving early detection and suspension of malicious accounts, fewer harmful ads are produced or reach the platform, the company said.\r\nThe company also restricted 9.1 billion ads last year, it said.\r\nImportantly, large-scale suspensions sometimes spark concerns over how fairly a company applies its rules. Google said it offers an appeal process that includes human reviews to ensure it took “appropriate action.”\r\n“Oftentimes, some of our message wasn’t as clear and transparent about specifics, about what the rationale was, or reasoning, and sometimes that left the advertiser a little more confused. We ended up updating a bunch of our policies as it related to that, a bunch of our transparency capabilities in terms of the messaging around what and why to help the advertiser … It’s been a big focus for the team as part of 2024 and into 2025,” Rodriguez said.\r\nTopics\r\nReporter\r\nMicrosoft researchers say they’ve developed a hyper-efficient AI model that can run on CPUs\r\n\r\n\r\nFigma ignores the fear, files paperwork for an IPO\r\n\r\n\r\nFor security, Android phones will now auto-reboot after three days\r\n\r\n\r\nFigma sent a cease-and-desist letter to Lovable over the term ‘Dev Mode’\r\n\r\n\r\nNotorious image board 4chan hacked and internal data leaked\r\n\r\n\r\nNotion releases an AI-powered email client for Gmail\r\n\r\n\r\nHertz says customers’ personal data and driver’s licenses stolen in data breach\r\n\r\n\r\n© 2025 Yahoo.\r\n1,200+ founders & VCs.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025.\r\nOn April 4, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives appeared on CNBC to discuss the potential impact of current tariffs and compared the situation to an economic armageddon. If the current tariffs remain in place, Ives thinks it would lead to a 15% to 20% demand reduction across the board. He thinks that investor anxiety is much higher considering how things were in the March 2020 COVID-19 crash earlier. The analyst thinks that investors should now focus on the likelihood of tariff adjustments from comments about negotiations, the impact on consumer-focused companies, and the potential for demand destruction. He even thinks that companies may refuse to provide guidance in the first-quarter earnings calls due to the persistent tariff uncertainty.\r\nIves thinks that a lot of tech companies will not be able to absorb high tariff increases and rather this cost will be passed on to the consumers which will lead to significant margin erosion and even potential sales declines. He indicated that tech stocks are currently pricing in a 10% to 15% cut to numbers. He suggests that investors should now look at companies with strong long-term potential as he believes earnings may normalize in 2025 and 2026. The analyst also addressed the defensive performance of defense contractors. While acknowledging the relative stability here, Ives cautioned that even these even such sectors are not immune to tariffs. He noted the significant foreign component, specifically 40% to 50% in some instances, in hardware and other sectors.\r\nOur Methodology\r\nWe sifted through the financial media reports to compile a list of the top NASDAQ stocks to buy for 2025. We then selected the 13 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\r\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here)."

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q1 2025 investor letter:\r\n\"Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG) was the top detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered company’s stock price declined despite having posted fourth-quarter 2024 earnings that were in line with consensus expectations. Search revenue growth remained strong, and management reiterated that the new “AI Overviews” feature is driving higher engagement with comparable monetization. The one miss during the quarter was in the Cloud segment, where revenue grew 30% year-over-year but fell slightly short of consensus expectations. We believe the shortfall was largely due to short-term capacity constraints and that the long-term growth outlook for Google Cloud remains robust. We continue to see Alphabet as a collection of great businesses that can further benefit from the company’s world class AI capabilities. With shares trading at just 15x our estimate of next year’s earnings per share, we believe the stock is meaningfully undervalued.\"\r\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\r\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in 7th position on our list of30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 174 hedge fund portfolios held Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) at the end of the fourth quarter which was 160 in the previous quarter. In 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG)achieveda revenue growth of 14% compared to 2023, reaching $350 billion. For the fourth quarter, the revenue was $96.5 billion, reflecting a 12% increase in both reported and constant currency. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

      "body": "Alphabet's Google (GOOGL) just got hit with alawsuitthat could cost up to 5 billion ($6.6 billion)and it's not coming from regulators this time. A massive UK class action claims Google weaponized its default search engine status to freeze out competitors and force British businesses to overpay for digital ads. Filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal, the lawsuit says Google struck deals with Android phone makers and paid Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to make its search engine the default across devices, locking in market control and pushing ad prices higher than they should've been.\r\nLeading the charge is competition law expert Or Brook, who argues UK businesses had no real choice: if you wanted visibility online, you had to play by Google's rulesand pay up. The claim alleges that Google built a walled garden around search ads, where it not only dominated volume (over 90% of UK searches) but also offered enhanced functionality only through its own channels. Over 200,000 businesses are said to have been impacted. Brook didn't hold back: Google has been leveraging its dominance in the general search and search advertising market to overcharge advertisers.\r\nGoogle's response? Predictable. The company called the lawsuit speculative and opportunistic, and insists people use Google because it's helpfulnot because they're forced to. But the timing couldn't be worse. Britain's Competition and Markets Authority is already investigating Google's grip on digital ads, and the global antitrust spotlight on Big Tech is only getting brighter. If this legal fight gains momentum, it could mark a major turning point in how digital ad ecosystems are governedand priced.\r\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

      "body": "Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and ASML (ASML) are dragging the market lower as investors weigh the impact of the US-China trade war and a potential economic slowdown fueled by US President Trump's policies.\r\nSummit Global Investments chief investment officer David Harden sits down withMadison MillsandBrad Smithto discuss how to play the tech sector, comparing Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL).\r\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Briefhere.\r\nIt's time now for today's strategy session. US stocks opening in the red this morning with tech leading the losses here. Options data showing investors are positioning for further losses in mega cap tech and semis ahead of earnings. That's according to data from Bloomberg. Joining us now with more, David Harden, Summit Global Investments CIO. David, great to speak with you this morning. Certainly a lot of pain for the big tech names this morning.\r\nThank you.\r\nAre you buying big tech at these levels?\r\nWell, I think there's some definitely buying opportunities that are coming available. For example, one of the things that I like is Google. Google has $25 billion in free cash flows last quarter. It's it's it's growing at double digits year-over-year. Its profit margins are great. Its return on equity is around 30%. And the PE is now finally getting down into those reasonable levels you can consider 16, 17, 15. So I think I think these are buying opportunities to start accumulating more positions in something like a Google.\r\nI think what you're highlighting is the, you know, this one thing is not like the other in the tech trade even as you're looking at what is more of a platform play where there's perhaps more of a reason to believe that the consumers would flow into free products that a Google might offer online versus what we're seeing in some of the products and propensity to spend in some of the other tech plays where there might be a consumer pullback in those discretionary dollars. How do you continue to look across these companies once we get into earnings and see how they're forecasting and guiding for the rest of the year on that?\r\nYeah, I think that's really important because where did their earnings come from, right? And and how are they tied to tariffs? That's really important. And how does those tariffs impact like advertising for Google. So you want to look kind of through those earnings into the consumer and and see what that consumer's doing and how that consumer's acting. And I think that's another play in tech. There is a separation. What? Are they hardware? Like Apple's had to navigate a lot more tariff news than Google's had to navigate, even though they're both navigating it.\r\nAnd we're starting to see individual companies being used as tools in this trade war. Obviously with Nvidia's specific chips being impacted by export controls, to what extent does that change any fundamental view you have on these stocks or should investors look past any of that daily headline news on tariffs?\r\nI I I think absolutely, you have to consider that and you have to manage your your risk here. Risk is really, really important in these markets and managing that is essential. So where you have the H20 chip, for example, invidia, they have clearly shown last night on their earnings that they have a difficult time more difficult time than some of these other tech names. So look for tech names that are more US based. Look for tech names that have more um say high-quality earnings. Even though somebody could question Google's high quality earnings, their earnings scores are not very good, but it is more US based. It is more consumer based in the US. And so that's very, very important in tech.\r\nIt seems like we've all been asking the question of what's the next big catalyst to drive conviction within the markets. Does that mean the AI trade or the fast-paced growth cycle for the AI trade is dead?\r\nNo, I don't think so because let's face it. Probably 10 minutes ago you were looking at AI, or I was looking at AI, or somebody was looking at some agent and the and the new things that are coming out with AI agents and things of this nature are absolutely impactful. The power of AI is growing. It's not shrinking. We're using it more. And it will continue to spread. So I think that trade's not done. I think there'll continue to be infrastructure build outs and AI things, but it has to go past just the technology. You have to look into the in industrial side of tech and where are they putting and building these centers at.\r\nI want to get to one of your cells, but first really quickly, would you buy Nvidia at these levels?\r\nUh probably not right now. No. I would be if you're if you're in it, it's time to hold and be patient. But if you're looking to buy, I think there's better opportunities to buy.\r\nAnd I know one of them is Microsoft, correct?\r\nI if you're looking at the two comparison, yes, Microsoft today, Nvidia's down more 6-7%, Microsoft's down in one, one and a half right now. I I think that's a safer play. It's a little bit more if if you will ingrained in our society. The revenues are are more um consistent. And so that's something that I would look at is more something like a Google or Microsoft. Both of those I would consider buying opportunities, especially at these levels.\r\nAnd I know a sell for you is one member of the mag 7. Talk to us about Tesla.\r\nWell, I think Tesla's had some negative earnings. We know that and um it's under pressure. I think every Tesla's uh I I saw a sticker on the back of a Tesla the other day that said something like, I bought this post crazy. So this is this is very, very important right now in our society. But having said that, I think Elon Musk is going to tell you when it's the right time to buy Tesla. And he hasn't done that yet. So he he's outspoken. We know what he's capable of. And until he's ready to let us know it's the right time to buy, I think it's you avoid that stock right now.\r\nOutside of tech, where's your favorite trade, your top idea right now?\r\nAnd I think I think outside of tech, you're going to have to look at some of the healthcare companies that have really been hurt with the Pharmatech news and other things.\r\nIt seems like they're next though in the docket for what potential tariffs may look like.\r\nOh, absolutely. So look for those healthcare companies that are not necessarily tied to pharma and they get their revenue, surgical centers and other places that are hospital-based, that are US-based, that we are going to use on a daily basis, but really are not tied to that. Those are the ones that have been kind of the baby been thrown out with the bath water. Their their valuations are very good right now.\r\nAbsolutely. David, great to see you here in studio. Thanks for taking the time with us this morning.\r\nThank you.\r\nAbsolutely."

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other machine-learning stocks.\r\nGrand View Research reported that the global machine-learning market was valued at $36.73 billion in 2022. It’s now expected to grow at a 34.8% CAGR from 2023 to 2030. Machine learning helps machines and systems learn from experience instead of through explicit programming. It uses algorithms to improve and analyze vast amounts of complex data to make informed decisions. Machine learning is quickly progressing as AI is rapidly expanding and transforming how businesses and individuals operate. These technological advancements are revolutionizing consumer experiences, and enabling convenient creation of digital services, products, and optimized supply chains. With this, startups can focus on specific solutions while larger companies can deliver comprehensive AI platforms.\r\nOn April 10, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the cost of AI and what has to happen to bring it down. Jassy emphasized that the growth in data center demand is now so significant that there is no foreseen attenuation here, even with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties under tariffs. While there’s a general belief that the emergence of DeepSeek could now reduce the need for extensive data centers, processing power, and energy consumption previously forecasted at different tech companies, Jassy thinks that DeepSeek’s introduction did not disrupt any of this. Despite cost reductions that occurred have already over time, AI deployment still requires significant investment. He thinks that the current AI operations are expensive due to chip costs and other factors, but big techs, including his own company, would welcome any reductions in AI costs for customers moving forward.\r\nJassy underscored the demand for data centers despite tariff impacts and reflected optimism regarding lowering costs, which would potentially drive innovation and expanded use of AI across industries. AI is still limited and requires substantial human oversight as of now but it has massive potential across various sectors.\r\nWe sifted through ETFs and financial media reports to compile a list of the top ML stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024.

So after the chip maker disclosed that it would take a $5.5 billion dollar hit from the US government's surprise new controls on its semiconductor exports to China. For more on the latest, let's welcome now Daniel Newman, Futurum CEO. Daniel, it is great to see you here on set. Appreciate it from Texas. Um, you know, before J. Powell, frankly, this was the story of the day. It was chips, it was Nvidia. Nvidia is down here, Dan. It's not about 10%. It's getting clobbered in today's trade. I guess two, two questions to start. One, Dan, were you surprised by that news when you saw those headlines? And two, do you think down 10%, is that move justified in your opinion?\r\nYeah, first of all, nobody should have been surprised by this move. Really the administration's been giving the signal that it was going to clamp down. Now, what was interesting is this week, there was a bit of gyration because they cut this deal, they announced 500 billion dollars of AI supercomputers being built here in the United States. And then a day later, he pulls back on this new export licensing requirement.\r\nThat that, you bring that, Dan. That is an interesting point because there were some folks who thought Jensen Wong was going to be kind of shielded from this. Right?\r\nThey made a deal. I had a few reporters actually hit me up, do you think there was some tip for tat going on. And first of all, I think Trump needs to show, President Trump needs to show that there is no tip for tat. So whether it's, you know, Tim Cook bringing more manufacturing here, whether it's TSMC coming here. But I actually think on the other side of this, and maybe we come back to this, is that I actually think creating some certainty with the, with the community, the business community, about what type of benefit they can expect by onshoring and bringing manufacturing back here. I think that would be a great start. Having said that, national security, economic security, and AI are tightly correlated. Us giving the chips to China, whether it's the tuned down chips or the best chips coming through intermediaries, which they shouldn't be getting. This is something that's giving an advantaging China. There's a lot of people out there that are like, oh, well, this is going to only push their resolve. Do you think China is waiting because we're sending Nvidia chips, they're not investing in Huawei and building their own chips? You can be absolutely certain that they are. This war, this trade war, is largely being fought on the grounds of long-term economic domination. Long-term economic domination will only be had if we control the technology trade. Nvidia is at the forefront of that trade.\r\nAnd what do you think of from an investor standpoint? Here you have Nvidia falling yet again, 8 to 10%. You know, look what happened over the last couple days. It had recovered from its lows, right? And a lot of investors who got in short term experienced that bounce. Where, where do you think that looks like this week?\r\nYeah. I, I look at that line of people around the corner at $150 that just couldn't wait to buy. And you go, what is really changed? Well, first of all, you've got GPUs melting over at, at X and at OpenAI. There's so much demand there. Could Nvidia pivot some of its capacity, not focus so much on building specialized products for China, and make sure we meet all the capacity and demand that's out there for companies that are in the US that are trying to build? You've got $325 billion of CAPEX. And it's been reiterated. So whether it's been Sunder Pichai, whether it's been Satya Nadella, they're all planning to spend. And I genuinely believe, Sylvia, that the companies with, you know, the big operating leverage are going to look at this pullback as the moment to build AI infrastructure out. Because when we come out of this, and we will come out of this, there will be deals made. Calling that on the record right now. It may be a tough couple of months. When deals are made, we will see the economy accelerate. And those companies want to build the future and have that AI infrastructure in place. So the Googles and the Microsofts and the Amazons, they're going to buy Nvidia. Um, and one other thing, if I, if I may, I find it very interesting that everybody thinks that China and their push to build Huawei is going to be so successful. When AMD came out with a competitive product, no one believed they could build the software. Broadcom's making chips for the hyperscalers and everyone said, well, that's great, but they don't have CUDA. So it's not going to work as well. But suddenly, everybody believes that China and Huawei is going to build the CUDA competitive product that's going to undo Nvidia? I believe in China, I believe in their resolve. I don't believe that they have as much competition or much competitive capability today as people are suggesting."

      "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Mark Zuckerberg, the first witness in the Federal Trade Commission’s trial to break up his social media empire, gave a rare window into how he makes business decisions: by fighting for survival, even when his company is ahead.\r\nMost Read from Bloomberg\r\nTrump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space\r\nHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?\r\nWhy the Best Bike Lanes Always Get Blamed\r\nDOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on Leave\r\nLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs\r\nOver a marathon three days of testimony, the Meta Platforms Inc. co-founder and chief executive officer clearly articulated how the social media market has evolved rapidly over time — which, if the judge agrees, could make it more difficult for the FTC to prove Meta dominates it.\r\nZuckerberg was composed, but occasionally evasive, when challenged to explain past emails and other private messages indicating a concerted effort to muscle out competitors.\r\nThose old messages and emails, gathered during the pre-trial discovery process, were more damning than his present-day testimony. The messages, often between Zuckerberg and other top Meta executives, painted a picture of an executive who was paranoid about his rivals and willing to buy competitors whenever possible.\r\nThe FTC is seeking to force Meta to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that the two acquisitions have given Meta an illegal monopoly over parts of the social networking industry. Emails and documents presented at trial show that Meta, then called Facebook Inc., struggled to compete in the mobile app boom in the early 2010s, buying up successful competitors. The FTC said Meta bought the companies to eliminate direct competitive threats.\r\nMultiple Competitors\r\nZuckerberg and Meta’s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Meta faces a wide array of competitors that fight for user attention, including ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, Google’s YouTube, Apple Inc.’s iMessage and Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that TikTok, in particular, posed a “highly urgent” competitive threat when it sprang up in 2018.\r\n“We observed that our growth slowed down dramatically,” as TikTok gained popularity, Zuckerberg said Wednesday. “It was highly urgent, this has been a top priority for the company for several years.” Meta eventually rolled out a direct competitor, called Reels, that now drives a significant amount of video traffic for the company.\r\nZuckerberg was at times vague over his three days in court, and regularly disputed the FTC’s interpretations of his prior emails. As a leader, the way he communicated with staff was often blunt or harsh, and he spent time on the stand trying to add more nuance to what was written by his younger self. He occasionally clashed with the FTC’s lead lawyer, Daniel Matheson, who objected at one point that Zuckerberg wasn’t answering his questions."

      "title": "US Economy to Lose Billions as Foreign Tourists Stay Away",
      "body": "(Bloomberg) —\r\nThe US economy is set to lose billions of dollars in revenue in 2025 from a pullback in foreign tourism and boycotts of American products, adding to a growing list of headwinds keeping recession risk elevated.\r\nArrivals of non-citizens to the US by plane dropped almost 10% in March from a year earlier, according to data published Monday by the International Trade Administration. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates in a worst-case scenario, the hit this year from reduced travel and boycotts could total 0.3% of gross domestic product, which would amount to almost $90 billion.\r\nForeign tourism has been a tailwind for the US in recent years as the cessation of pandemic-era restrictions sparked a resurgence of international travel. But many potential visitors are now rethinking their vacation plans amid increased hostility at the border, rising geopolitical frictions and global economic uncertainty.\r\nOne of them is Curtis Allen, a Canadian videographer who canceled an upcoming US vacation after President Donald Trump imposed punitive tariffs on his home country and suggested it should become the 51st US state. Allen and his partner have been on multiple camping trips to Oregon over the years, but this year, they will be traveling around British Columbia instead.\r\n“We’re not just staying home,” said Allen, 34. “We’re going to go spend the same money somewhere else.”\r\nAllen’s hesitance doesn’t stop there. He canceled his Netflix subscription and is actively avoiding American imports at the grocery store.\r\n“Now it takes us double the time, because we’re looking at where the products came from,” he said.\r\nInternational travelers spent a record $254 billion in the US last year, according to ITA figures. Coming into 2025, the outlook was positive: The ITA projected in early March that the US would welcome 77 million visitors this year, just shy of the 2019 record, before pushing to a new high in 2026.\r\nBut those estimates came out just before stories of harsh detentions at US airports, ensnaring travelers from countries like France and Germany, started making headlines. Major public institutions in Canada, including a pension management firm and a leading hospital, are now advising staff against traveling to the US.\r\nAlmost $20 billion in retail spending from international tourists in the US may be at risk, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis.\r\nEarly signs of a sharp pullback are already showing up. Airfares, hotel rates and car rental costs fell in March, according to a monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics report on consumer prices published April 10. Economists at Goldman Sachs and HSBC Holdings Plc said lower demand, including from foreign travelers, probably played a role."

      "body": "Goldman Sachs Groupreported strong first-quarter financial results, posting a net income rise to USD 4,738 million and announcing an aggressive share buyback program of USD 40,000 million, strengthening shareholder value. The company's stock appreciated by 8%, amid a broader market gain of 6.8%. Recent tensions between the U.S. and China may have injected some volatility, yet the company's robust earnings and share repurchase likely supported its impressive performance. While the Dow Jones saw upward momentum driven by banks and tech stocks, Goldman's financial results potentially amplified its upward trajectory, aligning with broader market trends.\r\nBe aware that Goldman Sachs Group is showing 2 risks in our investment analysis.\r\nRare earth metals are the new gold rush. Find out which 21 stocks are leading the charge.\r\nThe recent initiatives by Goldman Sachs, particularly the sizable US$40 billion share buyback program, aim to reinforce shareholder value, potentially lifting investor sentiment and supporting its ongoing share price momentum. Over the past five years, the company's total return, including share price growth and dividends, was 215.37%, showcasing its ability to produce substantial returns compared to the past year's performance against the US Capital Markets industry. Short-term volatility due to geopolitical tensions seems to have been largely mitigated by Goldman's robust earnings and strategic capital allocation.\r\nIn terms of potential impact, the Capital Solutions Group's formation might capture private credit opportunities, possibly leading to revenue and earnings growth. Revenue is projected to rise 4.9% annually, underpinned by wealth management and operational efficiencies. However, analysts have varied opinions on earnings potential by 2028, which influences the fair value estimation. The current share price of US$462.22 presents a valuable perspective compared to the analyst consensus price target of US$612.0, indicating the share may be trading at a discount relative to expected future earnings.\r\nOur expertly prepared valuation report Goldman Sachs Group implies its share price may be lower than expected.\r\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.We provide commentary based on historical data and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your financial situation.

Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes.\r\n“Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,” he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, “Except this isn’t an eight-part blockbuster, it’s our money.” Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday’s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic.\r\nCramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a “liberation day bottom,” a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, “Not sure, I’m just not sure.” He added:\r\n“Have you ever noticed the weekends don’t provide relaxation anymore because the president’s got advisors? He’s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He’s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime…. Monday’s trading, well, let’s just say that it looks like that it’s earning season so it’s gonna be even harder than usual.”\r\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\r\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Both production and consumption indicated unexpected momentum in March, before massive US levies on Chinese goods kicked in this month.\r\nThe rosy picture will give little comfort to policymakers as economic activities are expected to deteriorate starting from April. Cargo data last week already showed a slowdown in the volume of goods processed by Chinese ports, foreshadowing a decline in commerce as global companies pause orders and reduce output.\r\nThe improvement is “all in the past now,” said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale SA. “Stimulus delivery is still pretty urgent. Things can deteriorate fairly quickly with some high-frequency data showing tariff impact on US-bound shipments.”\r\nIn a sign that tariff fears prevailed, Chinese stocks in Hong Kong extended their losses to as much as 3.3%. The yuan was steady at 7.3297 in the offshore market, while the 10-year government bond yield fell 2 basis points to 1.63%.\r\nThe data released by the National Bureau of Statistics suggests the economy was supported in part by front-loaded shipments before tariffs jumped to prohibitive levels this month.\r\nWithout more stimulus, China could struggle to meet its official growth target of around 5% this year. Exports are expected to contract after contributing to a third of growth in 2024, while business and consumer sentiment will likely suffer a blow from the trade war.\r\nEconomists at international banks including UBS Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. and Societe Generale have lowered their forecasts for China’s 2025 growth in recent weeks to around 4% or lower. Australia & New Zealand Banking Group announced a similar downgrade following the data release.\r\nThe Chinese economy’s performance this year will largely depend on how much stimulus Beijing rolls out and how quickly it deploys support measures. A key factor will be the sustainability of the recovery in consumer demand, which has been buoyed by subsidies for buying cars, appliances and smartphones."

      "body": "Big banks are offering the latest view of how their customers are faring amid President Trump's tariff turmoil, andit's not all bad— at least for now.\r\n\"The message has really been that the sky is not falling,\" Saul Martinez, a bank analyst for HSBC, told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.\r\nFive of the country's largest banks over the past week posted first quarter rises in profits and revenue, driven in part by trading operations that benefited from the market volatility triggered by the initial rollout of Trump's first tariffs in February and March.\r\nRead more:The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\r\nCollectively, net profits at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Goldman Sachs (GS) amounted to $35 billion, a 13% increase from the year-ago quarter. Revenue also rose at all of these banks. Trading revenue alone jumped 17% to more than $36 billion.\r\nMany banks said their consumer customers were still spending, defaults were still manageable, and businesses were not experiencing distress despite the uncertainty about the months ahead. None of the institutions with big Wall Street footprints updated their earnings outlooks for the rest of the year, either.\r\nWhat these results didn't include, however, was the volatile period that followed Trump's April 2 \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement, which took place two days after the quarter ended. Stocks and bonds plunged and have yet to fully recover, ushering in new uncertainty about the economy and the safety of US assets.\r\n\"We're surprised about the degree of ongoing firmwide strength at all 5 big banks ... and the more than expected upbeat views,\" said Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo in a Tuesday note.\r\n\"To us, it all says that events since Apr 2 can still be little more than a speed bump, so long as policy moves faster to help ease most of the uncertainty,\" he added, in reference to promised deregulation of the banking industry expected from the Trump administration.\r\nNot that banks and their top executives were entirely upbeat. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said that the prospect of a recession \"has increased.\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the economy faces \"considerable turbulence,\" with a recession as a \"likely outcome.\"\r\nIn such a scenario, he added, \"earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down.\"\r\nBut many bankers were noticeably more optimistic. The word \"recession\" did not come up once on Citigroup's Tuesday earnings calls with analysts. Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, also offered an optimistic vision of the current turmoil."

      "body": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you cansign upto receive in your inbox every morning along with:\r\nThe chart of the day\r\nWhat we're watching\r\nWhat we're reading\r\nEconomic data releases and earnings\r\nThe American growth trade as we know it — juiced by AI might, hopes of a soft landing, and coming deregulation —may have fallen away. But an outgrowth of shifting tariff policies has sparked another lucrative exchange on Wall Street: the volatility trade.\r\nAsurge in trading activityhas shuttled billions of dollars to the nation’s largest banks as investors have attempted to protect their money or deploy it in the face of market gyrations.\r\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo'sTermsandPrivacy Policy\r\nEarnings reports from the big five banksin recent days revealed they collectively raked in nearly $37 billion in trading revenue this past quarter, touting record sales from equities changing hands.\r\nWarren Buffett famously urged investors to “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” A corollary for the financial institutions facilitating those trades is to sit back in any environment and collect fees.\r\nWall Street wants stocks to go up, sure, but most importantly, it just wants stocks to move.\r\nThe big banks' trading may mostly be for hedge funds, pensions, and large companies — big institutional investors. But everyone's rolling up their sleeves at the volatility and tinkering with their portfolios, looking to optimize or take advantage of the moment.\r\nAs my colleagueJosh Schafer reports, everybody's trading. Dip-buying flows following the week of “Liberation Day” reached record levels, according to data from VandaTrack, including $3 billion in net purchases on April 3. That was the largest daily total since VandaTrack began collecting the data in 2014.\r\nBuying at recent lows and FOMO trading explained much of the heightened activity. But another interpretation is that an entire class of retail investor has been trained to throw their cash into stocks in a continuation of a pandemic-era shift in personal finance.\r\nYou are probably better off not looking at your diminished 401(k) account when the market is convulsing. But pushing an order on a trading app has become something of a pastime for an increasingly large American demographic, the foundation for group chats among young people, and the basis for an entire genre of aspirational lifestyle content.\r\nThat big banks' big shot clients are doing this too is a great \"stars, they're just like us\" moment. But it's also part and parcel of the same volatility that's been a hallmark of the 2025 stock market and a lesson in the importance of a diversified portfolio of banks' business lines."

Some top leaders have expressed to me that the tariffs are putting their businesses into a state of chaos.\r\nBessent added, \"They'll [CEOs] also have clarity on tax and on deregulation. I remember in 2017 I heard a lot of the same things because the tax deal wasn't done until right before Christmas in 2017. And it was the same thing. We can't plan. We can't do this. We need clarity. So, you know, we're going to have clarity on tax. We're going to have clarity on deregulation.\"\r\nRead more:What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\r\nCorporate America has sounded the alarm on the state of the economy amid the tariff turmoil.\r\nJPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said in a recent TV interview that a recession is likely. Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon told analysts on his earnings call on Monday that the prospect of a recession has increased.\r\nBessent's hedge fund mentor Stanley Druckenmiller has weighed in onXthat he doesn't support tariffs above 10%.\r\n\"Well, the consumer is concerned about a number of things ... the pricing and costs of things, inflation,\" Constellation Brands (STZ) CEO Bill Newlands told me on Yahoo Finance'sCatalysts. \"They're concerned about immigration, particularly consumers that have had friends or family who have been involved with issues around immigration. How that's translating is that people are spending less. They're out less in restaurants. They're spending less on consumer goods and consumables.\"\r\nThe Corona and Modelo beer maker has seen beer sales go flat amid the economic uncertainty.\r\nBessent said about the recession concerns from Dimon and Solomon: \"Look, that's their job is to be concerned. But again, I think that there is all this chatter on tariffs and what we're worried about. And, you know, I come from Wall Street, I think Wall Street can continue to do great, but we are focused on Main Street.\"\r\nThe concerns from CEOs have been well placed.\r\nOn April 9, the Trump administration announced a 90-day pause on all reciprocal tariffs, with the exception being China. The tariffs on China, one of the US's most important trading partners, now stand at 145%."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) stands against other key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes.\r\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC’sSquawk on the Street, Jim Cramer reacted to the partial tariff exemptions announced by the White House, interpreting them not as a full retreat, but as a strategic pause designed to avoid punishing American companies. He suggested the administration was being careful not to hand over competitive advantages to Southeast Asian rivals, particularly Samsung:\r\n“So what I saw today, and not to be facetious, but what I see is people saying, you know what, we’ve seen the downside. Maybe we can test it again. But the president has, I don’t want to say blink, because that’s nonsense. What the president did was say, OK, look, we’re not going to continue to punish American companies and give the green light to Korea. I don’t know if you heard Lutnick’s words. He was very specific. Southeast Asia. That’s Samsung. They didn’t want to give the ball to Samsung.”\r\nREAD ALSO:Jim Cramer Hints at a Bigger Agenda Behind Tariffs and Breaks Down These 7 StocksandJim Cramer Reacts to the Surprise Market Surge and Highlights 8 Key Stocks.\r\nTurning to currency dynamics, Cramer pushed back on what he sees as misplaced panic over a weakening U.S. dollar. Instead, he argued that a softer dollar actually benefits American multinationals and gives long-needed relief to CFOs who’ve spent years blaming currency strength for lost market share:\r\n“Well, look, I’m not so certain I’m going to do a little contrary stuff on the dollar here. When we listen to conference calls, for the last four years, all we hear about is it would have been so much better if the dollar weren’t so strong. We keep losing share, the dollar’s too strong. Suddenly the dollar’s weaker, and now we start hearing all the downside, what, the bonds? I mean, I’m almost thinking that, I’m gonna put this out there, the people who are saying that it’s the end of the world, that the dollar is weaker, I think they have to go do some work boots on the ground. […] So suddenly the dollar’s weaker and we are petrified? These are people who have an agenda. And their agenda is to say, you know what matters more than anything else? Our hegemony from a strong dollar. And I don’t get it. If you’re in our business of picking stocks, you’re sick and tired of hearing CFOs say, we are done. We’ve got to stop this dollar rise.”"

      "body": "Madison Millsand Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick examine some of today's trending tickers.\r\nNvidia (NVDA) stock is falling after the company warned that new US chip rules on exports to China would cost the company $5.5 billion. Analysts at Bank of America, Piper Sandler, and Raymond James lowered their price targets for the chipmaker stock.\r\nApple's (AAPL) India suppliers shipped $2 billion worth of iPhones in March ahead of US President Trump's tariffs.\r\nWall Street's top financial firms, like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS), saw record-high trading revenue in the first quarter, driven by tariff-fueled market volatility.\r\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\r\nIt's now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Nvidia, Apple, and Wall Street banks. First up, several Wall Street firms cutting their price targets on Nvidia stock after the chip maker disclosed that it anticipates a $5.5 billion charge from new chip curbs. The US government told Nvidia earlier this month it would need a special license to export certain chips to China. Analysts at BFA Global Research, Piper Sandler, and Raymond James all lowering their price targets on the news. And also, Steve, what I also thought was really interesting here is an analyst over at City talking about how it's not just about Nvidia. This could also impact Broadcom. This could also impact other chip names in the space.\r\nWell, you're seeing them, you're seeing them sell off today. I mean, you know, AMD announced an $800 million charge along in there. Um, you know, Broadcom was trading lower this morning as well. ASML was trading lower, although they released earnings, but, but they're all, they're all part and parcel of this. This is not good news for the chip sector, because, you know, I, I don't mean to just sound like a broken record, but this is uncertainty, and uncertainty, the markets don't love uncertainty.\r\nWell, speaking, speaking of uncertainty, let's get to another name we're looking at. Apple's main suppliers in India shipping roughly $2 billion worth of iPhones in March ahead of President Trump's reciprocal tariffs announcement. That is according to new customs data. Smartphones have since secured a temporary reprieve from tariffs, but persistent tensions between the US and China threaten the iPhone maker's China-focused supply chain in the longer term. The Wall Street Journal reporting Apple is investigating moving some iPhone production to the US, but the process could take years, and CEO Tim Cook has said in the past that it would be difficult to find the skilled labor in America that's needed to build the smartphones. Treasury Secretary Scott Beson dismissed that comment and concern in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\r\nYou don't need a PhD in mechanical engineering to assemble an iPhone. So, I, I'm not sure why Tim Cook says that the skills aren't here.\r\nAnd Steve, I think what analysts who cover Apple might say and investors might say is that that skilled labor does take years to build up, and it's certainly something that allows Apple to turn out these iPhones incredibly quickly.\r\nWell, that's it. I mean, every, you know, labor now is not just, you know, pounding a hammer or nail. There, there's, there's, there's intricacies in the supply chain. You know, I, I know that, you know, the commerce secretary with his comment, you know, we're going to have lots of people screwing tiny little screws into things. That's not what people really want. You know, we want the high-tech value-added manufacturing because, quite frankly, our cost basis is higher. So, if there's value-added stuff to be done, that's great. If it's just, if it's just bringing low-skilled labor, bringing back low-skilled jobs, that's not necessarily, you know, I understand the need for that, particularly maybe in some strategic industries, but overall, I think we want people bringing a skill set to it. You know, I saw a statistic, this was posted on, on, on Twitter by my friend Frank Luntz who I trust. Um, and he got the statistics from the Cato Institute. 80% of the people when asked, said, do you want more manufacturing in the US? 80% said yes. When asked, would you take a factory job? 75% said no. 23% said yes. The other two said I already have a factory job. So, it, it's, you know, it's one of these, it's nice in theory, but in practice, um, you know, you need skilled, the people who are going to take these jobs, by definition, are really going to be skilled labor. Not, not just, you know, people, not just, you know, automatons screwing in screws.\r\nYeah. Right. The price that they're requiring for their labor requires it to be skilled. All right. Finally, trading desks at some of the biggest names in banking crashed in, cashed in, rather, on market volatility in the most recent quarter. And that is not including the past two weeks, which fell outside of that reporting period. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Goldman, all seeing record equity trading revenue during the quarter. Despite the blockbuster results, executives did express some caution about the current macro backdrop. JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon warning of considerable turbulence roiling the US economy. Well, Goldman's David Solomon said the prospects of a recession had increased. You couldn't pay Solomon to mention the word tariffs, but he did semi-maybe allude to it in that comment. Is this trading revenue for banks a signal of strength in your view, Steve? Or is this something that can kind of hide any economic macro concerns?\r\nKind of the latter. You know, I remember I spent the bulk of my career as an option trader, and I used, I loved environments like this. Um, you know, and to Jamie Dimon's comment, you know, about turbulence, you know, I always described VIX as sort of the price of a parachute when the plane hits turbulence at some level. You know, people want that protection. But here's what happens during volatility with, if you're an active trader. You widen your spreads, you shrink your sizes. So, effectively that really impairs liquidity, but if you're the person trading off those bid offs, bid-ask spreads, each trade you do is more profitable. And so, yes, that leads to the trading desks making more money, but really, you know, analysts typically discount that over time. It's actually a little odd this quarter that the analysts are very happy that the banks are making all this money trading because for years, again, as a trader at a publicly traded firm, the analysts were always very dismissive when we had a good quarter.\r\nYeah. Right, right, because it's potentially not a sign of continued gains for, for the banks. Steve, thank you so much for sticking with us. For our audience, you can scan the QR code below to track the best and worst performing stocks with Yahoo Finance.\r\nExactly. My pleasure."

The dollar fell to a fresh six-month low as traders were whiplashed again by a slew of tariff headlines, with Trump launching an investigation into the need for levies on critical minerals.\r\nGold briefly pared gains following a report that China is open to trade talks if the US names a point person to represent the country and shows respect by reining in disparaging remarks, according to a person familiar with the Chinese government’s thinking.\r\nThe precious metal has climbed more than 26% this year and hit a series of record highs as the escalating trade war creates anxiety over a possible global recession and as investors struggle to take long-term positions due to the unpredictability of tariff announcements from Washington.\r\n“I’d love to have a pound for every time someone said it’s a record high in gold in the last few weeks,” Evy Hambro, thematic and sector investing global head at Blackrock Inc., said on Bloomberg Television. “The gold market is kind of thriving in this period of uncertainty, but the foundations are very tangible and real.”\r\nLeading banks remain optimistic about bullion’s prospects over the coming quarters as investors add to holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded funds and central banks continue to accumulate the metal. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is forecasting that prices will rally to $4,000 an ounce by mid-2026.\r\nIn a Bank of America global fund manager survey this week, 42% of respondents expected gold to be the best performing asset class in 2025, up from 23% in March.\r\nNearly half of respondents also thought “long gold” is currently the most crowded trade, knocking “long Magnificent Seven” — which refers to a group of high-performing and influential US companies — off the top position it has held for two years straight.\r\nThe US administration also announced investigations this week into semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports, after placing sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum, automobiles and car parts. It also said it’s negotiating with dozens of other trading partners to lower trade barriers in exchange for relief on higher duties."

      "title": "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Just Recorded A 15% EPS Beat  Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting Nex",
      "body": "As you might know,The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.(NYSE:GS) just kicked off its latest first-quarter results with some very strong numbers. Goldman Sachs Group beat earnings, with revenues hitting US$15b, ahead of expectations, and statutory earnings per share outperforming analyst reckonings by a solid 15%. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.\r\nOur free stock report includes 2 warning signs investors should be aware of before investing in Goldman Sachs Group.Read for free now.\r\nTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Goldman Sachs Group from 16 analysts is for revenues of US$55.2b in 2025. If met, it would imply a modest 4.1% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to increase 2.3% to US$44.52. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$56.4b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$45.10 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.\r\nSee our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group\r\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$592. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Goldman Sachs Group analyst has a price target of US$720 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$490. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.\r\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against theindustryitself. The analysts are definitely expecting Goldman Sachs Group's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 5.5% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 2.7% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 5.2% annually. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Goldman Sachs Group is expected to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry."

      "body": "We recently published a list ofGoldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in.\r\nAs we recentlydiscussedin another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\r\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\r\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’sBerkshirepicks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.\r\nOverall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio.\r\nAn aerial view of an oil rig at sunrise, emphasizing the power of the natural gas transportation industry.\r\nTo compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value."

      "body": "We recently published a list ofGoldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in.\r\nAs we recentlydiscussedin another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\r\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\r\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’sBerkshirepicks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.\r\nOverall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio.\r\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\r\nTo compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value."

      "body": "All right, welcome. I'm Richard Stubbe, Hart Energy’s senior technology editor. I'm here with Neil Modeland, who is the senior business technology development manager forHalliburton. We've been talking about the Haynesville Shale and some of the things that Halliburton brings to it and some ofthe difficulties that the shale brings here. So Neil, do you want to talk a little bit about what Halliburton is doing in the shale and why it's difficult here?\r\nNeil Modeland, senior business technology development manager, Halliburton: Yeah, I think if you look at the Haynesville in general, we've talked about earlier going to longer laterals and more profit intensity than really any other play in North American land. Take a step back and look at what we're doing at Halliburton. We're really trying to minimize some of the costs associated with doing those huge completions in the Haynesville. So what can we do as a frac service provider to pull out some of those costs? One of those things is electrification. So we've got our ZEUS e-fleet [electric fleet] portfolio, and 40% of our fleets in North America are actually running e-fleets.\r\nRS: And you said that's going up.\r\nNM:Yes, and in 2025 we actually expect that to end the year with 50% on that. And really all of our dedicated fleets in the Haynesville currently are e-fleets. That's really helped on driving out some of the costs on a couple of different fronts.\r\nOne [is] just replacing diesel with natural gas, right? You have got a lower cost commodity, and in the Haynesville we have field gas that we can actually burn to create the power generation to power the e-fleets. And that's going to be your total lowest total cost of ownership of any power generation is just burning the field gas. So we have that plentiful in the Haynesville, so that's going to lower the cost. But also the maintenance schedule and just the simplicity of the maintenance is better with our ZEUS fleet. In fact, last month our ZEUS fleets or electric fleets pumped 11% more horsepower hours on average than any of our diesel fleets. That comes because of more simplistic maintenance and just more uptime pumping these jobs and being able to do that better.\r\nRS: More uptime and less maintenance, that sounds like something I would also want for my car or something like that. But Halliburton is also doing a lot of work with automation, right?\r\nNM:Yeah. And really the e-fleets have been a good platform for that. Just the simplicity of control and then the full fleet control through our OCTIV platform has allowed us to step into automation. So last year we commercialized Auto Frac, which is really kind of push-button frac. We upload a typical frac schedule an operator would give us. We then sit down with the operator and talk through ‘what parameters, what target pressure would you like, max rate, target rate, how would you like to ramp up the stage, how would you like to bring down the stage?’ Then once all that's loaded in, it's kind of press button and here you go. So there's your automated frac. If you're riding top pressure, as your pressure breaks down, your rate will increase. That's very common in the Haynesville that we'll see that. We actually commercialized the Auto Frac in the Haynesville last year as well. To put it in perspective, the time savings we're seeing through that automation versus a manual operator, we're seeing about 10 minutes on average. In fact, the Bossier Shale versus the Haynesville Shale is a little more finicky. We actually see a closer to 15 minutes saved per stage pumping time versus a manual operator versus what we're doing with automation."

      "body": "Energy Secretary Chris Wright says Donald Trump’s administration is giving the “green light” to more US oil production, but the signal from the fracking company he used to run is flashing bright red.\r\nLiberty Energy Inc. (LBRT), which Wright led until his appointment to Trump’s cabinet, has tumbled 43% this year, one of the most precipitous declines among US energy stocks. The value of Wright’s stake in Liberty has fallen by nearly half to about $30 million over that period.\r\nLiberty’s rout is a warning that all is not well in America’s shale patch, despite Trump’s pledge to achieve “energy dominance.” Oil field servicers often provide the first indication of an industry downturn because they’re the ones hired to drill and frack new wells. After the trade war and OPEC’s recent decision to hike production knee-capped crude prices, investors expect US shale producers to avoid pumping more barrels into an oversupplied market.\r\nA drop in spending on services means US oil production could stall, or even decline this year, for the first time since the pandemic. So far, servicers are getting the brunt of the impact from tariff fears: An index of the companies has slid 28% this year, compared with 7% for oil and gas producers.\r\n“It’s just going to be painful,” said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at energy-focused financial services firm Pickering Energy Partners. “What comes next, and we’ve already heard whispers of this, it will be slowing down of drilling activity, releasing frack crews.”\r\nLiberty is due to kick off earnings season for oil field servicers on Wednesday after the market closes, with larger rivals Halliburton Co. (HAL), Baker Hughes Co. (BKR) and SLB (SLB) to follow next week.\r\nOil field service companies are largely dependent on producer spending on drilling and fracking new wells for their income, leaving them uniquely vulnerable to downturns. Producers like Diamondback Energy Inc. and Devon Energy Corp., by contrast, can continue to earn revenue from their existing wells. Plus, they have the option of hedging oil prices and renegotiating for lower-cost drilling contracts.\r\nEven before tariffs, servicers had been suffering from lower demand as shale producers become more efficient, which means fewer drilling days and workers to do the same job. Investors will find out soon if further cuts are coming as contracts inked before the trade war expire and producers respond to the slump in crude prices.\r\nWest Texas Intermediate crude oil, the US benchmark, closed at $61.33 on Tuesday, down 14% this year.\r\n“We would not be surprised to see US oil output decline” if low prices persist, Barclays Plc analysts led by Amarpreet Singh wrote in a note to clients on Friday."

This breakthrough sets a new standard for land-based drilling, showcasing the power of advanced digital technologies to improve efficiency and performance in the oil and energy sector.\r\nAt the core of this technological feat lies the powerful integration of Halliburton’s LOGIX automation platform and Nabors' SmartROS rig operating system. Together, these cutting-edge solutions enabled a closed-loop drilling system that dramatically enhanced operational efficiency, consistency and real-time decision-making. Wells delivered ahead of schedule, with higher average rates of penetration and reduced non-productive time, set a benchmark for future digital drilling initiatives.\r\n\r\nThis achievement is not just a technical milestone, it is a statement of leadership. Halliburton and Nabors, a Hamilton-based oil and gas drilling company, have showcased how synergized digital ecosystems can transform complex drilling operations into streamlined, autonomous processes. The integration of advanced real-time analytics, remote control and data-driven orchestration allowed for seamless management of drilling parameters, setting a new standard for precision and performance.\r\nSteve Haden, senior VP of Project Management at Halliburton, highlighted the success of the breakthrough in improving efficiency, consistency and reliability. The wells were completed ahead of schedule, with better drilling rates and less downtime, showcasing the Houston, TX-based oil and gas equipment and services company’s leadership in drilling automation.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this accomplishment even more remarkable is its immediate impact on well construction timelines. The automation of both rotary and slide drilling not only optimized performance but also reduced drilling time, a critical factor in improving the economic viability of oil and gas projects in the region. By minimizing human intervention and maximizing system intelligence, Halliburton and Nabors proved that digital automation is not a vision for the future, rather, it is a powerful solution available today.\r\n\r\nThe strategic importance of this development goes far beyond a single project in Oman. As global energy demands grow, the need for faster, safer and more cost-effective drilling operations becomes paramount. This milestone sets a precedent not only for the Middle East, a hub for oil and gas activity, but also for global markets looking to adopt automated, data-centric drilling solutions. By leveraging the power of digital platforms like LOGIX and SmartROS, Halliburton and Nabors have created a model that other operators can replicate, enhancing global competitiveness and supporting a transition toward more intelligent energy exploration."

Sales and capital spending both came in better than expected, prompting the shares to rise 5.9% at 6:34 p.m. in New York.\r\nCurrent levels of fracking activity suggest US oil output will hold steady, “mitigating the possibility of steep declines experienced by the service industry in past cycles,” the company said. Meanwhile, major shale driller Diamondback Energy Inc. said Wednesday that it’s “actively reviewing its operating plan” for the rest of the year given market volatility, according to a separate statement.\r\n“While the current tumult in commodity prices is not immediately driving changes in North American activity, we expect oil producers are evaluating a range of scenarios in anticipation of oil price pressure,” Diamondback said.\r\nLiberty’s broad footprint across North American shale provides it a unique scope of vision for domestic oil-production trends. The Denver-based oilfield contractor has tumbled roughly 40% this year as US President Donald Trump’s trade war punished crude prices and tarnished the outlook for near-term fossil-fuel demand.\r\nLiberty is the first major US-based oil-service company to post quarterly results, with rival Halliburton Co. set to follow Tuesday morning.\r\n(Updates with sales, capital spending in second paragraph; Diamondback comment in third paragraph.)\r\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\r\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\r\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\r\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\r\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\r\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\r\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P."

      "body": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported a beat on first quarter earnings Tuesday, even as concerns linger about how President Trump's tariffs will impact its medical device business, as well as how a probe into pharmaceutical tariffs will impact its business.\r\nJ&J reported first quarter revenue of $21.9 billion, beating Wall Street estimates by 1.4%. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.69, beating Wall Street by 6.7%. Despite the beat, J&J's stock traded down less than 1% Tuesday.\r\nThe company raised its 2025 sales guidance Tuesday by $700 million, putting the new target at 3.3% to 4.3% growth, or a midpoint of $92 billion. That is despite a decline in sales after the patent expiry of Stelara, the company's blockbuster inflammatory condition treatment, this year.\r\nOn an earnings call Tuesday, executives said that China, Canada, and Mexico are where the company has the most exposure on tariffs.\r\nCFO Joe Wolk estimated about $400 million in tariff impact, saying it would primarily hit the medical devices business.\r\n\"It would include, to some small degree, some of the steel and aluminum tariffs that impact some of our products. It includes the China tariffs, as well as the China retaliatory tariffs — and that is probably the most substantial out of all the tariffs,\" Wolk said.\r\nHe told Yahoo Finance that up to 70% of the tariff impact is from the products exported to China from the U.S.\r\nThe hit from tariffs is being taken on as cost of goods and will \"sit on the balance sheet ... in future periods,\" Wolk said.\r\nAsad Haider, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research head of the healthcare business unit, told Yahoo Finance that the company reduced its research costs and also has a lot more leverage, due to its size, to whether the current tariff confusion.\r\n\"We don't really know line items...it speaks a little bit to the leverage they have across the P&L to make these types of investments,\" Haider said.\r\nThe industry is also bracing for the impact of the investigation into pharmaceutical tariffs, which the Trump administration announced Monday.\r\nHowever, CEO Joaquin Duato said, \"It is also important that companies in healthcare partner with the administration to look to mitigate some of the vulnerabilities that exist today in our healthcare supply chain so as to avoid any continuity of supply effect.\"\r\nJ&J has also faced some of the same industry pressures as its peers in recent years, including the Inflation Reduction Act's Medicare price negotiations. But it is also pressured by the ongoing talc litigation andrecently faced a major setback in the courts, with a judge rejecting a potential $10 billion settlement."

      "body": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported stronger-than-expected earnings. Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research head of the healthcare business unit Asad Haider joins Catalysts withMadison Millsand StoneX senior adviser Jon Hilsenrath to take a closer look at the earnings print and Johnson & Johnson's position as US President Trump pushes for tariffs on pharmaceutical imports.\r\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\r\nJohnson & Johnson topped the street's expectations in its latest quarter, thanks to strong cancer drug sales during the 3-month period. The company boosted its full-year sales outlook, but tempered expectations for its adjusted operational profit, citing the impact of a recent acquisition and, of course, tariffs. President Trump has warned that levies will be placed on the sector very soon. Joining us now to discuss is Saad Hater, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research Head of the Healthcare Business Unit. Saad, great to speak with you. Let's start on Johnson & Johnson maintaining the EPS outlook. How were they able to do that in your view and what are your other big takeaways?\r\nYeah, thanks for having me. Um so, there there were some questions. I mean, overall, we thought that the quarter was actually very encouraging and very much in line with the thesis uh that we have on Johnson & Johnson. And just to zoom out for a second, we upgraded the stock to buy last week, uh based on our view that the innovative medicine business is going to continue to surprise on the upside and show encouraging trends. And that's really what you saw. Now, there was some gross margin related pressure, um which they cited, uh they attributed to Part D dynamics. This is the first quarter that the pharma industry is going to see uh some headwinds from the inflation reduction act, uh particularly related to Part D. Uh and there were also some tariff related costs that they that they talked about, um about $400 million that they attributed to the MedTech business. But beneath the hood, uh the pharma business did really well and their operating margins actually beat because they flex the P&L by cutting costs and cutting R&D. And to us, that was actually a very encouraging sign. And I think the combination of those things, along with a little bit of an FX tailwind, had them maintain uh the earnings for the year.\r\nAnd how are you thinking about the impact of tariffs, both on on Johnson & Johnson, and then just moving forward? Because they are the first pharma name to report, what does the what what did their results tell you about how the rest of the industry might be impacted by tariffs as well?\r\nWell, the short answer is not much. And I think uh it's still all very uncertain. I think uh we all have been waiting to see what the announcement for tariffs is. I think what's known, of course, is that uh the the pharmaceutical industry is going to have be tariffed, the way semiconductors and autos and several other industries are. Uh we've been waiting for this for a while. What we also know is that there has already been a section 232 investigation that has begun. Uh and uh depending on how that goes, uh what we're all going to be waiting for is to see what level of tariffs are going to be applied to the industry. And uh at this point, I just don't think we have a lot of clarity on any of that. And so, what that's been doing is creating a lot of uncertainty across the entire pharmaceutical sector. It's making people question the traditional orthodoxy around the margin structure and the profitability of this sector. But we just don't know a lot right now, and I think it would be too early for me to speculate on where this all lands. Uh but this is a cloud that the sector that it's an overhang on the sector. And until we get a real off-ramp, uh it's going to be hard to see how that uh um you know, how that overhang goes away.\r\nAnd Saad, my guest host, John Hilsenrath, is still with me. John, you got a question for Saad?\r\nSaad, you you talk about J&J flexing their earnings muscle by cutting costs and cutting R&D. Uh I'm listening to hear how all of this affects the economy, and that sounds like bad news to me.\r\nWell, I don't think it's I don't think it's bad news necessarily. I mean, I think we don't we don't really know uh line items on what exactly they did on the SG&A and the R&D side. I think it just speaks a little bit to the leverage that they have across the P&L to uh you know, make these types of investments. I think what's more interesting is just the way that Johnson & Johnson is has been responding, as I expect others to to to these tariff threats, which is uh building uh infrastructure, manufacturing facilities in the US. I think everyone saw that uh about 3 weeks ago, they announced a $55 billion manufacturing commitment to the US that is higher, that's about 25% higher than what they had initially said they'd do. Uh they opened a new facility in North Carolina, which they are going to use to manufacture in the US. And there's three other facilities that they're going to bring on the manufacturing side that are yet to come. So, I think those types of measures are probably more important for, as far as the overall economy goes, than them, these pharma companies, really flexing the the the the P&L in there with with things like SG&A and and R&D.\r\nYeah, Saad, I'm also curious how you're thinking about the impact of China and any China demand on this. John, I wonder if you have a question to that end as well.\r\nWell, I I mean, I'm I'm interested in in China, and I'm also interested in, you know, the risk that that they cut off supply chains and that that affects the supply chain of the pharma industry.\r\nI mean, John, I just don't think we know. I just think it's just too early to speculate how this all plays out. Um like I said, uh there are we are right now navigating navigating a period in the pharmaceutical sector where there are just a lot more questions than there are answers. I think it would be too premature for me to speculate uh on, you know, where uh what gets tariffed, what happens with China, what happens with demand. Um but our focus is just on fundamentals, and our call on J&J really has to do with the fact that their pharma business and some of the new product cycles within their pharma business are actually underappreciated, based on some of the diligence that we've done. And once this blows through, I mean, that's really where we'd be guiding investors."

      "body": "Johnson & Johnsonrecently announced a 4.8% increase in its quarterly dividend and released positive Phase 3 clinical data for icotrokinra, an oral treatment for plaque psoriasis. These events occurred alongside solid earnings reports, with a significant rise in net income and earnings per share compared to the previous year. While the company's stock price increased by 6.64% over the last quarter, the broader market also trended upward, climbing 5.9% in the past year. These company developments likely complemented the overall market movements and investor sentiment, rather than diverging from broader trends.\r\nYou should learn about the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Johnson & Johnson.\r\nOutshine the giants: these 25 early-stage AI stocks could fund your retirement.\r\nJohnson & Johnson's recent dividend increase and positive Phase 3 clinical data for icotrokinra could significantly bolster investor confidence by enhancing perceptions of future earnings potential and revenue growth. The company's total return, including dividends, was 17.11% over the past five years, indicating steady but moderate financial performance. This is set against the backdrop of a one-year underperformance relative to the US Pharmaceuticals industry's 7% decline.\r\nLooking forward, these announcements could positively influence earnings forecasts, especially with expected boosts from TREMFYA and RYBREVANT within the Innovative Medicine segment. This aligns with strategic acquisitions and product launches that have been projected to grow revenue and expand market footprint. Despite these gains, competition and economic pressures remain considerations, particularly in international markets like China.\r\nCurrently trading at US$150, the share price reflects a modest discount to the analyst consensus price target of US$171.11. This implies potential upside and suggests market expectations are still reconciling with Johnson & Johnson's future growth prospects. Revenue and earnings forecasts will likely incorporate these developments, while still being mindful of existing risks such as biosimilar competition and macroeconomic pressures.\r\nReview our historical performance report to gain insights into Johnson & Johnson's track record.\r\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.We provide commentary based on historical data and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your financial situation.

      "body": "J&J is projecting a $400m hit due to US tariffs in 2025, but reaffirmed its profit outlook while raising its sales forecast.\r\nJohnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine (J&J) addressed the potential impact of pharmaceutical tariffs during its Q1 2025 earnings call, as the US government intensifies its scrutiny of foreign drug supply chains. The company’s chief financial officer Joseph Wolk said the company expects a $400m cost tied to newly proposed and existing tariffs, with the largest burden stemming from China’s retaliatory duties on US-origin goods.\r\nWith the possibility of pharma-specific tariffs looming and the Department of Commerce announcing the launch of a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceutical imports on 14 April, investors were watching closely for commentary from J&J on US trade policy. The investigation gives President Donald Trump 90 days to determine whether tariffs should be imposed on national security grounds.\r\nThe gold standard of business intelligence.\r\nFind out more\r\nCEO Joaquin Duato said the company is analysing the Section 232 process, noting it had been anticipated and would be treated as a normal regulatory development. “It’s important that companies in healthcare partner with the administration to look to mitigate some of the vulnerabilities that exist today in our healthcare supply chain,” Duato said.\r\nA new survey from GlobalData aims to gain insights into deploying new technology in clinical research.\r\n“We plan to do it in this process to make sure that we have enough manufacturing capacity here in the US to be able to address multiple scenarios. We want to be deferential to the administration and their process,” he added.\r\nMany large pharma companies like MSD and Novartis have announced plans to increase manufacturing activity in the US against the backdrop of these tariff announcements, and J&Jannounced its own $55m US investmentin March 2025.\r\n“Since President Trump’s 2017 tax reform, the investment in manufacturing – both in medtech and in pharmaceuticals – has significantly increased. When you think about our recent announcement of investing $55bn over the next four years at the completion of this investment plan, essentially all our advanced medicines that are used in the US will be manufactured in the US,” said Duato.\r\nJ&J indicated that most of the projected $400m tariff impact will affect itsMedtech division. The total includes duties from China, as well as import tariffs from Mexico and Canada not excluded under the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). Wolk noted that mitigation strategies are limited due to existing price controls and contractual agreements, particularly in the pharmaceutical segment. Tariff-related costs will primarily be recorded as inventory before impacting future profit and loss statements.\r\nDespite the headwinds, J&J posted Q1 results above analyst expectations. Revenue for the quarter rose by 2.4% to $21.9bn, with operational growth of 4.2% and adjusted operational growth of 3.3%. Oncology products, including multiple myeloma drug Darzalex (daratumumab), remained key contributors.\r\nThe company raised its 2025 sales forecast by $700m to $92bn at the midpoint, reflecting the addition of Caplyta (lumateperone) following its$14.6bn acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies. However, J&J lowered its adjusted operational EPS growth projection to 6.2%, down from 8.7%, citing dilution from the acquisition. Adjusted reported EPS growth remains unchanged at 6.2%, consistent with guidance first issued in January 2025.\r\nJ&J also reported regulatory approvals for two key therapies in 1Q: the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)cleared Tremfya (guselkumab)for Crohn’s disease, and theEuropean Commission (EC) approvedRybrevant (amivantamab-vmjw) for specific lung cancer indications.\r\nMedtech operational sales rose 4.1%, with growth driven by cardiovascular and general surgery segments. Orthopaedics showed weakness, particularly in spine and sports medicine.\r\nLegal challenges remain ongoing. In April 2025, a Texas court blocked J&J’s attempt to resolve talc-related liabilities via a bankruptcy filing by its subsidiary Red River Talc. J&J previouslyexpressed its intention to defend itselfagainst the claims, which it insists are “meritless” and “premised on junk science”. J&J intends to recover up to $7bn from legal reserves.\r\n\r\nThe gold standard of business intelligence.\r\nFind out more\r\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\r\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\r\n\r\nPharma Technology Focus : Pharmaceutical Technology Focus (monthly)\r\nThematic Take (monthly)\r\nVisit ourPrivacy Policyfor more information about our services, how we may use, process and share your personal data, including information on your rights in respect of your personal data and how you can unsubscribe from future marketing communications.

      "body": "We recently published a list ofJim Cramer’s Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\r\nOn Friday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer outlined what investors should focus on in the week, especially pointing to earnings reports from major banks.\r\n“Rumor, innuendo, intrigue these are the stuff of great novels, of fabulous miniseries, riveting plays, and now they’re the stuff of the stock market.”\r\nREAD ALSO:Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocksand10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently.\r\nHe noted the chaotic nature of the current environment and remarked that “this tape has it all,” and emphasized how unpredictable developments from the White House have added to the turbulence. Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes.\r\n“Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,” he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, “Except this isn’t an eight-part blockbuster, it’s our money.” Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday’s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic.\r\nCramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a “liberation day bottom,” a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, “Not sure, I’m just not sure.” He added:\r\n“Have you ever noticed the weekends don’t provide relaxation anymore because the president’s got advisors? He’s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He’s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime…. Monday’s trading, well, let’s just say that it looks like that it’s earning season so it’s gonna be even harder than usual.”\r\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\r\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here)."

Wolk said the estimated costs represent a \"worst-case scenario\" and take into account President Trump’s 90-day pause, China's retaliatory tariffs and the resumption of the U.S. tariffs. J&J isn't doing anything differently yet in response to tariffs, Wolk added."

      "body": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)beat first quarter earningsexpectations, but concerns over a $400 million tariff impact, mainly from China, are keeping shares flat. Yahoo Finance Senior ReporterAnjalee Khemlanijoins Market Domination to show how the company's medical device business is feeling the pressure.\r\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere.\r\nJohnson & Johnson tops first quarter earnings estimates, but the pharma company expecting a tariff impact on business. And Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani joins us now with the very latest, Anj.\r\nThat's right, Josh. And we know that of course, tariffs are top of mind for the entire pharma sector as, we know, we heard the announcement from the administration yesterday about the specific pharmaceutical tariffs. Uh, Johnson & Johnson sort of bridges two gaps. It's it also sells medical devices and that includes to China. So that is where a lot of the impact comes from for the business. Just taking a quick look at the earnings, they did beat on both the revenue as well as earnings per share, but that doesn't seem to really have helped their stock. It's been trading largely flat, but, you know, slightly negative all day long. And that's because Wall Street is still waiting to hear about the final impacts. We took a look at what they said during the earnings call and they said they were expecting about $400 million in terms of impact and that's largely coming from those medical devices. I had a chance to catch up with CFO Joe Wolk earlier today and here's what he had to say specifically about where that $400 million is coming from. Take a listen.\r\nThe tariffs that we've included in that 400 million relate to products that are not exempt under USMCA, some of the aluminum and steel tariffs that currently exist and apply to our MedTech products, and then the China tariffs, both, uh, uh, from China as well as the retaliatory, uh, tariffs that China had levied upon us. That last piece makes up probably about 70% of the total $400 million. So those are products of origin here in the US being shipped to China, and that's the impact that we we actually have. So we'll have to see with respect to pharmaceutical tariffs.\r\nSo they're still waiting like the rest of the industry for the rest of the, you know, the other shoe to drop, essentially. And that's where things stand right now for, uh, for the medical devices. Uh, we've seen analyst notes all day talking about how they have less protection, uh, from China in particular, but also the Mexico, Canada, as you as they mentioned, or as he mentioned earlier, about the steel and aluminum there. Uh, looking at what's ahead and how to sort of, you know, wait for everything else to fall out for the year, I asked him how he's thinking about this, in particular how to, you know, run the company knowing that the the situation is still kind of fluid. And here's what Joe had to say.\r\nMy only role, I guess, as CFO at this point would be to look at the profitability of business. If these tariffs continue to escalate, then you just have to make decisions like we would in any other part of our business. And we're currently doing within our orthopedics and surgery portfolio, rationalizing skews that are on the less profitable and perhaps even unprofitable side, in either certain markets or certain product portfolios. And that would be no different.\r\nSo, as you can see, just looking at, uh, you know, rationalizing the business, and this is already impacting the company, the first of the major pharmaceuticals to report in this quarter. So we'll just have to wait and see how the rest stack up by comparison.\r\nAll right, thank you, Anj. Appreciate it."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes.\r\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC’sSquawk on the Street, Jim Cramer reacted to the partial tariff exemptions announced by the White House, interpreting them not as a full retreat, but as a strategic pause designed to avoid punishing American companies. He suggested the administration was being careful not to hand over competitive advantages to Southeast Asian rivals, particularly Samsung:\r\n“So what I saw today, and not to be facetious, but what I see is people saying, you know what, we’ve seen the downside. Maybe we can test it again. But the president has, I don’t want to say blink, because that’s nonsense. What the president did was say, OK, look, we’re not going to continue to punish American companies and give the green light to Korea. I don’t know if you heard Lutnick’s words. He was very specific. Southeast Asia. That’s Samsung. They didn’t want to give the ball to Samsung.”\r\nREAD ALSO:Jim Cramer Hints at a Bigger Agenda Behind Tariffs and Breaks Down These 7 StocksandJim Cramer Reacts to the Surprise Market Surge and Highlights 8 Key Stocks.\r\nTurning to currency dynamics, Cramer pushed back on what he sees as misplaced panic over a weakening U.S. dollar. Instead, he argued that a softer dollar actually benefits American multinationals and gives long-needed relief to CFOs who’ve spent years blaming currency strength for lost market share:\r\n“Well, look, I’m not so certain I’m going to do a little contrary stuff on the dollar here. When we listen to conference calls, for the last four years, all we hear about is it would have been so much better if the dollar weren’t so strong. We keep losing share, the dollar’s too strong. Suddenly the dollar’s weaker, and now we start hearing all the downside, what, the bonds? I mean, I’m almost thinking that, I’m gonna put this out there, the people who are saying that it’s the end of the world, that the dollar is weaker, I think they have to go do some work boots on the ground. […] So suddenly the dollar’s weaker and we are petrified? These are people who have an agenda. And their agenda is to say, you know what matters more than anything else? Our hegemony from a strong dollar. And I don’t get it. If you’re in our business of picking stocks, you’re sick and tired of hearing CFOs say, we are done. We’ve got to stop this dollar rise.”"

      "body": "Johnson & Johnson JNJ reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter 2025 results. The world's biggest healthcare products maker continued with its long streak of earnings beat and also exceeded revenue estimates. It raised its revenue guidance for this year amid tariff chaos and boosted its quarterly dividends.Given the resilience of the drugmaker amid the potential tariff shifts under the Trump administration, investors should tap the company’s growth prospects through ETFs with the largest allocation to this diversified drug maker. These includeiShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETFIHE,iShares U.S. Healthcare ETFIYH,First Trust Nasdaq Pharmaceuticals ETFFTXH,Health Care Select Sector SPDR FundXLV andVanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETFPPH.JNJ’s first-quarter earnings per share came in at $2.77, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 and improved 2.2% from the year-ago earnings.

Sales of JNJ’s top-selling blood cancer treatment, Darzalex, jumped 20% to $3.2 billion, while Xarelto generated $690 million in sales, up 33% year over year.

The new guidance reflects the addition of Caplyta (lumateperone) following its $14.6 billion acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies. The company maintained its adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of $10.50-$10.70 due to tariff costs, dilution from the Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition, and updated foreign exchange. JNJ revealed tariff costs of roughly $400 million this year.The drugmaker lifted its quarterly dividend to $1.30 per share from $1.24 per share, marking the 63rd year of consecutive increases.

      "body": "We recently published a list of the10 Best Dividend Monarchs to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other best dividend monarchs.\r\nDividend-focused investors are generally well-acquainted with terms like Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Kings, but many may not be aware of a lesser-known group called Dividend Monarchs. While they fall under the broader category of dividend growth stocks, they carry a distinct title. The Dividend Monarchs Index highlights US companies that have managed to raise their dividends consistently for at least 50 consecutive years. These firms have weathered decades of market ups and downs, showcasing both resilience and steady performance in terms of dividend growth and stock returns. As an evolution of the well-known S&P Dividend Aristocrats Index Series, the S&P Dividend Monarchs Index sets an even higher standard, recognizing a more exclusive tier of long-term dividend payers.\r\nS&P Dow Jones Indices has been a pioneer in dividend growth strategies since the 1980s, initially tracking US companies with at least 10 years of dividend increases. As the number of such companies grew, the threshold was raised to 25 years, forming the basis for the Dividend Aristocrats Index, launched in 2005. This index became a widely recognized benchmark, eventually expanding to include mid- and small-cap stocks as well as global markets. By April 2023, over $40 billion in ETF assets tracked these indices. With a rising number of companies now surpassing 50 consecutive years of dividend growth across different market caps, S&P introduced the Dividend Monarchs Index in 2023 to reflect this new elite group.\r\nThe key distinction between Dividend Kings and Dividend Monarchs lies in the inclusion criteria. While both require at least 50 consecutive years of dividend increases, Dividend Monarchs must also meet specific standards set by S&P. To qualify for the Dividend Monarchs Index, a company must be part of the Composite 1500, have a float-adjusted market capitalization of at least $2 billion, maintain a three-month average daily trading value of $5 million or more, and consistently grow its dividend over five decades. This added layer of eligibility makes Monarchs a more selective, index-based group.\r\nCompanies that meet the tough 50-year dividend growth requirement tend to show strong profitability and financial stability. According to an S&P Dow Jones Indices report dated April 30, 2023, the Dividend Monarchs Index outperformed both the broader market and the S&P Composite in terms of return on equity (ROE) and showed more consistent earnings. The report also noted that, based on back-tested data since January 31, 2018, the Dividend Monarchs Index displayed more defensive traits—offering lower volatility and smaller drawdowns than the S&P 500 during market declines."

Electrophysiology was the only cardiovascular group to decline in the quarter, as sales for the segment overall grew by more than 16% to $2.1 billion.\r\nThe decline, which J&J attributed to competition, contrasts with rivals’ early reports: Medtronic touted strong adoption of its PFA device early in its launch, and Boston Scientific’selectrophysiology sales skyrocketedby 138% last year to nearly $2 billion, posting triple-digit growthas early as the second quarter.\r\nPFA systems use non-thermal energy to affect heart tissue that causes atrial fibrillation, or an irregular heartbeat. Devices have only been on the market for a short time, but they are already eating up cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation procedures.\r\nTruist Securities analysts, in a Tuesday note, wrote that J&J missed Wall Street’s sales estimates for electrophysiology by about $50 million, with a miss of about $9 million in the U.S. They added that J&J’s struggles are likely to benefit Boston Scientific and Medtronic given their “sustained head starts in PFA.”\r\nJ&Jreceived FDA approval for its VaripulsePFA device in November, trailing Boston Scientific and Medtronic to the market by almost one year. The companypaused U.S. cases of Varipulse in January for roughly five weeksand worked with the FDA due to safety concerns. At the time of the pause, Wall Street analysts cautioned that it could discourage physicians from using the device, because rival systems had not been connected to patient safety issues.\r\nIn February, RBC Capital Markets analystssaid that physicians’ enthusiasm for Varipulse may have been affectedby the company’s decision to stop U.S. cases, writing that J&J would have “to take meaningful steps to educate healthcare professionals.” They wrote that the company should still “be able to drive Varipulse adoption.”\r\nJ.P. Morgan analysts, in a note after Tuesday’s earnings call, echoed the concerns RBC discussed a few months ago.\r\nKeep up with the story. Subscribe to the MedTech Dive free daily newsletter\r\n“While [U.S.] Varipulse cases resumed in the quarter, we continue to expect the [O.U.S. and U.S.] challenges that Varipulse has had to potentially have a lasting negative impact on physician perception of the safety of the catheter,” the analysts wrote, “especially in light of the several safe alternatives now on the market.”\r\nDespite the early success of Medtronic and Boston Scientific, the J.P. Morgan analysts wrote that J&J’s electrophysiology weakness in the quarter was expected.\r\nOverall, medtech brought in sales of $8.02 billion, representing a 2.5% increase year over year.\r\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\r\nFrom the start, the DNA sequencing leader faced pressure to unwind its $8 billion acquisition of the cancer screening developer.

      "body": "JPMorgan Chase & Co.(JPM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\r\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +0.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which JPMorgan Chase & Co. falls in, has lost 4.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\r\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\r\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\r\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\r\nFor the current quarter, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is expected to post earnings of $4.44 per share, indicating a change of +0.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.3% over the last 30 days.\r\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.06 points to a change of -8.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.\r\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.31 indicates a change of +6.9% from what JPMorgan Chase & Co. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.\r\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)."

      "body": "We recently published a list ofGoldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in.\r\nAs we recentlydiscussedin another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\r\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\r\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’sBerkshirepicks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.\r\nOverall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio. So, let’s take a look at the top Goldman Sachs value stocks.\r\nA group of business people discussing plans around a boardroom table adorned with a financial services company logo.\r\nTo compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value."

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\r\nKey Points\r\nDespite recent stock market volatility,JPMorgan Chase(JPM-1.47%)shares are down just 1% year to date, outperforming the 9% decline in theS&P 500(^GSPC-2.24%)at the time of writing. The banking giant continues to benefit from its fortress-like balance sheet and global diversification, making it well-positioned to navigate any economic environment.\r\nThat was the message from CEO Jamie Dimon presenting the bank's first-quarter earnings report (for the period ended March 31). JPMorgan topped Wall Street estimates, with revenue climbing 8% year over year, while earnings per share (EPS) of $5.07 was up 14% from the prior-year quarter.\r\nYet the results arrived with a tone of caution. Jamie Dimon also said the U.S. economy faces \"considerable turbulence\" amid the looming impact of tradetariffsbeing implemented by the Trump administration.\r\nLet's discuss what tariffs and a trade war might mean for JPMorgan and its stock price outlook now.\r\nJPMorgan started the fiscal 2025 year off strongly, with all three of its business segments delivering revenue growth.\r\nThe flagship Commercial & Investment Bank group saw excellent momentum, driven by optimism about the economic outlook at the beginning of the year and record market levels that propelled trading activity and deal-making. In the Consumer & Community Banking division, card services and auto lending have been growth drivers, reflecting resilient consumer spending. Asset & Wealth Management has also been a bright spot as continued net inflows boosted fee income.\r\nSome of the key financial metrics that stood out in the first quarter include a 2% year-over-year increase in average loans and deposits, while JPMorgan's book value per share rose 12% compared to Q1 2024, reaching $119.24.\r\nAlthough it may have been business as usual for the bank in the first quarter, the outlook has grown increasingly uncertain. Officially, the bank is guiding for full-year net interest income of $94.5 billion, a 1% increase from last year. However, this number isn't etched in stone, since it depends on the rapidly changing macroeconomic environment. For now, the escalating trade tensions present an operational and financial headwind.\r\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration announced a major U.S. trade policy overhaul, implementing a 10% baseline tariff on most imports, with significantly steeper tariffs on specific countries like China. Although Trump has since rolled back some steps, pausing higher reciprocal tariffs for 90 days for most countries and allowing for some exceptions, experts warn that the measures may still cause economic disruptions. JPMorgan's chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli now estimates a 50% recession probability, indicating that the bank is taking the risks seriously.\r\nWhile it's too early to fully assess the effects of the tariffs, the widespread market confusion as companies across all sectors adjust to the new environment has several implications for JPMorgan's outlook.\r\nImage source: Getty Images.\r\nThere are already indications that mergers and acquisitions have stalled, with dealmakers taking a wait-and-see approach. Companies are likely to reassess hiring plans or push back on major capital investments. For JPMorgan, this means a potential slowdown in its core investment banking business and commercial lending.\r\nIf a recession does materialize, the consumer banking side of the business would be particularly hard-hit, as loan defaults rise, adding to credit losses. Even with some areas of the bank, such as trading, possibly benefiting from the market volatility across equities and fixed income to offset declines in fees elsewhere, the risk to earnings is tilted to the downside.\r\nAll this is happening while shares of JPMorgan don't necessarily stand out as a great bargain. Across multiple metrics including the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.6 and price-to-book (P/B) value of 2.0, JPMorgan continues to trade at a premium relative to its average valuation multiples over the past five years. One interpretation is that if conditions deteriorate, the stock has room to fall further.\r\nJPM PE Ratiodata byYCharts.\r\nAmongbank stocks, few rival JPMorgan's strong fundamentals and disciplined capital management, offering shareholders a source of portfolio stability even in a severe economic downturn. A swift de-escalation of trade tensions through clearer policies or negotiations could catalyze a stock rebound. For now, I'm not convinced shares are a buy, and a cautious wait-and-see approach remains prudent.\r\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisorservice hasmore than quadrupledthe performance of the S&P 500 since its inception in 2002*, and the analyst team knowswhen to double down.

On the morning of the 9th, Trump posted on social media that it was a “great time to buy.” About four hours later, he announced he was suspending tariffs, propelling the S&P 500 index to a 9.5% gain, its biggest rally since 2008.\r\nGreene’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\r\nGreene, one of the first lawmakers to file a disclosure since Trump announced his tariffs, is an active trader in stocks, filing eight disclosures so far this year. She’s been particularly bullish on the semiconductor and tech industries. Her sale of Treasuries, though, was the first time she’s sold after buying more than $500,000 of the government-backed securities since the beginning of 2025.\r\nCongressional Democrats have urged investigations into whether people connected to Trump profited from the timing of the tariff announcements.\r\nIn a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she did not know which officials may have had advance knowledge, but called it “unconscionable” that insiders may have profited from the market volatility.\r\nThe disclosure reports only require members to list values of transactions in broad ranges, and do not contain specific times of execution or cost basis, so it’s unclear precisely how many of Greene’s trades happened before Trump broke the news of the tariff pause.\r\nBut at least $11,011 to $165,000 in purchases came on April 8. As of 11:20 a.m. Tuesday in New York, shares of Blackstone, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Tesla traded higher than at any point on that day.\r\nOver the two days, her stock purchases totaled $21,021 to $315,000. She sold $50,001 to $100,000 of US Treasuries on April 8.\r\nAmong the other names in Greene’s purchases were chipmakers Nvidia Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., along with apparel companies Lululemon Athletica Inc. and Nike Inc."

The market’s third borrower Tuesday, Japanese financial firm Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., priced $3 billion of notes.\r\nThe longest portion of Wells’ offering, an 11-year security, yields 1.28 percentage point above Treasuries, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified as the details are private. Goldman’s longest portion, a six-year tranche, yields 1.25 percentage point above Treasuries, a separate person said.\r\nMorgan Stanley, JPMorgan Lead $16.5 Billion Bank Borrowing Spree\r\nIt’s common for the biggest US banks to sell debt shortly after releasing quarterly results. But there were some questions this go-around after the primary market froze earlier this month in the wake of an evolving global trade war.\r\nTuesday’s deals received orders 3.3 times the amount of bonds sold, according to Bloomberg’s Brian Smith, compared with 3.8 times on Monday.\r\n“Clearly there’s appetite for sizable bank issuances,” said Peter Simon, an analyst who covers the sector at research firm CreditSights. “We don’t see much evidence that the market is overly concerned with these banks, which makes sense given their results have been solid this quarter.”\r\nGoldman reported record revenue in the first quarter, while Wells Fargo’s report pointed to soft loan demand amid the ongoing tariff uncertainty. Wells’ net interest income, the difference between what it makes from lending and pays for deposits, fell short of analysts’ projections. Still, non-interest expenses were better than forecast as Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf works to cut costs.\r\nIn the high-grade market, banks have underperformed in recent weeks, with TD Securities credit strategist Hans Mikkelsen writing that was likely due to expectations of new debt sales. The average bank bond spread widened 24 basis points this month through Monday, more than investment-grade notes overall while yields for the latter briefly hit 11-month highs last week."

He substantially lowered his price target on the \"Big Four\" U.S. bank last week, yet he remains bullish on its prospects. Here's a detail or several about his new take on the company, and whether his positive outlook is warranted.\r\nCFRA's Kenneth Leon published an update on JPMorgan Chase following thebank's unveiling of itsfirst-quarter resultsFriday morning. As in preceding quarters the lender did well, posting solid year-over-year growth on both the top and bottom lines, and topping the consensus analyst estimates for both.\r\nYet like the rest of the world's businesses, JPMorgan Chase is currently sailing in unfamiliar waters. This was the crux of Leon's price target reduction, according to reports. The analyst wrote that he was narrowing his equity risk premium on the stock due to the currently high level of global uncertainty around U.S. trade policy.\r\nNevertheless, Leon was very complimentary about the bank's trailing performance. In his view, all of JPMorgan Chase's businesses demonstrated robust health during the quarter, with its commercial and investment bank division especially benefiting from recent market volatility.\r\nWith all this considered, Leon cut his price target to $260 per share, from his former $310. As that's nearly 12% higher than the company's most recent closing level; but he maintained his buy recommendation.\r\nIt can be tough to stay bullish on a business so exposed to the whims of the global economy. JPMorgan Chase, though, has a very solid balance sheet and a management team that knows how to earn coin in even the most turbulent times. I think maintaining a bullish stance is the smart move with this stock, and I'd be a buyer at the current discount price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inJPMorgan Chase, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andJPMorgan Chasewasn’t one of them.

Revenue also rose at all of these banks. Trading revenue alone jumped 17% to more than $36 billion.\r\nMany banks said their consumer customers were still spending, defaults were still manageable, and businesses were not experiencing distress despite the uncertainty about the months ahead. None of the institutions with big Wall Street footprints updated their earnings outlooks for the rest of the year, either.\r\nWhat these results didn't include, however, was the volatile period that followed Trump's April 2 \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement, which took place two days after the quarter ended. Stocks and bonds plunged and have yet to fully recover, ushering in new uncertainty about the economy and the safety of US assets.\r\n\"We're surprised about the degree of ongoing firmwide strength at all 5 big banks ... and the more than expected upbeat views,\" said Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo in a Tuesday note.\r\n\"To us, it all says that events since Apr 2 can still be little more than a speed bump, so long as policy moves faster to help ease most of the uncertainty,\" he added, in reference to promised deregulation of the banking industry expected from the Trump administration.\r\nNot that banks and their top executives were entirely upbeat. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said that the prospect of a recession \"has increased.\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the economy faces \"considerable turbulence,\" with a recession as a \"likely outcome.\"\r\nIn such a scenario, he added, \"earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down.\"\r\nBut many bankers were noticeably more optimistic. The word \"recession\" did not come up once on Citigroup's Tuesday earnings calls with analysts. Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, also offered an optimistic vision of the current turmoil."

      "body": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you cansign upto receive in your inbox every morning along with:\r\nThe chart of the day\r\nWhat we're watching\r\nWhat we're reading\r\nEconomic data releases and earnings\r\nThe American growth trade as we know it — juiced by AI might, hopes of a soft landing, and coming deregulation —may have fallen away. But an outgrowth of shifting tariff policies has sparked another lucrative exchange on Wall Street: the volatility trade.\r\nAsurge in trading activityhas shuttled billions of dollars to the nation’s largest banks as investors have attempted to protect their money or deploy it in the face of market gyrations.\r\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo'sTermsandPrivacy Policy\r\nEarnings reports from the big five banksin recent days revealed they collectively raked in nearly $37 billion in trading revenue this past quarter, touting record sales from equities changing hands.\r\nWarren Buffett famously urged investors to “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” A corollary for the financial institutions facilitating those trades is to sit back in any environment and collect fees.\r\nWall Street wants stocks to go up, sure, but most importantly, it just wants stocks to move.\r\nThe big banks' trading may mostly be for hedge funds, pensions, and large companies — big institutional investors. But everyone's rolling up their sleeves at the volatility and tinkering with their portfolios, looking to optimize or take advantage of the moment.\r\nAs my colleagueJosh Schafer reports, everybody's trading. Dip-buying flows following the week of “Liberation Day” reached record levels, according to data from VandaTrack, including $3 billion in net purchases on April 3. That was the largest daily total since VandaTrack began collecting the data in 2014.\r\nBuying at recent lows and FOMO trading explained much of the heightened activity. But another interpretation is that an entire class of retail investor has been trained to throw their cash into stocks in a continuation of a pandemic-era shift in personal finance.\r\nYou are probably better off not looking at your diminished 401(k) account when the market is convulsing. But pushing an order on a trading app has become something of a pastime for an increasingly large American demographic, the foundation for group chats among young people, and the basis for an entire genre of aspirational lifestyle content.\r\nThat big banks' big shot clients are doing this too is a great \"stars, they're just like us\" moment. But it's also part and parcel of the same volatility that's been a hallmark of the 2025 stock market and a lesson in the importance of a diversified portfolio of banks' business lines."

      "title": "Trump energy boss’s company plunging 40% is a warning for US oil production",
      "body": "Energy Secretary Chris Wright says Donald Trump’s administration is giving the “green light” to more US oil production, but the signal from the fracking company he used to run is flashing bright red.\r\nLiberty Energy Inc. (LBRT), which Wright led until his appointment to Trump’s cabinet, has tumbled 43% this year, one of the most precipitous declines among US energy stocks. The value of Wright’s stake in Liberty has fallen by nearly half to about $30 million over that period.\r\nLiberty’s rout is a warning that all is not well in America’s shale patch, despite Trump’s pledge to achieve “energy dominance.” Oil field servicers often provide the first indication of an industry downturn because they’re the ones hired to drill and frack new wells. After the trade war and OPEC’s recent decision to hike production knee-capped crude prices, investors expect US shale producers to avoid pumping more barrels into an oversupplied market.\r\nA drop in spending on services means US oil production could stall, or even decline this year, for the first time since the pandemic. So far, servicers are getting the brunt of the impact from tariff fears: An index of the companies has slid 28% this year, compared with 7% for oil and gas producers.\r\n“It’s just going to be painful,” said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at energy-focused financial services firm Pickering Energy Partners. “What comes next, and we’ve already heard whispers of this, it will be slowing down of drilling activity, releasing frack crews.”\r\nLiberty is due to kick off earnings season for oil field servicers on Wednesday after the market closes, with larger rivals Halliburton Co. (HAL), Baker Hughes Co. (BKR) and SLB (SLB) to follow next week.\r\nOil field service companies are largely dependent on producer spending on drilling and fracking new wells for their income, leaving them uniquely vulnerable to downturns. Producers like Diamondback Energy Inc. and Devon Energy Corp., by contrast, can continue to earn revenue from their existing wells. Plus, they have the option of hedging oil prices and renegotiating for lower-cost drilling contracts.\r\nEven before tariffs, servicers had been suffering from lower demand as shale producers become more efficient, which means fewer drilling days and workers to do the same job. Investors will find out soon if further cuts are coming as contracts inked before the trade war expire and producers respond to the slump in crude prices.\r\nWest Texas Intermediate crude oil, the US benchmark, closed at $61.33 on Tuesday, down 14% this year.\r\n“We would not be surprised to see US oil output decline” if low prices persist, Barclays Plc analysts led by Amarpreet Singh wrote in a note to clients on Friday."

These simple reforms could lower the cost of mortgages by 70–80 basis points.\"\r\nThis push for reform comes as JPMorgan's mortgage volume fell to $11.2 billion in the first quarter ending March 31, down from $14.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, home lending from the bank's retail channel fell to $9.4 billion from $12.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.\r\nOther banks have also struck a similar tone during recent conference calls following quarterly earnings.\r\nBank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan told investors during the company’s first quarter earnings call this week that he is hopeful for change as new policymakers take office.\r\n\"It’s critically important that we get this rebalance,\" Moynihan said. \"Sometimes the regulation gets in the way of that.” At Bank of America, home lending held steady at $254 billion in the first quarter, unchanged from the previous quarter.\r\nWells Fargo (WFC) CEO Charles Scharf echoed Dimon’s sentiment, telling analysts last week that the bank supports the administration’s deregulatory push. Scharf said the proposed changes would allow \"more loans, take more deposits, and provide more liquidity to the markets while preserving robust regulatory oversight.\"\r\nWells Fargo’s mortgage volume fell to $4.4 billion in the first quarter ending March 31, down from $5.9 billion the previous quarter, further underscoring the broader slowdown in housing financing activity.\r\nData from the National Association of Realtors showed pending home sales, a forward looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings, grew 2% in February.

Some top leaders have expressed to me that the tariffs are putting their businesses into a state of chaos.\r\nBessent added, \"They'll [CEOs] also have clarity on tax and on deregulation. I remember in 2017 I heard a lot of the same things because the tax deal wasn't done until right before Christmas in 2017. And it was the same thing. We can't plan. We can't do this. We need clarity. So, you know, we're going to have clarity on tax. We're going to have clarity on deregulation.\"\r\nRead more:What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\r\nCorporate America has sounded the alarm on the state of the economy amid the tariff turmoil.\r\nJPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said in a recent TV interview that a recession is likely. Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon told analysts on his earnings call on Monday that the prospect of a recession has increased.\r\nBessent's hedge fund mentor Stanley Druckenmiller has weighed in onXthat he doesn't support tariffs above 10%.\r\n\"Well, the consumer is concerned about a number of things ... the pricing and costs of things, inflation,\" Constellation Brands (STZ) CEO Bill Newlands told me on Yahoo Finance'sCatalysts. \"They're concerned about immigration, particularly consumers that have had friends or family who have been involved with issues around immigration. How that's translating is that people are spending less. They're out less in restaurants. They're spending less on consumer goods and consumables.\"\r\nThe Corona and Modelo beer maker has seen beer sales go flat amid the economic uncertainty.\r\nBessent said about the recession concerns from Dimon and Solomon: \"Look, that's their job is to be concerned. But again, I think that there is all this chatter on tariffs and what we're worried about. And, you know, I come from Wall Street, I think Wall Street can continue to do great, but we are focused on Main Street.\"\r\nThe concerns from CEOs have been well placed.\r\nOn April 9, the Trump administration announced a 90-day pause on all reciprocal tariffs, with the exception being China.

      "body": "Madison Millsand Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick examine some of today's trending tickers.\r\nNvidia (NVDA) stock is falling after the company warned that new US chip rules on exports to China would cost the company $5.5 billion. Analysts at Bank of America, Piper Sandler, and Raymond James lowered their price targets for the chipmaker stock.\r\nApple's (AAPL) India suppliers shipped $2 billion worth of iPhones in March ahead of US President Trump's tariffs.\r\nWall Street's top financial firms, like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS), saw record-high trading revenue in the first quarter, driven by tariff-fueled market volatility.\r\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\r\nIt's now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Nvidia, Apple, and Wall Street banks. First up, several Wall Street firms cutting their price targets on Nvidia stock after the chip maker disclosed that it anticipates a $5.5 billion charge from new chip curbs. The US government told Nvidia earlier this month it would need a special license to export certain chips to China. Analysts at BFA Global Research, Piper Sandler, and Raymond James all lowering their price targets on the news. And also, Steve, what I also thought was really interesting here is an analyst over at City talking about how it's not just about Nvidia. This could also impact Broadcom. This could also impact other chip names in the space.\r\nWell, you're seeing them, you're seeing them sell off today. I mean, you know, AMD announced an $800 million charge along in there. Um, you know, Broadcom was trading lower this morning as well. ASML was trading lower, although they released earnings, but, but they're all, they're all part and parcel of this. This is not good news for the chip sector, because, you know, I, I don't mean to just sound like a broken record, but this is uncertainty, and uncertainty, the markets don't love uncertainty.\r\nWell, speaking, speaking of uncertainty, let's get to another name we're looking at. Apple's main suppliers in India shipping roughly $2 billion worth of iPhones in March ahead of President Trump's reciprocal tariffs announcement. That is according to new customs data. Smartphones have since secured a temporary reprieve from tariffs, but persistent tensions between the US and China threaten the iPhone maker's China-focused supply chain in the longer term. The Wall Street Journal reporting Apple is investigating moving some iPhone production to the US, but the process could take years, and CEO Tim Cook has said in the past that it would be difficult to find the skilled labor in America that's needed to build the smartphones. Treasury Secretary Scott Beson dismissed that comment and concern in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\r\nYou don't need a PhD in mechanical engineering to assemble an iPhone. So, I, I'm not sure why Tim Cook says that the skills aren't here.\r\nAnd Steve, I think what analysts who cover Apple might say and investors might say is that that skilled labor does take years to build up, and it's certainly something that allows Apple to turn out these iPhones incredibly quickly.\r\nWell, that's it. I mean, every, you know, labor now is not just, you know, pounding a hammer or nail. There, there's, there's, there's intricacies in the supply chain. You know, I, I know that, you know, the commerce secretary with his comment, you know, we're going to have lots of people screwing tiny little screws into things. That's not what people really want. You know, we want the high-tech value-added manufacturing because, quite frankly, our cost basis is higher. So, if there's value-added stuff to be done, that's great. If it's just, if it's just bringing low-skilled labor, bringing back low-skilled jobs, that's not necessarily, you know, I understand the need for that, particularly maybe in some strategic industries, but overall, I think we want people bringing a skill set to it. You know, I saw a statistic, this was posted on, on, on Twitter by my friend Frank Luntz who I trust. Um, and he got the statistics from the Cato Institute. 80% of the people when asked, said, do you want more manufacturing in the US? 80% said yes. When asked, would you take a factory job? 75% said no. 23% said yes. The other two said I already have a factory job. So, it, it's, you know, it's one of these, it's nice in theory, but in practice, um, you know, you need skilled, the people who are going to take these jobs, by definition, are really going to be skilled labor. Not, not just, you know, people, not just, you know, automatons screwing in screws.\r\nYeah. Right. The price that they're requiring for their labor requires it to be skilled. All right. Finally, trading desks at some of the biggest names in banking crashed in, cashed in, rather, on market volatility in the most recent quarter. And that is not including the past two weeks, which fell outside of that reporting period. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Goldman, all seeing record equity trading revenue during the quarter. Despite the blockbuster results, executives did express some caution about the current macro backdrop. JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon warning of considerable turbulence roiling the US economy. Well, Goldman's David Solomon said the prospects of a recession had increased. You couldn't pay Solomon to mention the word tariffs, but he did semi-maybe allude to it in that comment. Is this trading revenue for banks a signal of strength in your view, Steve? Or is this something that can kind of hide any economic macro concerns?\r\nKind of the latter. You know, I remember I spent the bulk of my career as an option trader, and I used, I loved environments like this. Um, you know, and to Jamie Dimon's comment, you know, about turbulence, you know, I always described VIX as sort of the price of a parachute when the plane hits turbulence at some level. You know, people want that protection. But here's what happens during volatility with, if you're an active trader. You widen your spreads, you shrink your sizes. So, effectively that really impairs liquidity, but if you're the person trading off those bid offs, bid-ask spreads, each trade you do is more profitable. And so, yes, that leads to the trading desks making more money, but really, you know, analysts typically discount that over time. It's actually a little odd this quarter that the analysts are very happy that the banks are making all this money trading because for years, again, as a trader at a publicly traded firm, the analysts were always very dismissive when we had a good quarter.\r\nYeah. Right, right, because it's potentially not a sign of continued gains for, for the banks. Steve, thank you so much for sticking with us. For our audience, you can scan the QR code below to track the best and worst performing stocks with Yahoo Finance.\r\nExactly. My pleasure."

The practice, known ascheck-kiting, is illegal.\r\nAccording to a Tuesday court filing in Gwinnett County, Georgia, seen byCNBC,one “masked man” deposited a $73,000 check in the defendant’s Chase bank account. Per the lawsuit, the check bounced six days later, but not before the defendant made a series of cash withdrawals worth $82,000. The defendant allegedly owes Chase nearly $58,000 and has not complied with requests to return the cash.\r\nJPMorgan has filed five total lawsuits on the state level: one each in New York, Florida, Georgia, and two in Texas, the company confirmed toFortune. Since October, when JPMorgan first pursued litigation on the issue, the company has sent out more than 1,000 letters to customers asking them to repay the funds.\r\n“We’re still investigating cases of fraud and cooperating with law enforcement—and we’ll do that for as long as it takes to hold fraudsters accountable,” JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Drew Pusateri toldFortunein a statement.\r\nChase’s ATM woes aren’t unique. In August 2023, Bank of Ireland customers took advantage of anATM glitchthat allowed them to pull large sums of money from their accounts and transfer up to €1,000 (~$1,090) to other accounts, even if the funds were more than what was available in their accounts, leading them to mistakenly think they were getting “free money.”"

He is in a wait-and-see mode given all the uncertainty in tariff standoff.”\r\nThe rally in bonds also followed a solid $13 billion sale of 20-year bonds, which was awarded at 4.81% compared with a 4.814% when-issued yield at the 1 p.m. New York time bidding deadline.\r\nEarlier, data showed US retail sales rose substantially in March on a jump in car purchases and other goods such as electronics, suggesting consumers were scrambling to get ahead of tariffs.\r\nIn sharp contrast with the state of market a week ago, when Trump’s about-face on tariffs shook investors, futures volumes on Wednesday were well below recent levels. By about 3 p.m. New York time, Treasury contracts were running at about 60% of 20-day average, with SOFR futures at a similar level.\r\nTo Gregory Faranello, head of US rates trading and strategy for AmeriVet Securities, the Treasury market is now trading more cleanly than it was earlier in the month as the risk of global tariffs raised threats to the economy, undermining Treasuries’ reputation as the world’s safest asset.\r\n“Positions feel better balanced, so back to a risk-off” market, he said. Faranello favors five-year notes “if the Fed is going to be reactionary versus preemptive.”\r\nPowell’s Message\r\nPowell’s comments, delivered at the Economic Club of Chicago, were in sharp focus across Wall Street after a bout of volatility in the $29 trillion Treasury market."

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\r\nKey Points\r\nInvestors are looking for solid dividend stocks with volatility returning to the markets. There are several top stocks offering yields much better than theS&P 500average of 1.44%, but some of these businesses are struggling competitively and are only offering high yields because their share prices have collapsed.\r\nIt's ideal to find high-yield stocks of strong companies that are delivering solid financial results and showing share price appreciation potential. Here are two dividend payers that are doing just that.\r\nCoca-Cola(KO-0.19%)has historically weatheredrecessionswell. It has increased the dividend for 63 consecutive years after recently increasing its quarterly payment by 5% to $0.51. It's a great option for someone looking to boost their portfolio's average yield with relatively low risk.\r\nCoca-Cola generates a significant portion of its annual revenue from making concentrate syrup for its trademark brand. This is a capital-light business model that churns out robust profits. The company's profit margin has remained above 20% over the last five years.\r\nDespite choppy consumer spending behavior, global unit case volume grew 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 1% for 2024. The company continues to adjust its marketing strategy and capitalize on its knowledge of local markets globally to drive sales. The company has been particularly effective at linking its beverages to different occasions, such as music or food, that resonate with consumers.\r\nThe stock has climbed 20% over the last year, and it currently offers aforward dividend yieldof 2.88%. Analysts expectCoca-Colato grow earnings at an annualized rate of 6% over the next several years. Combined with the high yield, investors can expect to earn an average annual return around 9%, which is slightly less than the historical return of the S&P 500 but with the advantage of earning a much higher dividend yield.\r\nLeading wireless service providers are very resilient in recessions. Eliminating a phone or internet payment plan is probably the last thing people are going to cut in a recession. Shares ofAT&T(T-1.85%)have climbed about 59% over the last year, driven by healthy demand for wireless phone plans and high-speed internet service.\r\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is818%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\r\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now…\r\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\r\nAT&T cut its dividend in 2022 to shore up funds to service its debt. The company's current quarterly dividend is $0.2775, bringing its forward yield to 4.2%. Instead of increasing its dividend, management has left the dividend unchanged as it focuses on paying down debt and investing for growth.\r\nIt's normal for telecoms to use a lot of debt, since they benefit from regular monthly bills from customers, which provides a high level of certainty for annual revenue and cash flows. The company's debt has declined from $177 billion in 2021 to $123 billion in 2024, while paying out less than half itsfree cash flowin dividends over the past year.\r\nAT&T entered 2025 with momentum. It reported 1.7 million postpaid phone net additions last year, which refers to the monthly bills people pay for wireless service. The company also added 1 million AT&T Fiber net additions for the seventh consecutive year.It aims to keep pressure on competitors by focusing on delivering quality service and good deals.\r\nThe company generated more than $17 billion in free cash flow last year on $122 billion of revenue. The 4.2% forward yield, combined with management's optimism that it can growAT&T's business to increase the share price, makes this an excellent income investment for 2025 and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inCoca-Cola, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andCoca-Colawasn’t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.\r\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, described the 145% duty on China as so extreme that it essentially acts as an embargo rather than a conventional tariff.\r\n“We now have 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, a number that high frankly isn’t really a tariff. It’s more of an embargo. Almost nobody’s gonna pay that much of a markup. It’s a recipe for losing money.”\r\nREAD ALSO10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar RecentlyandJim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks\r\nCramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump’s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. “As a nation, shamefully, we’ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,” he said\r\n“I think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.”\r\nCramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. “Yes, we have to take them on now or never,” he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept.\r\n“So the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it’s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it’s not worth it to go back… [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I’m actually thinking that might be where we’\r\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10.

      "body": "Coca-Cola(KO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\r\nShares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +3.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.6% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coca-Cola belongs, has gained 1.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\r\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\r\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\r\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\r\nCoca-Cola is expected to post earnings of $0.72 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\r\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.96 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\r\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.19 indicates a change of +8.1% from what Coca-Cola is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\r\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Coca-Cola."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar.\r\nOn Thursday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer cautioned viewers about what may lie ahead once the 90-day pause on new tariffs comes to an end. While discussing the latest Consumer Price Index report, Cramer acknowledged that the numbers looked favorable, with inflation appearing relatively tame and even some categories experiencing actual price declines. He pointed to energy prices, saying, “The best, anything it touched energy, which is plummeting.”\r\nREAD ALSO:Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocksand10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently.\r\n“This is essentially an embargo. President Trump’s ecstatic that the tariffs are already taking in $2 billion a day. He’s thrilled that supposedly 75 countries are begging for something more reasonable than the 90-day pause when the 90-day pause comes to an end.”\r\nAccording to Cramer, President Trump is “ecstatic” that these tariffs are already generating $2 billion a day in revenue and is thrilled about 75 countries “supposedly” asking for something more workable once the 90-day grace period concludes. Despite the seemingly positive revenue flow, Cramer expressed concern over the broader consequences. He pointed out that many Americans have yet to grasp the full impact of trade policies that have allowed foreign businesses to flood U.S. markets with inexpensive products, often pricing out domestic companies.\r\nWhile many consumers embraced the lower costs, Cramer reminded his audience that it came at the expense of American jobs. “Now we’re going to have to pay a price. He stressed that consumers should be prepared to pay significantly more for a wide range of goods. He said that the additional cost largely will likely benefit foreign companies, which will hike prices in response to the tariffs imposed on them. He clarified his position by stating he is not a staunch advocate of free trade for its own sake. “No other country plays by the rules on trade, so we shouldn’t either,” he said but cautioned:\r\n“We just have to be more thoughtful about this or we’ll end up doing more harm than good. Again, as someone who wants fair trade, not free trade, I am rooting for the president to pull this off, but not at the expense of great American companies that have done nothing wrong and are the best in the world.”\r\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\r\nKey Points\r\nWarren Buffett is famous because of the long-term success he has achieved runningBerkshire Hathaway. But there are two interesting things about this company. First, it is run kind of like a mutual fund. Second, it doesn't pay dividends despite the fact that Buffett often invests in dividend-paying companies. Here's why that matters and why you might want to buy one of these three dividend payers he owns.\r\nOne of the core tenets ofBuffett's investment approachis to buy good companies when they are attractively priced. But the next step is to hold for the long term so he can benefit from the growth of the businesses he buys. One of the nuances that gets lost in this is that he uses the cash generated from the companies he owns outright or owns in Berkshire Hathaway's common stock portfolio to reinvest in his business. That allows him to compound those cash flows over time and this enhances the returns he generates for investors.\r\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\r\nFrom a big-picture perspective, you can do the same thing bydividend reinvesting. All it takes is a phone call to your broker, or, more likely, a button press on your broker's website or in its app. And in one quick and easy move you'll be investing more like Warren Buffett.\r\nBut what if you want to invest even more like Oracle of Omaha? Well, three dividend-paying stocks he owns today areCoca-Cola(KO-0.19%),Chevron(CVX0.65%), andKraft Heinz(KHC-2.00%). Here's a look at these three Buffett stocks to see if they'll be a good fit for your Buffett style dividend reinvesting.\r\nCoca-Cola is a very easy company to like. It is the industry-leading beverage company with a globally diversified business. It is large enough to have economies of scale in distribution, marketing, and research and development, and it can, and does, act as an industry consolidator. The dividend has been increased annually for over five decades, making ita Dividend King. The dividend yield is 2.9%, which is well above the market's yield today.\r\nFor conservative dividend investors it is a solid choice. The only problem is that the stock looks a little expensive at the moment, with both the price-to-sales andprice-to-earningsratios above their five-year averages. However, if you are willing to pay a premium for income security, Coca-Cola could be a good fit for your portfolio.\r\nAnother industry leader in Buffett's portfolio isenergygiant Chevron. It is one of the largest integrated energy companies you can buy, with a business that spans from the upstream (energy production) through the midstream (pipelines) and into the downstream (chemicals and refining). This diversification helps to soften the impact of the inherent swings in the commodity-driven energy sector. On top of that, the company has a very strong balance sheet, which allows it to take on leverage during industry downturns to support its business and dividend.\r\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is818%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\r\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now…\r\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\r\nThe dividend, notably, has been increased annually for 38 years thanks largely to Chevron's solid business model. That said, energy price volatility still has a material impact on the stock price. Right now energy prices are weakening andthe dividend yieldis a very attractive 4.7%. The yield could go higher if oil prices continue to fall. But the history here suggests that the dividend will continue to get paid even if oil prices continue to fall. You could try to time your entry into Chevron, but the truth is it is a strong energy choice at just about any point of the energy cycle.\r\nThe last big dividend stock on this list is Kraft Heinz. It is a toughconsumer staples stockto love when you compare it to Coca-Cola. Yes, Kraft Heinz's dividend yield is a lofty 5.3%, but the dividend has been static since it was cut in 2019. The big story is the business overhaul that's taking place.\r\nThe company was created via the merger between Kraft and Heinz. The goal at that time was to cut costs to boost profitability. But cutting costs can only take a company so far before it needs to refocus on growth. That's what Kraft Heinz has been doing, after turning to a new management team. But the results haven't been particularly impressive, which is why the dividend has been stuck in neutral for so long. If you consider this high-yield food maker you'll need to go in understanding that it is aturnaroundstory that will require extra monitoring. It's probably only appropriate for more aggressive investors.\r\nWhile Buffett owns Coca-Cola, Chevron, and Kraft Heinz in his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, you don't actually need to own these specific stocks to benefit from dividend reinvestment. These are just three stocks to get you thinking about the real investment tool that's important here, which is the reinvestment of dividends so you can compound your returns over time -- just like Buffett does with his investments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inChevron, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andChevronwasn’t one of them.

Operating in the consumer staples space, consumers tend to keep buying its products right through periods of stock market and economic turmoil. That's how Coca-Cola has managed to support and grow its dividend through the years despite often material headwinds.\r\nWhile Coca-Cola is an elite company, it is far from the only consumer staples maker that can help you rest easy amid stock market unrest. Here are a few others.\r\nIf the stock market falls into a bear market are you going to stop buying toothpaste, toilet paper, and soda? If the economy succumbs to a recession, will you stop using soap, laundry detergent, and food? That answer, I hope, to those two questions is no. And this is whyconsumer staples makersare so attractive during troubled times (if not all the time).\r\nImage source: Getty Images.\r\nMany of the products that companies like Coca-Cola sell aren't actually necessities. In this case you could just drink tap water instead of soda. However, the cost of most consumer staples products is fairly modest while the benefits are material, even if those benefits are really just emotional. Brand loyalty tends to run high in the consumer staples niche. Even better, consumer staples products are bought frequently because they get used regularly.\r\nIf you are having trouble sleeping at night amid market uncertainty, you should consider adding some more consumer staples stocks to your portfolio mix.\r\nCoca-Cola is a solid choice for highly conservative investors. It has an above-market dividend yield of 2.9% backed by a dividend that has been increased annually for more than 50 years, making this beverage gianta Dividend King. The company has a global distribution network, strong R&D skills, and massive marketing heft. The only problem is that the stock looks a little expensive right now, with its price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios both above their five-year averages. If you're willing to pay up for safety, you might want to buy Coca-Cola.\r\nButbeveragepeerPepsiCo(PEP-1.88%)has similar business strengths and a more diversified portfolio that includes snacks and packaged foods. It is also a Dividend King. However, the real attraction lies in its valuation, with PepsiCo's P/S and P/E ratios both below their five-year averages. Its dividend yield is an even higher 3.7%. And with PepsiCo investing in growth through bolt-on acquisitions, it is continuing to grow its business with the same playbook that has worked well for more than five decades.\r\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is818%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\r\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now…\r\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\r\nThat said, you might want something a little different.Unilever(UL0.61%)could be just what you are looking for, with its portfolio of consumer products and food. The big story with Unilever is that North America and Europe only make up around 40% of its top line, with the rest coming from Latin America and Asia, where economic growth is expected to be higher over the long term. Add in a 3.1%dividend yieldand this is an attractive consumer staples option for those with a more adventurous bent.\r\nThen there are ultra high yielders likeAltria(MO-0.40%)andBritish American Tobacco(BTI-1.21%). Both of these cigarette makers are facing material long-term headwinds as the volume of the cigarettes they sell has been in decline for years. However, smokers tend to be very loyal and often increase their use of cigarettes during uncertain times. During the coronavirus pandemic, both Altria and British American Tobacco put up their strongest volume numbers in years.\r\nWhile these twotobacco companiescome with material long-term risks, the short-term benefit of collecting Altria's 7.2% yield and British American Tobacco's 7.5% yield might be worth it for some investors. Given the nature of cigarettes, those lofty yields are likely to be safe over the near term.\r\nAlthough all of the companies listed here are attractive in their own way, the list is hardly exhaustive. There are many more consumer staples stocks that are worth looking at if you are worried about the market and feara recession. While there is no way to fully avoid the impact of either of these big-picture events, buying companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Unilever, Altria, and British American Tobacco can help ease your worries and let you rest a little better thanks to their reliable businesses and dividends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inCoca-Cola, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andCoca-Colawasn’t one of them.

Meanwhile,JPMorganis even more bearish. Its recession model sees a nearly 80% chance the economy goes into a recession, up from 60% not long ago.\r\nRecessions tend to cause corporate profits to decline, which drives many companies to cut costs through layoffs and other initiatives. Some companies will even cut or suspend theirdividend paymentsto shareholders to conserve cash.\r\nHowever, other companies are more recession-resistant due to the durability of their cash flows and the strength of their balance sheets.ExxonMobil(XOM1.04%)andCoca-Cola(KO-0.19%)have proven their ability to weather recessions over the decades. They've both increased their dividends throughout at least the past four recessions. There's a good chance they can withstand the next one with similar ease.\r\n\r\nXOM Dividenddata byYCharts. Gray bars are recessions.\r\nExxonMobil hiked its dividend payment by 4% earlier this year, extending its streak to 42 years of annual payment increases. \"We're proudof the factthat we've increased our annual dividend per share for 42 years in a row, something only 4% ofS&P 500companies can claim,\" stated CFO Kathy Mikells during the oil giant's fourth-quarter earnings conference call. She continued, \"And we plan for that track record to continue for decadesto come, which is only possible by investing in the high-quality growthopportunities that drive leading returns and higher cash flows.\"\r\nThe energy company has been investing heavily in transforming its business to dramatically improve its underlying earnings power whilealsoexpanding into lower-carbon energy. This strategy has boosted its earnings capacity by nearly $14 billion over the past five years on a constant price and margin basis. Exxon plans to invest over $140 billion into major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program through 2030, which, along with structural cost savings, should add another $20 billion to its annual earnings capacity.\r\nThat incremental income will give Exxon even more fuel to grow its dividend, which is already on an incredibly safe foundation. Last year,Exxon produced $34.4 billion in free cash flow, easily covering its $16.7 billion dividend outlay. Meanwhile, it has a fortress balance sheet with an ultra-low 6%leverage ratioand a massive $23.2 billion cash balance. These factors put the oil giant's 3.8%-yielding dividend on a rock-solid foundation that should continue withstanding recessions.\r\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is818%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\r\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now…\r\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\r\nCoca-Cola boosted its dividend payment by 5.2% earlier this year. That extended its dividend growth streak to 63 straight years. That raise kept Coca-Cola in the ultra-elite group ofDividend Kings, companies with 50 or more years of annual dividend increases.\r\nThe company has benefited from the durable and growing demand for its beverage brands. Its portfolio features multiple billion-dollar brands that generate lots of free cash flow for the company. Coca-Cola expects to produce $9.5 billion in free cash flow this year, more than enough to cover its dividend outlay ($8.4 billion last year). The company also has a strong cash-rich balance sheet ($12.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments) with leverage at the low end of its target range.\r\nCoca-Cola's long-term target is to organically grow its revenue by 4%-6% annually, which should drive mid-to-high single-digit earnings-per-share growth. Meanwhile, the company can enhance its growth rate by making accretive acquisitions. That puts it in a strong position to continue increasing its2.9%-yieldingdividend.\r\nExxon and Coca-Cola have increased their dividendsevery yearfor several decades,which includesthe last four recessions.They're in excellent positions to continue raising their payout during the next downturn, whetherthat happenslater this year orfurtherin the future.Because of that, they're great dividend stocks to buy for a durable passive income stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inExxonMobil, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andExxonMobilwasn’t one of them.

      "body": "We recently published a list of11 Top Performing European Stocks So Far In 2025.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (NASDAQ:CCEP) stands against other best performing European stocks to invest in.\r\nThe world economy is hanging by a thread, as the macroeconomic environment consists of trade wars, retaliatory tariffs, and political unrest in Ukraine and the Middle East. It adds to economic uncertainty, with market experts offering cautious economic forecasts. According to EY, the euro area will experience a modest economic turnaround in 2025, and growth is expected to increase from 0.7% last year to 1.3% and 1.8% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. It is forecasted to simmer down to 1.4% in 2027. Among all European countries, Malta is projected to experience the highest GDP growth in 2025 at 4%. EY expects soft employment growth across Europe, driven by demographic challenges and subdued labor demand. Unemployment will likely remain at 2024 levels. While nominal wage this year will clock in higher than pre-pandemic levels, wage growth will take a hit. Central and Eastern European countries are forecasted to experience relatively higher inflation in 2025, while the overall rate remains just over 2% in the euro area.\r\nMeanwhile, German economic institutes have slashed their growth projections for 2025 to 0.1% from the previous forecast of 0.8% in September 2024. This revised estimate does not incorporate the recent tariffs levied by the US. These tariffs will be a major setback for European economies, possibly toppling them over the edge of recession for the third consecutive year. The new conservative government declared a €500 billion fund to improve infrastructure and defence and stimulate growth. The fiscal package enhances the economic outlook for 2026 and 2027.\r\nHowever, as the United States is feeling the pressure from high valuations and growing political instability, analysts are looking towards Europe as a better bet for stock investors. Analysts point towards Europe offering a more stable outlook, with lower stock prices, clearer policy direction, and even potential interest rate cuts on the horizon. Investors seem to be shifting their focus, partly because the threat of US tariffs on Europe, especially on automobiles, feels less uncertain now that details are clearer. There is also less exposure to tech in Europe, which is seen as a good thing right now. Europe’s markets, with just 10% tech exposure in the Europe 600 compared to 30% in the broader market, look more balanced."

For many investors, especially retirees, capital preservation has been top of mind. How can you keep your savings safe and still be invested in the stock market -- or is that even possible nowadays?\r\nOne blue chip stock you may be considering isCoca-Cola(KO-0.19%). Thebeverage companyis known for its robust results and resiliency over the years. Can it be a good investment right now and be a way to help keep your portfolio safe?\r\nA huge advantage Coca-Cola has over other businesses is that it operates all over the world. That gives it flexibility. For example, President Donald Trump recently announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. But Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said that the company could adjust and use other packaging materials, such as plastic, to minimize the impact of those tariffs.\r\nThe company also has strongmargins. Last year, Coca-Cola reported $10.6 billion in earnings on sales totaling $47.1 billion, which equates to a profit margin of nearly 23%. Even if there's an increase in costs, the company's strong profit margins put it in an excellent position to continue delivering solid earnings numbers. Coca-Cola, however, hasn't been a fast-growing business recently; from 2022 through 2024, its earnings grew by just 9%.\r\nThe last time the stock market was in a prolonged free fall was 2022. Growth stocks cratered amid concerns about rising inflation. Coca-Cola stock, however, proved to be a fairly safe investment at the time. Including its dividend, the stock's total returns were more than 10%, far better than the S&P 500's.\r\n\r\n^SPXdata byYCharts\r\nHistorically, Coca-Cola has been a low-volatility stock to own, as it has averaged abetaof 0.45, indicating that it doesn't follow the market's swings. For investors seeking safety right now, that can make this an attractive investment. But it's important to remember that the past doesn't predict the future, and while Coca-Cola was able to pass on rising costs to consumers amid high inflation in recent years, it may not be as easy to do that now with many consumers feeling stretched.\r\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If you just want to collect a good, safe dividend, this can be one of the better investments to consider putting in your portfolio today. Coca-Cola's business is rock solid and isn't going anywhere. It provides a dividend that yields 2.9% and can generate a lot of recurring income for you.\r\nThe only downside is that its growth prospects may not be all that strong, but this could still be an ideal stock to own if you're looking to keep your risk low and want some stable dividends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inCoca-Cola, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andCoca-Colawasn’t one of them.

      "body": "Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Coca-Cola's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\r\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 48% ownership\r\nInsiders have sold recently\r\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\r\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 64% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\r\nAnd things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$15b in market cap last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 27%.\r\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Coca-Cola, beginning with the chart below.\r\nSee our latest analysis for Coca-Cola\r\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\r\nWe can see that Coca-Cola does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Coca-Cola's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\r\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Coca-Cola is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.3% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.4% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.1% of the company stock."

      "title": "Coca Cola Vs PepsiCo  Which Consumer Giant is Built for the Future ",
      "body": "In the consumer goods space, few rivalries are as iconic or enduring as the one betweenThe Coca-Cola CompanyKO andPepsiCo Inc.PEP. These two titans have been battling it out for more than a century, not just on supermarket shelves but across airwaves, billboards and now digital screens. While the rivalry was once defined by the cola commercials and the taste tests, the modern battlefield is far more complex — a competition spanning global market share, diversified portfolios, strategic agility and shareholder value.At first glance, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo may seem like mirror images: both are massive, globally recognized brands with deep roots in American culture and omnipresent product lines. But dig deeper, and you will find two fundamentally different companies. Coca-Cola is a beverage purist, focused solely on liquid refreshment, while PepsiCo has evolved into a diversified powerhouse, balancing beverages with an empire of snacks and packaged foods. Their strategic paths, investment philosophies and long-term visions diverge — and it is this divergence that makes the comparison so compelling for investors.This face-off is not just about which brand tastes better; it is about which business performs better. From market share and financial strength to innovation and sustainability, we will break down how each company stacks up in the real metrics — business strategy, revenue performance, portfolio depth, stock valuation and long-term potential.Whether you are a fan of fizz or a believer in balance, the data may surprise you. Let us step into the ring and see who really has the edge.\r\nCoca-Cola has long been the undisputed king of the global beverage industry — a brand so iconic that it is often the first name that comes to mind when people think of soft drinks. Commanding a 43% share of the global carbonated soft drink (CSD) market, Coca-Cola has maintained its dominance by staying laser-focused on one thing — beverages. This singular focus has allowed the company to build a powerhouse portfolio of more than 500 beverage brands, ranging from the legendary Coca-Cola Classic to innovations like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Smartwater, and its growing investments in coffee and energy drinks.What sets KO apart is its asset-light franchise model, in which it owns the brands and marketing muscle while outsourcing bottling and distribution to strategic partners. This model delivers high operating margins, scalability and a strong free cash flow — key ingredients for its long-standing reputation as a dividend aristocrat. The company currently yields a steady dividend of around 3%, backed by resilient cash flows even in volatile markets.Strategically, Coca-Cola has been pivoting from sugary sodas to healthier, functional and premium offerings. From acquiring Costa Coffee to expanding Fairlife’s high-protein dairy products, Coca-Cola is reimagining itself as a broader wellness beverage company. KO is also doubling down on emerging markets, where per-capita consumption is still relatively low but rapidly rising, creating a significant long-term growth opportunity.In a world of growing health consciousness, Coca-Cola is working hard to future-proof its brand by focusing on low and no-sugar alternatives, innovative packaging, and digital transformation through data analytics and AI-driven marketing. Its long-term goals are grounded in sustainability — achieving 100% recyclable packaging by 2030 and becoming water-neutral, which resonates with the next generation of socially conscious consumers.For investors, Coca-Cola offers a compelling blend of stability and slow-burning global growth. Its strong brand equity, disciplined capital strategy and exposure to high-growth regions make it a resilient pick for long-term portfolios, especially for those seeking reliable income and a defensive play in uncertain economic times."

      "title": "The Coca Cola Company (KO)  One of the Best Dividend Monarchs to Invest in Now",
      "body": "We recently published a list of the10 Best Dividend Monarchs to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other best dividend monarchs.\r\nDividend-focused investors are generally well-acquainted with terms like Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Kings, but many may not be aware of a lesser-known group called Dividend Monarchs. While they fall under the broader category of dividend growth stocks, they carry a distinct title. The Dividend Monarchs Index highlights US companies that have managed to raise their dividends consistently for at least 50 consecutive years. These firms have weathered decades of market ups and downs, showcasing both resilience and steady performance in terms of dividend growth and stock returns. As an evolution of the well-known S&P Dividend Aristocrats Index Series, the S&P Dividend Monarchs Index sets an even higher standard, recognizing a more exclusive tier of long-term dividend payers.\r\nS&P Dow Jones Indices has been a pioneer in dividend growth strategies since the 1980s, initially tracking US companies with at least 10 years of dividend increases. As the number of such companies grew, the threshold was raised to 25 years, forming the basis for the Dividend Aristocrats Index, launched in 2005. This index became a widely recognized benchmark, eventually expanding to include mid- and small-cap stocks as well as global markets. By April 2023, over $40 billion in ETF assets tracked these indices. With a rising number of companies now surpassing 50 consecutive years of dividend growth across different market caps, S&P introduced the Dividend Monarchs Index in 2023 to reflect this new elite group.\r\nThe key distinction between Dividend Kings and Dividend Monarchs lies in the inclusion criteria. While both require at least 50 consecutive years of dividend increases, Dividend Monarchs must also meet specific standards set by S&P. To qualify for the Dividend Monarchs Index, a company must be part of the Composite 1500, have a float-adjusted market capitalization of at least $2 billion, maintain a three-month average daily trading value of $5 million or more, and consistently grow its dividend over five decades. This added layer of eligibility makes Monarchs a more selective, index-based group.\r\nCompanies that meet the tough 50-year dividend growth requirement tend to show strong profitability and financial stability. According to an S&P Dow Jones Indices report dated April 30, 2023, the Dividend Monarchs Index outperformed both the broader market and the S&P Composite in terms of return on equity (ROE) and showed more consistent earnings. The report also noted that, based on back-tested data since January 31, 2018, the Dividend Monarchs Index displayed more defensive traits—offering lower volatility and smaller drawdowns than the S&P 500 during market declines."

      "title": "Coca Cola (KO) Stock Moves  0.25%  What You Should Know",
      "body": "Coca-Cola (KO) closed the latest trading day at $71.68, indicating a -0.25% change from the previous session's end. This move was narrower than the S&P 500's daily loss of 2.24%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.73%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 3.07%.\r\nShares of the world's largest beverage maker have appreciated by 3.57% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 1.31% and the S&P 500's loss of 4.17%.\r\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Coca-Cola in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on April 29, 2025. In that report, analysts expect Coca-Cola to post earnings of $0.71 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 1.39%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $11.14 billion, indicating a 1.44% decline compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\r\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.96 per share and a revenue of $47.99 billion, representing changes of +2.78% and +1.98%, respectively, from the prior year.\r\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Coca-Cola. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\r\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\r\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.01% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. At present, Coca-Cola boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\r\nLooking at valuation, Coca-Cola is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 24.3. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 18.74, which means Coca-Cola is trading at a premium to the group.\r\nIt's also important to note that KO currently trades at a PEG ratio of 3.88. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. KO's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.72 as of yesterday's close."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.\r\nThe market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump’s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year.\r\nThe year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios.\r\nIn the second month of 2025, the US government’s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States’ tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services.\r\nDW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods & services in the latest round of “Trump Tariffs”. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering “continuous stagflation”, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment.\r\nThis scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children’s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children’s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President & CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing:"

Chili’s says in a press release that its version has 85% more beef, making it “even more value-packed” than the fast food classic.\r\nThe Big QP is being added to Chili’s popular “3 for Me,” a $10.99 meal that includes the burger, fries, unlimited chips and free refills of a soft drink. The deal exploded in popularity last year when Chili’s took aim at customers of its fast food rivals (notably McDonald’s)  who might be turned off by theirrising prices.\r\nAnd while the meal might be more expensive than a McDonald’s Quarter Pounder, which costs around $5 to $7 depending on the city, it’s comparable in price to a combo meal with medium fries and medium-sized soft drink.\r\nChili’s directly jabbed McDonald’s in its press release, calling the $10.99 deal “less expensive than a comparable meal at McDonald’s” as well as releasing TV ads that call the Quarter Pounder “tiny.”\r\nThe Big QP is the second McDonald’s-inspired burger from Chili’s. Last year, the chain added a Big Mac-like burger called the Big Smasher, rolling out acheeky ad campaignthat directlycalled out the Big Mac. Ultimately, that proved a successful gambit, with the Big Smasher helping Chili’s register a 15% jump in same-store sales following its release.\r\nChili’s is likely hoping to sustain its skyrocketing sales by continuing this rivalry. Sales in its most recent quarter jumped 31%, marking the chain’s third-straight quarter of double-digit growth. Shares of Brinker International (EAT), its parent company, have soared 200% over the past year.\r\nRelated articleChili’s and Applebee’s are fighting about their value meals\r\nOnce trailing flashier rivals, Chili’s ispulling off its comebackthanks to these deals, plus revamped chicken tender recipes and viral TikToks of its “Triple Dipper” appetizer. The chain also recently opened a location in Scranton, Pennsylvaniainspired by “The Office.”\r\nThis success stands in contrast to most casual dining chains. Typically catering to lower and middle-income families looking for a sit-down meal, diners have been abandoning these companies in recent years.These restaurantshave been hiking menu prices at the same time their customer base is being squeezed by the rising cost of living, resulting in several bankruptcies, including Hooters, TGI Fridays and Buca di Beppo.\r\nAlthough McDonald’s hasn’t directly responded to Chili’s, the chain recently added a“McValue” menu categoryin hopes of turning around its sluggish sales. In addition to the$5 meal deal, the menu also has a “Buy One, Add One for $1” option and more locally targeted promotions from its franchises.\r\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

This strategy supports the company’s continued performance despite challenging conditions. In 2024, McDonald's opened 2,116 restaurants, an increase from 2,067 in 2023. This growth reflects the company’s focus on expanding its global footprint through the Restaurant Development pillar of its Accelerating the Arches Strategy.Going forward, McDonald's aims to accelerate its pace of restaurant openings to meet growing demand across key markets. In 2025, the company plans to open 2,200 restaurants globally, contributing more than 4% to new unit growth, net of closures.

The stock is trading above the Zacks Retail-Restaurant industry’s average of 25.12X and the broader Retail-Wholesale sector’s 22.11X.The warning signals come as restaurant chains, including peers likeBrinker International, Inc.EAT,McDonald's CorporationMCD andYum!

Looming macroeconomic risks, concerns around inflation, retaliatory tariffs, and rising labor costs are beginning to cast a shadow over CMG’s near-term prospects.\r\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\r\nSo far this year, shares of Chipotle have declined 18.1% compared with the Zacks Retail – Restaurants industry’s fall of 1.5%. The stock has underperformed the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s and the S&P 500’s declines of 5.7% and 8.4%, respectively.\r\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\r\nFrom a technical perspective, Chipotle stock is currently trading below its 50-day moving average, signaling a bearish trend.\r\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\r\nAnalysts and investors alike are starting to question how sustainable Chipotle’s momentum is under these conditions. Let’s find out.\r\nMacro Pressures Are Building:The broader economic environment is starting to catch up with even the most resilient players. Inflation remains sticky, interest rates are still elevated, and consumers are becoming more price-conscious. As a premium fast-casual brand, Chipotle is particularly vulnerable to this shift.Declining profitability remains a concern for CMG. During the fourth quarter of 2024, Restaurant-level margins contracted 60 basis points year over year to 24.8%, weighed down by rising input costs and portion-related investments. Despite promises of back-half relief from initiatives like produce slicers and back-of-house modernization, management expects margin pressure to linger into the first half of 2025.While many restaurant chains are seeing signs of consumer trade-down behavior, Chipotle has continued to raise menu prices to offset inflationary pressures. This strategy worked well during earlier waves of inflation, but there are signs that consumer tolerance for higher prices may be peaking. The brand's value perception is at risk, especially as grocery inflation moderates and home cooking becomes a more attractive alternative for budget-minded customers."

(NYSE:ARCO) stands against other top restaurant stocks to buy under $20.\r\nRestaurant stocks are showing volatility amid Trump’s tariff impositions across various sectors. On April 7, CNBC reported that while US stocks are tumbling due to the effects of high tariffs on the import of goods from key trading partners, analysts do not anticipate the tariffs to hit most restaurant stocks directly. However, inflation is expected to follow behind, fueled by expert and investor fear of an impending recession. This may put pressure on the spending capacity of consumers, resulting in an economic downturn.\r\nCNBC reported that UBS analyst Dennis Geiger said the following in a note to clients:\r\n“We view the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants as manageable, with a focus on select commodity costs, but see the bigger risk as incremental pressure on consumer spending and industry demand.”\r\nCNBC also reported that investor concerns affected restaurant stocks across all sectors. Fast food restaurant chains have historically shown the most resilience during recessions, as consumers looking for cheap dining options typically level down from fast-casual or full-service diners and eateries to fast food options. However, the drop in consumer spending witnessed last year saw fast food restaurants hit hard, as low-income consumers cut their spending to this sector, visiting them less frequently. High-income consumers, on the other hand, continued with their usual dining habits, creating a gap that negatively affected fast food companies. Quick-service restaurants thus underwent same-store sales declines.\r\nOn March 8, Mario Carbone, Major Food Group chef and co-founder, appeared on CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ to discuss the effects of Trump’s tariffs on the food industry and how high-end consumers are behaving in the sector. Talking about New York, he said that the numbers are booming, going above their pre-Covid benchmarks. New York is thus telling us that everything is good, and there is no fear right now in dining in the luxury sector. Stats are up, and restaurants are packed, with consumer energy through the roof. As of right now, there are no signs of slowing at all if one evaluates the spending and trends in restaurant reports.\r\nHowever, Carbone said that inflation hits the food and restaurant industry just like everyone else. The luxury food sector is responsible to the customer for bringing in the best ingredients for every meal, which is why it has no choice but to pass the effects on to the consumer in case such trends materialize."

      "body": "(Bloomberg) — Technology stocks sank as new US government restrictions on the export of Nvidia Corp. chips to China and a disappointing report from ASML Holding NV fanned trade war concerns, wiping out $155 billion in market value for the two companies alone.\r\nMost Read from Bloomberg\r\nHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?\r\nTrump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space\r\nLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs\r\nNvidia (NVDA) fell as much as 7.1% in US premarket trading after the chipmaker warned it will report around $5.5 billion in related charges during the fiscal first quarter, contributing to a 1.4% decline in Nasdaq 100 futures. Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML (ASML) slid as much as 7.6%. The selloff in semiconductor stocks over the past three months has already wiped out about $2 trillion in market capitalization.\r\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration has barred Nvidia from selling its H20 chip in China, an escalation of Washington’s tech battle with Beijing. ASML later added to investor anxiety by posting orders that missed expectations and saying that it doesn’t know how to quantify the impact of recent tariff announcements.\r\nThe latest developments show how tariffs are already wreaking havoc on global companies, while the trade war is extending beyond mere import taxes as well. The fallout could weigh on chip-sector earnings and also set back China’s ambitions to compete on the global tech stage. ASML’s drop weighed on Europe’s technology sector, with losses across chip equipment peers pushing the Stoxx 600 Technology Index about 2.5% lower.\r\nThe H20 restrictions are “driven by concerns over China’s rise in the electronics sector, and in that sense, it is likely to become a permanent policy,” said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management. “It is expected to have a significant negative impact on semiconductor supply chain.”\r\nTrump’s war on trade is prompting economists to scale back their forecasts for GDP growth worldwide, casting doubt over the outlook for everything from smart-phone demand to computing. Even before Washington slapped additional tariffs on much of the world — only to roll them back shortly after — many industry analysts had questioned whether big tech firms from Microsoft Corp. to Meta Platforms Inc. will continue to buy Nvidia Corp. chips at the same pace in 2025.\r\nAmong key suppliers, Korean memory maker SK Hynix Inc. slumped 3.7% Wednesday. Top foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 2.5% ahead of results on Thursday. Japanese chip-equipment maker Advantest Corp. (6857.T) dropped 6.6%, extending its fall after ASML’s statement."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc.

He suggested the administration was being careful not to hand over competitive advantages to Southeast Asian rivals, particularly Samsung:\r\n“So what I saw today, and not to be facetious, but what I see is people saying, you know what, we’ve seen the downside. Maybe we can test it again. But the president has, I don’t want to say blink, because that’s nonsense. What the president did was say, OK, look, we’re not going to continue to punish American companies and give the green light to Korea. I don’t know if you heard Lutnick’s words. He was very specific.

Instead, he argued that a softer dollar actually benefits American multinationals and gives long-needed relief to CFOs who’ve spent years blaming currency strength for lost market share:\r\n“Well, look, I’m not so certain I’m going to do a little contrary stuff on the dollar here. When we listen to conference calls, for the last four years, all we hear about is it would have been so much better if the dollar weren’t so strong. We keep losing share, the dollar’s too strong. Suddenly the dollar’s weaker, and now we start hearing all the downside, what, the bonds? I mean, I’m almost thinking that, I’m gonna put this out there, the people who are saying that it’s the end of the world, that the dollar is weaker, I think they have to go do some work boots on the ground. […] So suddenly the dollar’s weaker and we are petrified? These are people who have an agenda. And their agenda is to say, you know what matters more than anything else? Our hegemony from a strong dollar. And I don’t get it. If you’re in our business of picking stocks, you’re sick and tired of hearing CFOs say, we are done. We’ve got to stop this dollar rise.”"

      "body": "By Jody Godoy\r\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified this week at a high-stakes trial in Washington where the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is seeking to unwind Meta's acquisitions of prized assets Instagram and WhatsApp.\r\nHere are five key moments from his testimony.\r\nBREAKUP CONSIDERED\r\nZuckerberg in 2018 floated the idea of spinning off Instagram amid mounting pressure on Big Tech from antitrust regulators, in a sign of how seriously he took the threat of precisely the type of claims Meta now faces.\r\n\"I wonder if we should consider the extreme step of spinning Instagram out as a separate company,\" he said in a document shown at trial. \"While most companies resist break ups, the corporate history is that most companies actually perform better after they've been split up.\"\r\n\"INSTAGRAM WAS BETTER\"\r\nSeeking to explain messages in which he worried that Instagram was a competitive threat, Zuckerberg said the app's camera was simply better than camera features Meta had developed.\r\n\"We were doing a build vs. buy analysis\" while in the process of building a camera app, Zuckerberg said. \"I thought that Instagram was better at that, so I thought it was better to buy them.\"\r\nThe comments appeared to bolster FTC claims that Meta chose to buy out rivals rather than compete. Meta argues that Zuckerberg's motivations do not matter because it does not have a monopoly.\r\nSOCIAL MEDIA CHANGING\r\nThe FTC claims Meta monopolizes the market for social networks where users share with friends and family. A key piece of Meta's defense is that the social media landscape has changed vastly since it bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, and even since the FTC brought the case 5 years ago.\r\nZuckerberg testified that now around 20% of content on Facebook and 10% on Instagram is generated by users' friends as opposed to accounts they follow based on interests.\r\n\"People just kept on engaging with more and more stuff that wasn't what their friends were doing,\" he said.\r\nALL-AD FEED\r\nPurchasing Instagram diminished competition and let Meta manipulate the service in ways that benefited the company and not users, such as by boosting the number of ads, the FTC argues. More competition would result in better outcomes for users, such as pressure to show fewer ads, the FTC has said.\r\nZuckerberg defended ads, saying Meta's system is designed to \"show more ad content to people who like seeing ad content.\"\r\nHe suggested that Meta has even contemplated introducing a feed consisting entirely of ads."

(NASDAQ:META) stands against other Reddit stocks with high potential.\r\nOn April 15, Monica Guerra, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Head of US Policy, joined ‘Closing Bell Overtime’ on CNBC to discuss how investors should avoid knee-jerk reactions when it comes to volatility. Monica Guerra pointed out the significance of focusing on President Trump’s statements, as they contribute to market volatility despite their mixed and unclear nature. She acknowledged that deciphering his comments is challenging because they lack clarity but staying attentive to both presidential statements and congressional actions is still crucial. She stressed that policy certainty might emerge once Congress finalizes the budget, which is expected around August this year.\r\nShe also emphasized that while the day started positively with markets up by 0.79%, the situation otherwise remains uncertain. She reminded clients that the 90-day reprieve on tariffs is not the end of the story and the ongoing studies on semiconductors could lead to additional pressures related to tariffs and market volatility. Guerra noted that tariff revenues are being considered as funding sources for tax cuts and this interplay between tariffs and taxes could influence market volatility. On discussing future developments in tariff policy, she mentioned that more than 70 countries have approached President Trump in attempts to renegotiate the universal 10% tariff and reciprocal tariffs. She cautioned that even if reciprocal tariffs are eliminated and only the universal tariff remains, additional increases could be highly inflationary. China’s effective tariff rate is already at 145% and adding reciprocal tariffs could push inflationary pressures further.\r\nGuerra advised clients against reacting impulsively to such news and encouraged them to focus on long-term investment goals.\r\nWe sifted through Reddit threads to make a list of the top stocks with the highest analysts’ upside potential (at least 30%) as of April 15. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their upside potential. We have also added the hedge fund sentiment for each stock, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers.\r\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here)."

He eventually increased it to $1 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal, but FTC boss Andrew Ferguson wouldn't accept anything lower than $18 billion.\r\nThe revelations about Zuckerberg's attempts to settle with the Trump administration add a new layer of drama to the legal battle between the social media giant and the FTC, whichallegesMeta became a monopoly in the market for \"personal social networking\" by buying up potential rival social media startups such as Instagram and WhatsApp.\r\nMeta's Facebookacquired Instagram in 2012 for $1 billionandWhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion.

But Ferguson and the Justice Department's antitrust chief, Gail Slater, persuaded Trump to support their recommendation to proceed to trial.\r\nThis week in court, the FTC wasted no time laying out evidence against Zuckerberg by calling the CEO as its first trial witness.\r\nInstagram became the FTC's central topic as prosecutors confronted Zuckerberg with his past emails.\r\nIn a 2012 email, Zuckerberg told Facebook's then-CFO, David Ebersman, that purchasing Instagram and other startups could be viewed as a way for Facebook to buy time.\r\n\"Even if some new competitor springs up, buying Instagram, Path, Foursquare etc. now will give us a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again,\" Zuckerberg wrote, according to an account of the testimonyreportedby Bloomberg.\r\nZuckerberg agreed under questioning by the FTC's attorney that buying Instagram was intended to \"neutralize a competitor,\" but he added that the purchase was also meant to boost Facebook's quality and functionality."

      "body": "Apple (AAPL) stock fell nearly 4% on Wednesday, sending the iPhone maker's market capitalization back below $3 trillion as tariff pressures continue to weigh on the company after shares had enjoyed what some analysts called a \"relief rally\" earlier in the week.\r\nApple stock surged to start the week, leading the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks higher as investors cheered the Trump administration's temporary tariff exemptions for tech products announced over the weekend.\r\nThe \"relief rally,\" as Citi's Atif Malik put it, briefly put Apple's value back above the $3 trillion mark after falling to its lowest value in almost a year last week at just under $2.6 trillion.\r\nApple is still the world's most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft (MSFT).\r\nUS Customs and Border Protectionissued regulations late Fridayexempting consumer electronics — and almost all of Apple's products — from reciprocal tariffs.\r\nOn April 2, Trump announced global reciprocal tariffs that would go into effect on April 9.\r\nRead more:The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\r\nThe presidentinstead announced a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariff plan last Wednesday— with the exception of a 145% reciprocal tariff on Chinese imports, a development cheered by Apple investors. Some 90% of Apple's iPhones are made in China.\r\nApple had shed more than $770 billion from its market cap between April 2 and April 8.\r\nApple's decline on Wednesday comes afterNvidia(NVDA)disclosed late Tuesday that the Trump administration had effectively banned exports of its H20 chips to China.\r\nNvidia's disclosure followed reports thatTrump had been set to back off plans to restrict Nvidia's chipsdesigned for China to comply with US trade rules.\r\nTo Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, these developments show that there are “many conflicting opinions within Trump's team on the issue of tariffs, strategies against China and US tech restrictions.\"\r\n\"The concern about Apple is that it will become harder to avoid the crossfire between the US and China as tariffs and restrictions come into play,\" DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an email.\r\n\"The [export] restrictions on chips that came out from NVIDIA represent an escalation in the trade dispute.\"\r\nTech stocks fell across the board Wednesday, with the Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropping 3%.\r\nFellow Magnificent Seven stocks Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) also sank, falling nearly 4%, while Nvidia plummeted almost 7%.\r\nTrump also set the stage to tariff semiconductors this week —the Commerce Department opened a probe into computer chips Tuesday under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which grants the president the ability to impose levies on imports due to national security. And Trump has promised that most electronics will still get wrapped up in his tariffs, which could hurt Apple."

(NASDAQ:META) stands against other best blue chip stocks to buy according to billionaires.\r\nThe US stock market is showing volatility after President Donald Trump’s recent announcement of sweeping 10% tariffs on all US trading partners and higher tariffs on countries with a trade deficit with the US.\r\nEconomists and investors believe President Trump’s tariff policies could potentially lead to a trade war with America’s trading partners, propelling inflation even higher. These two factors could plunge the US into an economic slowdown, and the markets could potentially sell off quickly if a recession materializes among its looming threats.\r\nOn April 10, CNBC reported that stock prices rose sharply a day before after declining for four days straight following President Trump’s announcement of a pause in a significant part of his tariff plan. The White House said that Democratic lawmakers were indulged in partisan games by inquiring if any stock market purchases conducted in recent days were undertaken with prior knowledge of the fact that President Trump would authorize a pause in his tariff plans. Trump announced higher tariffs on China even after he announced a 90-day pause for steeper-than-baseline rates for several other countries.\r\nREAD ALSO:10 Best Medical Stocks to Buy According to Billionairesand10 Best Organic Food Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires.\r\nOn April 11, Erica York, economist and the vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy, talked to CNBC’s “The Exchange” about the ongoing scenario and said that the imposition of around 145% total tariff on Chinese goods would result in a suspension of most trade between the US and China. She said:\r\n“It depends on how narrowly the tariff is applied or how broadly it’s applied, but generally, if you get north of a triple-digit tariff, you are cutting off most trade.”\r\nShe further opined that:\r\n“There may still be some things without any substitutes that companies just have to foot the bill, but for the most part, that cuts it off.”\r\nThe economist said that Trump’s new China tariffs, along with the others he implemented, would raise the average tariff rate to record highs the country hasn’t seen since the 1940s. The current market volatility has created numerous remarkable investment opportunities, so let’s look at the 15 best blue chip stocks to buy according to billionaires."

      "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized in federal court on Wednesday that he bought Instagram and WhatsApp because he saw value in the companies — not to take out competitors, as the Federal Trade Commission alleges in a historicantitrust trial.\r\nZuckerberg took the stand for the third day in the trial, wrapping up his testimony as the first witness Wednesday afternoon. He took questions from Meta attorney Mark Hansen, who has argued that his client hardly has a monopoly in social media, as the FTC claims, and still faces stiff global competition.\r\nHansen focused some of his questioning on emails sent by Zuckerberg and his associates that the FTC cited in earlier testimony to illustrate the Facebook founder's alarm over the growth of Instagram and his sense that he needed to neutralize its threat.\r\nZuckerberg said he’s very focused on inventing new things, and understanding what other people are creating is a big part of the process. At any given point in his company’s history, he said, similar tones of concern could be found in emails about what other companies were doing better than his.\r\n“This is my job,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I need to understand what is going on, and I need to push our teams to move quickly” to learn about what is going on in a very competitive market.\r\nHansen questioned Zuckerberg about competition, particularly from TikTok, the popular social media site owned by Beijing-based company ByteDance, and the the growth of the video-sharing platform YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet.\r\nZuckerberg testified that people spend more time on YouTube than on Facebook and Instagram combined.\r\nWhile Hansen noted that the FTC doesn't consider YouTube to be a Meta competitor — because it doesn't have the same friend-sharing technology as Facebook — Zuckerberg said YouTube has built in ways to share videos.\r\nThe FTC contends Meta has used a monopoly in its technology that facilitates connecting with friends and family to generate enormous profits as consumer satisfaction has dropped. The case could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.\r\nDaniel Matheson, the FTC's attorney who questioned Zuckerberg, has repeatedly brought up his own words in emails to associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram to try to show Zuckerberg was more interested halting Instagram's alarming growth than improving the product.\r\nUnder questioning by Hansen, Zuckerberg insisted that he had no intention of acquiring Instagram only to slow its development and end a threat. He said the focus was on \"having it run as an independent brand.”"

      "body": "Meta Platforms (META,Financials) Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerbergtestified in a federal courtroomon Monday, defending the company's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp as the Federal Trade Commission seeks to prove the deals were part of a strategy to eliminate competition in the social networking market.\r\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with META.\r\nThe trial, which began in Washington, marks a significant legal test for federal antitrust enforcement and could potentially force Meta to divest two of its most successful platforms. Zuckerberg, called as the first witness by the FTC, addressed internal communications that the agency says reveal concerns about Instagram's rapid growth and Meta's lack of progress on similar products before acquiring the company in 2012.\r\nFTC attorney Daniel Matheson presented messages showing Zuckerberg's dissatisfaction with the company's internal efforts to compete in the photo-sharing space. Zuckerberg responded that he was highlighting performance issues rather than expressing acquisition motives.\r\nWhen asked about Instagram's treatment after the acquisition, Zuckerberg denied neglect, stating that Meta invested substantially in the platform post-purchase. He also challenged the framing of discussions about focusing on Facebook over Instagram, arguing they were not formal strategies.\r\nThe FTC alleges that Meta followed a long-standing approach of acquiring emerging competitors instead of developing rival products, referencing a 2008 statement by Zuckerberg that it is better to buy than compete. The agency says this strategy created barriers for new entrants and stifled innovation, particularly as users migrated from desktop to mobile platforms.\r\nMeta, in its defense, argues that the market is far broader than the FTC defines, pointing to competitors such as TikTok, YouTube, Apple's iMessage, and X (formerly Twitter). The company maintains that regulators cleared the acquisitions over a decade ago and that the current lawsuit undermines finality in mergers and penalizes past decisions that were lawful at the time.\r\nMeta also noted in a recent court filing that the FTC must prove the company holds monopoly power todaynot in the pastunderscoring the growth of rival services over the years.\r\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who denied Meta's request for summary judgment in late 2024, is overseeing the trial. If the court rules against Meta, the company could be required to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, a move that could cut its advertising revenue significantly."

      "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Mark Zuckerberg, the first witness in the Federal Trade Commission’s trial to break up his social media empire, gave a rare window into how he makes business decisions: by fighting for survival, even when his company is ahead.\r\nMost Read from Bloomberg\r\nTrump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space\r\nHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?\r\nWhy the Best Bike Lanes Always Get Blamed\r\nDOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on Leave\r\nLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs\r\nOver a marathon three days of testimony, the Meta Platforms Inc. co-founder and chief executive officer clearly articulated how the social media market has evolved rapidly over time — which, if the judge agrees, could make it more difficult for the FTC to prove Meta dominates it.\r\nZuckerberg was composed, but occasionally evasive, when challenged to explain past emails and other private messages indicating a concerted effort to muscle out competitors.\r\nThose old messages and emails, gathered during the pre-trial discovery process, were more damning than his present-day testimony. The messages, often between Zuckerberg and other top Meta executives, painted a picture of an executive who was paranoid about his rivals and willing to buy competitors whenever possible.\r\nThe FTC is seeking to force Meta to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that the two acquisitions have given Meta an illegal monopoly over parts of the social networking industry. Emails and documents presented at trial show that Meta, then called Facebook Inc., struggled to compete in the mobile app boom in the early 2010s, buying up successful competitors. The FTC said Meta bought the companies to eliminate direct competitive threats.\r\nMultiple Competitors\r\nZuckerberg and Meta’s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Meta faces a wide array of competitors that fight for user attention, including ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, Google’s YouTube, Apple Inc.’s iMessage and Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that TikTok, in particular, posed a “highly urgent” competitive threat when it sprang up in 2018.\r\n“We observed that our growth slowed down dramatically,” as TikTok gained popularity, Zuckerberg said Wednesday. “It was highly urgent, this has been a top priority for the company for several years.” Meta eventually rolled out a direct competitor, called Reels, that now drives a significant amount of video traffic for the company.\r\nZuckerberg was at times vague over his three days in court, and regularly disputed the FTC’s interpretations of his prior emails. As a leader, the way he communicated with staff was often blunt or harsh, and he spent time on the stand trying to add more nuance to what was written by his younger self. He occasionally clashed with the FTC’s lead lawyer, Daniel Matheson, who objected at one point that Zuckerberg wasn’t answering his questions."

      "body": "Markets\r\nHot Stocks\r\nFear & Greed Index\r\nLatest Market News\r\nHot Stocks\r\nFollow:\r\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg defended Meta’s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp on the stand this week during the start of trial over theblockbuster antitrust lawsuitbrought by the Federal Trade Commission.\r\nBut, it turns out, Zuckerberg predicted that he might find himself in this position years ago – and even proposed the idea of spinning off Instagram himself.\r\nThatwas one of several takeaways from more than 10 hours of testimony from Meta’s CEO, during which he pushed back on the FTC’s claims that the company has built an illegal “social network monopoly” by acquiring would-be rivals. The testimony painted a picture of how Zuckerberg views the competition and the company’s struggles to keep up with a rapidly evolving social media landscape that it argues has pushed users toward rivals like TikTok and YouTube.\r\nThere’s a lot at stake for Meta, as it could be forced to offload Instagram and WhatsApp if it loses.\r\nHere are the biggest takeaways from Zuckerberg, who took the stand just before former Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg testified on Wednesday.\r\nIn 2018, Zuckerberg raised concerns to other executives that “as calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway,” according to an email produced in court.\r\nIn light of that, Zuckerberg suggested spinning off Instagram because the company’s “family of apps” structure could hurt Facebook. He added: “most companies actually perform better after they’ve been split up.”\r\nOf course, Meta didn’t end up spinning Instagram or WhatsApp off, and it’s now in court fighting the FTC toavoid having to do just that.\r\nZuckerberg was indeed concerned that WhatsApp and Instagram could threaten Facebook’s dominance prior to buying the platforms, documents presented during FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson’s questioning suggested.\r\nIn 2011, Zuckerberg appeared to realize that Facebook’s now-defunct Facebook Camera service was falling behind Instagram in functionality and popularity.\r\n“In the time it has taken us to get our act together on this, Instagram has become a large and viable competitor to us on mobile photos, which will increasingly be the future of photos,” Zuckerberg wrote in an email at the time. Facebook ended up acquiring Instagram for $1 billion in April 2012.\r\nIn a 2012 email to then-COO Sandberg, Zuckerberg said then-Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer’s teams “are executing well technically but their results this year are only okay so far.”\r\n“Messenger isn’t beating WhatsApp, Instagram was growing so much faster than us that we had to buy them for $1 billion,” he wrote in the email. “That’s not exactly killing it.”\r\nThen in 2013, Zuckerberg told then-growth head Javier Olivan he worried that WhatsApp would develop features similar to Facebook and Instagram and could “start winning in the US and other markets.” Olivan responded at the time he had been having “sleepless nights” worried that WhatsApp was “the real deal.” Facebook had also been concerned around that time that Google could acquire WhatsApp before it did.\r\nBut Zuckerberg said in court Wednesday, during cross examination by Meta’s lawyer, that he thought it was “extremely unlikely” that WhatsApp would build competitive features after his first meeting with the platform’s co-founder Jan Koum.\r\nFacebook bought WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion.\r\nZuckerberg also claimed that Meta made both platforms better for users by acquiring them.\r\nZuckerberg originally built Facebook to connect and share content with friends and family. That’s the market that the FTC claims Meta now dominates.\r\nBut Zuckerberg said that kind of use of his product has been declining.\r\nThe FTC’s lawyer on Tuesday asked Zuckerberg about an internal document from 2022 that indicated “friending and friend sharing are losing steam.”\r\n“The amount that people are sharing with friends on Facebook, especially, has been declining,” Zuckerberg said. “Even the amount of new friends that people add … I think has been declining. But I don’t know the exact numbers.”\r\nBut the future isn’t necessarily the content creator-filled feeds that have become the norm on Meta’s products. Instead, Zuckerberg said, messaging between individuals or friend groups is becoming more popular than sharing content on more public social media feeds.\r\n“Messaging has been growing dramatically, and sharing with friends in feeds has been declining,” he said Tuesday.\r\nIt’s not just TikTok and Snapchat; Google’s YouTube platform is also a major rival to Facebook, the Meta CEO said on the stand this week.\r\nYouTube has indeed been capturing the attention of younger audiences;Pew Researchfound that nine in 10 US teens use YouTube, while Facebook usage has “steeply declined” over the past decade among that age group.\r\nZuckerberg attributed this in part to a rise in “richer forms of media,” like video, as mobile networks have grown more capable in the last 10 years. “YouTube is the most competitive for creators,” he said Wednesday, referring to online personalities that garner huge followings through posting videos on platforms like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.\r\n“My understanding … is that people spend more time on YouTube than on Facebook and Instagram combined, certainly more than either one independently,” he said.\r\nStill, Meta holds a firm grip on the social media market, especially in the US, according toPew Research, where it operates a quarter of the most widely-used social media platforms.\r\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

      "body": "By Arriana McLymore\r\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Chinese online marketplace Temu and fast-fashion retailer Shein, two of the biggest advertisers on U.S. social media, are sharply cutting their U.S. digital ad spending, industry data show, in a blow to tech companies such as Meta's Facebook and YouTube.\r\nThe online retailers, both of which ship low-priced China-made goods direct to U.S. shoppers, had been on an ad spree until recently, targeting younger, thriftier shoppers in digital media.\r\nU.S. President Donald Trump's executive order earlier this month threatens this business. As of May 2, merchandise valued at under $800 shipped from China and Hong Kong will no longer be exempt from tariffs.\r\nTemu and Shein plan to raise product prices next week as the removal of this \"de minimis\" exemption on import tariffs increases costs for the companies. And they are cutting ad spending on most platforms, according to two digital marketing firms that measure ad spending.\r\nTemu's daily average U.S. ad spend on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snap, X and YouTube declined a collective average of 31% in the two weeks from March 31 to April 13 compared with the previous 30 days, estimated Sensor Tower, which tracks such spending.\r\nShein's daily average U.S. ad spend on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Pinterest fell a collective average of 19% over the same period, it added.\r\nMeta declined to comment. Google, Shein and Temu were not immediately available for comment.\r\nTemu has sharply reduced ads on Google Shopping since April 12 after a marked ramp-up during the first quarter, said Mark Ballard, director of digital marketing research at Tinuiti.\r\n(Reporting by Arriana McLymore in New York City; Editing by Richard Chang)"

      "title": "3M Company (MMM)  Among the Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires",
      "body": "We recently published a list of the10 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) stands against other best value dividend stocks.\r\nDividends, though sometimes underappreciated, have significantly contributed to long-term investor gains. Between 1960 and the end of the previous year, reinvested dividends and the effects of compounding accounted for about 85% of the S&P Index’s total return. Dividend-oriented strategies offer the advantage of steady income, improved portfolio stability, and a potential buffer during uncertain economic periods—making them a strong choice for all-weather portfolios.\r\nWith ongoing tariff tensions in the US adding to market volatility, many investors have begun favoring dividend-focused approaches to strengthen their portfolios. After a stretch where growth stocks took center stage, dividend investing has started to regain traction. According to a report by Franklin Templeton, US-listed dividend ETFs recorded average monthly net inflows of nearly $3.3 billion during the six months leading up to January 31, 2025—up sharply from just $107 million during the same period a year earlier.\r\nGiven the uncertain global environment, investors have increasingly leaned toward more reliable components to maintain portfolio balance. Dividend-paying stocks—particularly those backed by strong fundamentals—have emerged as a preferred option due to their ability to generate stable and predictable cash flows. Since these cash flows play a central role in equity valuation models, determining the intrinsic value of dividend stocks typically involves less uncertainty compared to valuing growth-oriented equities. As a result, such stocks are seen as a stabilizing force within a diversified investment strategy.\r\nAccording to analysts, the strength of dividend-paying stocks lies in their capacity to cushion portfolio losses during market downturns while still providing a meaningful upside. Historically, dividend strategies have shown defensive qualities across different regions and time periods. Data for the three-year span ending December 31, 2024, revealed that dividend stocks experienced lower volatility and smaller maximum drawdowns than the broader market in global, US, and European segments. Notably, when concerns over inflation and rising interest rates resurfaced in August, dividend stocks proved more resilient than their growth-focused counterparts.\r\nHistorically, income-focused investing often leans heavily toward value stocks, as investors typically look for companies offering high dividend yields and lower valuation multiples. However, a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices points out that the Dividend Aristocrats Index strikes a balance between both value and growth characteristics. Since 1999, the index has maintained an average composition of roughly 60.5% value stocks and 39.5% growth stocks, showing no consistent bias toward either investing style. Analysts maintained that a portfolio combining strong dividend yield, consistent dividend growth, and resilience in payouts should always remain relevant. They noted that even without relying on market revaluation, the combination of income and income growth could support projected nominal gross returns exceeding 10% annually."

US stocks opening in the red this morning with tech leading the losses here. Options data showing investors are positioning for further losses in mega cap tech and semis ahead of earnings. That's according to data from Bloomberg. Joining us now with more, David Harden, Summit Global Investments CIO. David, great to speak with you this morning. Certainly a lot of pain for the big tech names this morning.\r\nThank you.\r\nAre you buying big tech at these levels?\r\nWell, I think there's some definitely buying opportunities that are coming available. For example, one of the things that I like is Google. Google has $25 billion in free cash flows last quarter. It's it's it's growing at double digits year-over-year. Its profit margins are great. Its return on equity is around 30%. And the PE is now finally getting down into those reasonable levels you can consider 16, 17, 15. So I think I think these are buying opportunities to start accumulating more positions in something like a Google.\r\nI think what you're highlighting is the, you know, this one thing is not like the other in the tech trade even as you're looking at what is more of a platform play where there's perhaps more of a reason to believe that the consumers would flow into free products that a Google might offer online versus what we're seeing in some of the products and propensity to spend in some of the other tech plays where there might be a consumer pullback in those discretionary dollars. How do you continue to look across these companies once we get into earnings and see how they're forecasting and guiding for the rest of the year on that?\r\nYeah, I think that's really important because where did their earnings come from, right? And and how are they tied to tariffs? That's really important. And how does those tariffs impact like advertising for Google. So you want to look kind of through those earnings into the consumer and and see what that consumer's doing and how that consumer's acting. And I think that's another play in tech. There is a separation. What? Are they hardware? Like Apple's had to navigate a lot more tariff news than Google's had to navigate, even though they're both navigating it.\r\nAnd we're starting to see individual companies being used as tools in this trade war. Obviously with Nvidia's specific chips being impacted by export controls, to what extent does that change any fundamental view you have on these stocks or should investors look past any of that daily headline news on tariffs?\r\nI I I think absolutely, you have to consider that and you have to manage your your risk here. Risk is really, really important in these markets and managing that is essential. So where you have the H20 chip, for example, invidia, they have clearly shown last night on their earnings that they have a difficult time more difficult time than some of these other tech names. So look for tech names that are more US based. Look for tech names that have more um say high-quality earnings. Even though somebody could question Google's high quality earnings, their earnings scores are not very good, but it is more US based. It is more consumer based in the US. And so that's very, very important in tech.\r\nIt seems like we've all been asking the question of what's the next big catalyst to drive conviction within the markets. Does that mean the AI trade or the fast-paced growth cycle for the AI trade is dead?\r\nNo, I don't think so because let's face it. Probably 10 minutes ago you were looking at AI, or I was looking at AI, or somebody was looking at some agent and the and the new things that are coming out with AI agents and things of this nature are absolutely impactful. The power of AI is growing. It's not shrinking. We're using it more. And it will continue to spread. So I think that trade's not done. I think there'll continue to be infrastructure build outs and AI things, but it has to go past just the technology. You have to look into the in industrial side of tech and where are they putting and building these centers at.\r\nI want to get to one of your cells, but first really quickly, would you buy Nvidia at these levels?\r\nUh probably not right now. No. I would be if you're if you're in it, it's time to hold and be patient. But if you're looking to buy, I think there's better opportunities to buy.\r\nAnd I know one of them is Microsoft, correct?\r\nI if you're looking at the two comparison, yes, Microsoft today, Nvidia's down more 6-7%, Microsoft's down in one, one and a half right now. I I think that's a safer play. It's a little bit more if if you will ingrained in our society. The revenues are are more um consistent. And so that's something that I would look at is more something like a Google or Microsoft. Both of those I would consider buying opportunities, especially at these levels.\r\nAnd I know a sell for you is one member of the mag 7. Talk to us about Tesla.\r\nWell, I think Tesla's had some negative earnings. We know that and um it's under pressure. I think every Tesla's uh I I saw a sticker on the back of a Tesla the other day that said something like, I bought this post crazy. So this is this is very, very important right now in our society. But having said that, I think Elon Musk is going to tell you when it's the right time to buy Tesla. And he hasn't done that yet. So he he's outspoken. We know what he's capable of. And until he's ready to let us know it's the right time to buy, I think it's you avoid that stock right now.\r\nOutside of tech, where's your favorite trade, your top idea right now?\r\nAnd I think I think outside of tech, you're going to have to look at some of the healthcare companies that have really been hurt with the Pharmatech news and other things.\r\nIt seems like they're next though in the docket for what potential tariffs may look like.\r\nOh, absolutely. So look for those healthcare companies that are not necessarily tied to pharma and they get their revenue, surgical centers and other places that are hospital-based, that are US-based, that we are going to use on a daily basis, but really are not tied to that. Those are the ones that have been kind of the baby been thrown out with the bath water. Their their valuations are very good right now.\r\nAbsolutely. David, great to see you here in studio. Thanks for taking the time with us this morning.\r\nThank you.\r\nAbsolutely."

But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during an interview with Jonathan Karl of ABC News on Sunday that the movewas temporary and only applied to Trump's reciprocal tariffs.\r\nInstead, he explained, tech products will be tariffed as part of the administration's planned duties on semiconductors, which could be announced later this week.\r\nStill, even the threat of sky-high tariffs won't be enough to force tech giants like Apple to pick up and move their suppliers to the US en masse.\r\nRead more:The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\r\n\"Anything is possible, but the setup of smartphone production in India has been a three-year process from site identification through ramped-up production, with at least another two years to achieve full supply chain integration,\" Chris Rogers, head of supply chain research at S&P Global Market Intelligence, told Yahoo Finance.\r\nIt's not just about timing. Companies would also need the workers to build devices.\r\n\"While there's a degree of automation possible and while many of the components needed are made in the US, there's still a need for tens of thousands of trained electronics assemblers willing to work long, arduous hours in highly repetitive tasks,\" he added.\r\nCompanies including Nvidia (NVDA), TSMC (TSM), Apple, and others have announced increased investments in the US to win over Trump and avoid tariffs. On Monday, Nvidia said it will produce $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years through partners including Foxconn (601138.SS), TSMC, and Wistron (3231.TW).\r\nApple also said it will spend $500 billion, and TSMC has said it will spend $165 billion. Many of those plans, however, were already in the works or don't necessarily goabove prior spending levels. Nvidia, for example, talked upbuilding chips in the US last year.\r\nAnd while that doesn't take away from the fact that the companies are pouring money into the US, it doesn't exactly support the idea that they're moving vast amounts of their manufacturing capabilities to America.\r\n\"We believe hardware companies will remain focused on accelerating US-bound product assembly out of China, and see India and Mexico as the most-likely incremental beneficiaries of these actions (we'd argue Vietnam and Mexico have been the biggest beneficiaries over the last 5 years),\" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in an investor note."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other AI stocks on the move.\r\nMarket uncertainty aside, the AI race is tighter than ever. A report by Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) states that not only has the battlefield become tighter, but also more crowded than previously. The report notes that Google and OpenAI are neck to neck in the race to build cutting-edge AI, and that other companies are fiercely closing in. Meta, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI are a few of these names. Chinese competitors are also closing in on the AI race. In particular, DeepSeek’s R1 model is very close to the top-performing models of two of the leading AI companies.\r\n“It creates an exciting space. It’s good that these models are not all developed by five guys in Silicon Valley. Chinese models are catching up as far as performance to the US models..but across the globe, there are new players emerging in the space.”\r\nIn recent news, OpenAI has launched its new AI model GPT-4.1, along with smaller versions GPT-4.1 mini and GPT-4.1 nano. These models boast major improvements in coding, instruction following, and long context comprehension.\r\nREAD NOW:10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid Market Volatilityand14 AI Stocks Catching Wall Street’s Attention\r\nAccording to OpenAI, the models outperform the company’s most advanced GPT-4o model across the board and are available only on OpenAI’s application programming interface (API). In particular, the GPT-4.1 brags a 21% improvement over GPT-4o and 27% over GPT-4.5 on coding. Moreover, there are improvements in instruction following and long context comprehension, which make these models a better choice for powering AI agents.\r\n“Benchmarks are strong, but we focused on real-world utility, and developers seem very happy.”\r\nOpenAI also noted that these models operate at a “much lower cost” compared to GPT-4.5, and that the company would turn off the GPT-4.5 preview that is available in the API in July because the new models offer “improved or similar performance.”\r\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\r\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Called BitNet b1.58 2B4T, it’sopenly availableunder an MIT license and can run on CPUs, including Apple’s M2.\r\nBitnets are essentially compressed models designed to run on lightweight hardware. In standard models, weights, the values that define the internal structure of a model, are oftenquantized so the models perform well on a wide range of machines. Quantizing the weights lowers the number of bits — the smallest units a computer can process — needed to represent those weights, enabling models to run on chips with less memory, faster.\r\nBitnets quantize weights into just three values: -1, 0, and 1. In theory, that makes them far more memory- and computing-efficient than most models today.\r\nThe Microsoft researchers say that BitNet b1.58 2B4T is the first bitnet with 2 billion parameters, “parameters” being largely synonymous with “weights.” Trained on a dataset of 4 trillion tokens — equivalent to about 33 million books,by one estimate— BitNet b1.58 2B4T outperforms traditional models of similar sizes, the researchers claim.\r\nBitNet b1.58 2B4T doesn’t sweep the floor with rival 2 billion-parameter models, to be clear, but it seemingly holds its own. According to the researchers’ testing, the model surpasses Meta’s Llama 3.2 1B, Google’s Gemma 3 1B, and Alibaba’s Qwen 2.5 1.5B on benchmarks including GSM8K (a collection of grade-school-level math problems) and PIQA (which tests physical commonsense reasoning skills).\r\nPerhaps more impressively, BitNet b1.58 2B4T is speedier than other models of its size — in some cases, twice the speed — while using a fraction of the memory.\r\nThere is a catch, however.\r\nAchieving that performance requires using Microsoft’s custom framework, bitnet.cpp, which only works with certain hardware at the moment. Absent from the list of supported chips are GPUs, which dominate the AI infrastructure landscape.\r\nThat’s all to say that bitnets may hold promise, particularly for resource-constrained devices.

The one-month return of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was 0.54%, and its shares lost 6.34% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On April 15, 2025, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock closed at $385.73 per share with a market capitalization of $2.868 trillion.\r\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q1 2025 investor letter:\r\n\"Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office365, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares detracted from performance as Azure revenue growth missed analyst estimates, marking the third consecutive quarter of modest disappointment in this segment. However, AI-related sales growth exceeded expectations, accounting for 13% of Azure’s quarterly growth. Management also maintained their fiscal third quarter earnings guidance while highlighting improved operating profitability and lower tax rates. Despite the disappointing quarter, we remain confident in Microsoft’s ability to sustain its leadership position in AI.\"\r\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\r\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is in second position our list of30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Both technology giants have deeply rooted histories in enterprise software, with Microsoft evolving from its Windows operating system foundation to become a cloud powerhouse, while Oracle built its empire on database technologies.As businesses worldwide accelerate their digital transformation initiatives, these companies continue to position themselves as essential partners in this journey. With artificial intelligence now driving the next wave of cloud innovation, comparing these two technology stalwarts offers valuable insights for investors seeking exposure to this high-growth sector.Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now.\r\nMicrosoft's cloud momentum continues to impress, with its Microsoft Cloud surpassing $40 billion in quarterly revenues for the first time in second-quarter fiscal 2025, representing robust 21% year-over-year growth. This performance demonstrates the company's successful transition from traditional software to cloud services. The Redmond-based tech giant has strategically positioned itself at the forefront of the AI revolution, with its AI business reaching an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion, growing 175% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Microsoft’s fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $275.39 billion, suggesting 12.35% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $13.04 per share, indicating a 10.51% year-over-year increase. The figure has moved south by 0.2% over the past 30 days.See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.Microsoft's strength lies in its comprehensive cloud ecosystem, spanning infrastructure (Azure), platform services, and software-as-a-service offerings. Azure, Microsoft's cloud infrastructure business, remains a key growth driver. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure combined accounted for a whopping 68% of the global cloud market in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to new data from IT market research firm Synergy.Microsoft has been steadily gaining share with fruitful strategic partnerships like one with OpenAI's APIs, exclusively running on Azure, providing Microsoft customers access to industry-leading AI models.On the innovation front, Microsoft continues to lead with groundbreaking solutions. In March 2025 alone, the company introduced several powerful innovations, including Azure AI Foundry's Responses API and Computer-Using Agent for AI-powered applications, as well as Microsoft Dragon Copilot for clinical workflows in healthcare. The company's commitment to data sovereignty is evident through its completion of the EU Data Boundary for Microsoft Cloud, enhancing its appeal to European customers.Microsoft's financial health remains strong, with operating income growing 17% in its most recent quarter. The company's strategic expansion of Copilot+ PC experiences across all major silicon platforms signals a significant pivot to increase market penetration of its AI capabilities. Furthermore, MSFT's introduction of AI agents to its Security Copilot platform addresses the escalating cybersecurity challenges facing organizations worldwide, with the company detecting more than 30 billion phishing emails and 7,000 password attacks per second in 2024."

      "body": "Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) plunge aftercomments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powelldeepened losses sparked by costs associated with new US restrictions on exports to China.\r\nFuturum CEO Daniel Newman sits down withJosh Lipton, joined by Defiance ETFs CEO and chief investment officer Sylvia Jablonski, to discuss the latest chip news and what it means for investors.\r\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere.\r\nNvidia sinking. So after the chip maker disclosed that it would take a $5.5 billion dollar hit from the US government's surprise new controls on its semiconductor exports to China. For more on the latest, let's welcome now Daniel Newman, Futurum CEO. Daniel, it is great to see you here on set. Appreciate it from Texas. Um, you know, before J. Powell, frankly, this was the story of the day. It was chips, it was Nvidia. Nvidia is down here, Dan. It's not about 10%. It's getting clobbered in today's trade. I guess two, two questions to start. One, Dan, were you surprised by that news when you saw those headlines? And two, do you think down 10%, is that move justified in your opinion?\r\nYeah, first of all, nobody should have been surprised by this move. Really the administration's been giving the signal that it was going to clamp down. Now, what was interesting is this week, there was a bit of gyration because they cut this deal, they announced 500 billion dollars of AI supercomputers being built here in the United States. And then a day later, he pulls back on this new export licensing requirement.\r\nThat that, you bring that, Dan. That is an interesting point because there were some folks who thought Jensen Wong was going to be kind of shielded from this. Right?\r\nThey made a deal. I had a few reporters actually hit me up, do you think there was some tip for tat going on. And first of all, I think Trump needs to show, President Trump needs to show that there is no tip for tat. So whether it's, you know, Tim Cook bringing more manufacturing here, whether it's TSMC coming here. But I actually think on the other side of this, and maybe we come back to this, is that I actually think creating some certainty with the, with the community, the business community, about what type of benefit they can expect by onshoring and bringing manufacturing back here. I think that would be a great start. Having said that, national security, economic security, and AI are tightly correlated. Us giving the chips to China, whether it's the tuned down chips or the best chips coming through intermediaries, which they shouldn't be getting. This is something that's giving an advantaging China. There's a lot of people out there that are like, oh, well, this is going to only push their resolve. Do you think China is waiting because we're sending Nvidia chips, they're not investing in Huawei and building their own chips? You can be absolutely certain that they are. This war, this trade war, is largely being fought on the grounds of long-term economic domination. Long-term economic domination will only be had if we control the technology trade. Nvidia is at the forefront of that trade.\r\nAnd what do you think of from an investor standpoint? Here you have Nvidia falling yet again, 8 to 10%. You know, look what happened over the last couple days. It had recovered from its lows, right? And a lot of investors who got in short term experienced that bounce. Where, where do you think that looks like this week?\r\nYeah. I, I look at that line of people around the corner at $150 that just couldn't wait to buy. And you go, what is really changed? Well, first of all, you've got GPUs melting over at, at X and at OpenAI. There's so much demand there. Could Nvidia pivot some of its capacity, not focus so much on building specialized products for China, and make sure we meet all the capacity and demand that's out there for companies that are in the US that are trying to build? You've got $325 billion of CAPEX. And it's been reiterated. So whether it's been Sunder Pichai, whether it's been Satya Nadella, they're all planning to spend. And I genuinely believe, Sylvia, that the companies with, you know, the big operating leverage are going to look at this pullback as the moment to build AI infrastructure out. Because when we come out of this, and we will come out of this, there will be deals made. Calling that on the record right now. It may be a tough couple of months. When deals are made, we will see the economy accelerate. And those companies want to build the future and have that AI infrastructure in place. So the Googles and the Microsofts and the Amazons, they're going to buy Nvidia. Um, and one other thing, if I, if I may, I find it very interesting that everybody thinks that China and their push to build Huawei is going to be so successful. When AMD came out with a competitive product, no one believed they could build the software. Broadcom's making chips for the hyperscalers and everyone said, well, that's great, but they don't have CUDA. So it's not going to work as well. But suddenly, everybody believes that China and Huawei is going to build the CUDA competitive product that's going to undo Nvidia? I believe in China, I believe in their resolve. I don't believe that they have as much competition or much competitive capability today as people are suggesting."

Yet this had less to do with its own operations, and more to do with a move by a business in which it's invested. That decline was steeper than even the gloomyS&P 500index's 2.2% fall on the day.\r\nIn an article published this morning and citing an unnamed \"person familiar with the matter,\" Bloomberg wrote that leadingartificial intelligence (AI)company OpenAI is in active talks to acquire another privately held AI business called Windsurf. The deal's price tag is rumored to be around $3 billion.\r\nWhileOpenAIis a separate entity from Microsoft, the tech giant has invested considerably in the company. It also uses its technology in a number of its products.\r\nIf a deal is reached at anywhere near the mentioned price, it would be OpenAI's priciest acquisition in its relatively short history. Windsurf is a developer of AI-assisted coding tools, which streamline the coding process by allowing users to use natural-language prompts to create programs.\r\nNeither OpenAI nor Windsurf had commented on the Bloomberg report. Microsoft had also kept mum on the matter.\r\nOf course any acquisition OpenAI makes doesn't directly affect Microsoft. The company has said, however, that it is entitled to share of profit distributions from OpenAI. Investors might feel that OpenAI -- and by extension, Microsoft -- is better off spending billions of dollars to continue developing still-fresh AI technology rather than a bolt-on acquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inMicrosoft, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andMicrosoftwasn’t one of them.

      "body": "Morgan Stanleyreduced its price targeton Microsoft (MSFT,Financials) to $472 from $530, citing weakening demand trends and cautious investor sentiment. The firm maintained its Overweight rating on the stock, with the revised target implying a potential upside of more than 22% from the prior closing price.\r\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with MSFT.\r\nIn a note to clients, analysts at Morgan Stanley said Microsoft shares have lagged behind peers in the large-cap software sector amid a wall of worry over macroeconomic and operational challenges. Slowing momentum in core segments such as Azure and Microsoft 365 was flagged as a key factor behind the downgrade.\r\nThe analysts projected Azure revenue growth of 31% in constant currency for the March quarter, down from earlier expectations of a stronger rebound in the second half. They now expect further deceleration of 100 basis points in the June quarter. Growth forecasts for Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud were also revised downward to 13.5% for the third quarter from a prior estimate of 14%, with the team attributing the slowdown to muted adoption of Copilot and lengthening sales cycles.\r\nFeedback from Microsoft's channel partners pointed to continued execution issues and a more cautious approach by customers toward large-scale technology investments, Morgan Stanley said. The firm also anticipates further downside risk to consensus earnings estimates, projecting a 1.4% reduction in forecasts for fiscal year 2025 and a 5.1% decline for fiscal year 2026.\r\nDespite these near-term challenges, Morgan Stanley emphasized that the company's long-term positioning in generative artificial intelligence remains solid. The analysts believe Microsoft shares are approaching a valuation floor and see the long-term risk-reward as favorable, estimating a 3-to-1 upside-to-downside ratio at current levels.\r\nAdditionally, the note highlighted that every 1% decrease in capital expenditures could result in a 1.5% increase in free cash flow, potentially offsetting some of the pressure from softer demand trends.\r\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025.\r\nOn April 4, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives appeared on CNBC to discuss the potential impact of current tariffs and compared the situation to an economic armageddon. If the current tariffs remain in place, Ives thinks it would lead to a 15% to 20% demand reduction across the board. He thinks that investor anxiety is much higher considering how things were in the March 2020 COVID-19 crash earlier. The analyst thinks that investors should now focus on the likelihood of tariff adjustments from comments about negotiations, the impact on consumer-focused companies, and the potential for demand destruction. He even thinks that companies may refuse to provide guidance in the first-quarter earnings calls due to the persistent tariff uncertainty.\r\nIves thinks that a lot of tech companies will not be able to absorb high tariff increases and rather this cost will be passed on to the consumers which will lead to significant margin erosion and even potential sales declines. He indicated that tech stocks are currently pricing in a 10% to 15% cut to numbers. He suggests that investors should now look at companies with strong long-term potential as he believes earnings may normalize in 2025 and 2026. The analyst also addressed the defensive performance of defense contractors. While acknowledging the relative stability here, Ives cautioned that even these even such sectors are not immune to tariffs. He noted the significant foreign component, specifically 40% to 50% in some instances, in hardware and other sectors.\r\nWe sifted through the financial media reports to compile a list of the top NASDAQ stocks to buy for 2025. We then selected the 13 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\r\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here)."

GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with MSFT.\r\nThe abrupt shift follows reports that Microsoft recently walked away from hundreds of megawatts of leased power capacity for U.S. data centers, suggesting a broader reassessment of infrastructure needs.\r\nWhile the company hasn't provided a detailed explanation, analysts point to tepid demand for generative AI services and a possible oversupply of capacity. In February, CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged AI had yet to deliver major returns, hinting at a mismatch between investment and usage.\r\nBloomberg also noted that Microsoft's evolving relationship with OpenAI may be influencing the decision. Earlier this year, Microsoft gave OpenAI the option to procure computing resources from rival cloud providers, shortly before OpenAI was linked to a separate $500 billion cloud project.\r\nMicrosoft has described the changes as part of long-term strategic planning.\r\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

      "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Mark Zuckerberg, the first witness in the Federal Trade Commission’s trial to break up his social media empire, gave a rare window into how he makes business decisions: by fighting for survival, even when his company is ahead.\r\nMost Read from Bloomberg\r\nTrump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space\r\nHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?\r\nWhy the Best Bike Lanes Always Get Blamed\r\nDOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on Leave\r\nLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs\r\nOver a marathon three days of testimony, the Meta Platforms Inc. co-founder and chief executive officer clearly articulated how the social media market has evolved rapidly over time — which, if the judge agrees, could make it more difficult for the FTC to prove Meta dominates it.\r\nZuckerberg was composed, but occasionally evasive, when challenged to explain past emails and other private messages indicating a concerted effort to muscle out competitors.\r\nThose old messages and emails, gathered during the pre-trial discovery process, were more damning than his present-day testimony. The messages, often between Zuckerberg and other top Meta executives, painted a picture of an executive who was paranoid about his rivals and willing to buy competitors whenever possible.\r\nThe FTC is seeking to force Meta to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that the two acquisitions have given Meta an illegal monopoly over parts of the social networking industry. Emails and documents presented at trial show that Meta, then called Facebook Inc., struggled to compete in the mobile app boom in the early 2010s, buying up successful competitors. The FTC said Meta bought the companies to eliminate direct competitive threats.\r\nMultiple Competitors\r\nZuckerberg and Meta’s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Meta faces a wide array of competitors that fight for user attention, including ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, Google’s YouTube, Apple Inc.’s iMessage and Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that TikTok, in particular, posed a “highly urgent” competitive threat when it sprang up in 2018.\r\n“We observed that our growth slowed down dramatically,” as TikTok gained popularity, Zuckerberg said Wednesday. “It was highly urgent, this has been a top priority for the company for several years.” Meta eventually rolled out a direct competitor, called Reels, that now drives a significant amount of video traffic for the company.\r\nZuckerberg was at times vague over his three days in court, and regularly disputed the FTC’s interpretations of his prior emails. As a leader, the way he communicated with staff was often blunt or harsh, and he spent time on the stand trying to add more nuance to what was written by his younger self. He occasionally clashed with the FTC’s lead lawyer, Daniel Matheson, who objected at one point that Zuckerberg wasn’t answering his questions."

(NYSE:NKE) stands against other best golf stocks to buy according to analysts.\r\nGolf stocks are publicly traded firms that are part of the golf industry. These companies include businesses that manufacture golf equipment, operate golf courses, and provide associated services, giving investors a chance to engage in the golf market.\r\nThe golf industry continues to evolve with women, social play, lessons, and online bookings driving key developments. According to a report by NBC Sports Next, female engagement has grown by 15%, with 800,000 more women golfers joining between 2020 and 2022, compared to a 2% rise among male golfers. Women now account for one-third of junior players and 49% of surveyed golfers. Golf remains a strongly social activity, with 49% of surveyed golfers primarily playing with friends. Business-related golf is also growing, notably among GolfNow users. While 36% of golfers took a lesson in the previous year, the number rose to 67% among GolfNow customers, with many preferring a combination of on-course and facility-based training. Moreover, younger golfers are frequently booking online, with 43% of those aged 18 to 34 reserving at least one round by 2023. Speed and convenience are essential, with 55% citing online booking as the quickest option. These developments point out expansion prospects for courses that cater to women, social golfers, and digitally aware players.\r\nAccording to the National Golf Foundation’s research, the golf business in the United States is still expanding rapidly, with 45 million Americans (aged 6 and up) playing golf in 2023, including 26.6 million on-course and 18.4 million in off-course venues like simulators and Topgolf. The business has seen nearly 2 million new golfers each year for the past ten years, with 3.4 million first-time players projected in 2023 alone. The largest consumer age group is still young adults (18-34 years old), with 6.3 million participants on the course and 5.8 million off. Since 2019, juniors (3.5 million) have shot up by 40%, with girls accounting for 37%. Female involvement has climbed to 7 million, making up 26% of on-course golfers. In 2023, rounds played reached a record high of 531 million, beating the pre-pandemic average by more than 10%. The US offers 16,000 courses at 14,000 facilities, with 75% open to the public. Despite a 12% drop in course supply since 2006, demand remains high, with 22.4 million people expressing a desire to play."

Growth-focused sectors like technology andconsumer discretionaryare particularly vulnerable given their cyclicality and global exposure.\r\nApple(AAPL-3.82%)andNike(NKE-2.14%)are down over 20% year to date at the time of this writing, significantly underperforming theS&P 500andNasdaq Composite, which are also down significantly. Here's why both stocks are selling off and whether they are worth buying now.\r\nImage source: Getty Images.\r\nThere's no sugarcoating Apple's exposure to tariffs, especially in China. China is a key market for Apple -- both from a manufacturing and a sales perspective.\r\nAfter Apple stock surged on April 9 in response to a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs to all countries except China, it sank 4% the following day on news that the tariff rate on Chinese goods would be raised to astaggering 145%. If it sticks, that steep of a tariff rate would crush Apple's near-term profitability. That's why the stock is down so much year to date.\r\n\r\n^SPXdata byYCharts\r\nBuying Apple stock now is a belief that two things will happen:\r\nOn April 10, reports indicated that Apple was flying iPhones from India to the U.S. to circumnavigate tariffs on China. If Apple feels China could be a longer-term risk, it could work to permanently shift manufacturing out of China toward India and other partners in Southeast Asia. However, investors may want to wait for Apple's upcoming earnings call on May 1 to better understand how the company plans to reduce the tariff impact.\r\n\r\nAs for Apple's pricing power, iPhone growth has slowed in recent years. But the company has made up for some of that slowdown by growing its high-margin services segment and repurchasing stock to grow earnings per share. Entertainment services include Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, Apple Books, and more. Apple also has a growing list of financial services, from Apple Pay to Apple Card and Apple Cash.\r\nApple has yet to make as big a splash in artificial intelligence as some investors may have hoped for, so there are fears that it lacks the pricing power it once had. However, services have enhanced the breadth of the Apple ecosystem.\r\nAll told, Apple stands out as a solid buy if you believe in its ability to navigate supply chain challenges and its pricing power. But it's also reasonable to take a wait-and-see approach until investors get more clarity on Apple's response to tariffs from the earnings call in a few weeks.\r\nNike's year-to-date losses are even more alarming, considering it was already one of the worst-performing components of theDow Jones Industrial Averagelast year. Nike has sold off so much that it is now hovering around its lowest level in a decade.\r\nThe abridged version of Nike's problems is that it overly invested in switching the business away from wholesale partnerships to digital, which worked during the pandemic but proved a costly error in recent years, as thedirect-to-consumer segment has been underperforming wholesaleand Nike's brick-and-mortar stores. In addition to management blunders, Nike has been hit hard by formidable competition fromAdidasand newer players likeOn HoldingandDeckers Outdoor-owned Hoka.\r\nTariffs throw yet another wrench in the Nike investment thesis at a time when the company was already licking its wounds from past mistakes. Reports indicate that Nike makes95% of its shoes in China, Vietnam, and Indonesia.China is a key market for Nike's sales as well.\r\nFor the nine months ended Feb. 28, Greater China sales were $5.11 billion compared to $14.87 billion in North America and $9.26 billion in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. During that period, Nike sold more footwear, apparel, and equipment in Greater China than the rest of Asia Pacific and Latin America combined -- with Greater China making up a significant 15.1% of total Nike Brand revenue during that nine-month period.\r\nLike Apple, buying Nike stock now is a bet on the power of its brand, that it can turn the business around, handle competition, and pivot its supply chain. However, Nike is arguably more vulnerable than Apple, considering the business was already in the middle of aturnaroundbefore the onset of trade tensions.\r\nNike has gone from a growth stock to a dividend-paying value stock. Despite its struggles, the company has continued to buy back stock and has23 consecutive years of dividend raises. The sell-off in the stock price has pushed Nike's yield up to a 10-year high of 2.8% and itsprice-to-earnings ratiodown to a 10-year low of just 18. Although if tariffs stick around, Nike's earnings will almost certainly fall in the near term -- making its valuation less appealing.\r\nApple and Nike may operate in entirely different industries, but the buy case for both companies is similar. Both face serious tariff risks, and neither company has been growing earnings at breakneck rates in recent years. However, these are two top brands whose valuations could look cheap in hindsight if they can endure this challenging period.\r\nApple stands out as the safer all-around play, whereas Nike has a higher risk and potential reward if it can turn the business around and navigate tariffs. Both stocks could be worth buying now if you have a long-term horizon. However, it's also reasonable to keep both stocks on a watch list and wait for upcoming earnings calls for more clarity on their strategies, given we are sailing through uncharted waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inApple, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andApplewasn’t one of them.

      "body": "We recently published a list of10 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.\r\nThe market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump’s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year.\r\nThe year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios.\r\nIn the second month of 2025, the US government’s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States’ tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services.\r\nDW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods & services in the latest round of “Trump Tariffs”. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering “continuous stagflation”, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment.\r\nThis scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children’s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children’s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President & CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing:"

      "body": "Nike (NYSE:NKE) recently announced an innovative collaboration with Kool-Aid, unveiling the vibrant Nike x Kool-Aid Ja 2 sneaker, which incorporates playful design elements inspired by NBA star Ja Morant's favorite flavors. Despite this launch, Nike's share price dipped 2.2% over the past week, a movement contrasting with the broader market’s 5.8% gain. This slight decline in Nike's price might not align with the broader market trend influenced by external factors, such as overall market optimism from major tech stocks rallying on tariff exemption news, which appeared to influence broader market sentiment more positively.\r\nBuy, Hold or Sell NIKE? View our complete analysis and fair value estimate and you decide.\r\nFind companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value.\r\nThe recent collaboration between Nike and Kool-Aid, featuring the vibrant Nike x Kool-Aid Ja 2 sneaker, may add fresh appeal to Nike's product lineup. This partnership aligns with Nike's strategy to enhance brand storytelling and leverage sports performance dimensions as growth drivers. Although the share price fell 2.2% recently, this may be a short-term fluctuation possibly reflecting external market conditions rather than an immediate impact of the collaboration. Over a longer period of five years, Nike's total shareholder return, which includes share price and dividends, was a decline of 34.31%, underscoring challenges the company has faced in maintaining upward momentum.\r\nCompared to the past year, Nike's performance has lagged behind both the US Market and the broader Luxury industry, which are indicators of the competitive and economic pressures it encounters. Analysts predict a modest revenue growth of around 1.9% annually, alongside a slight increase in profit margins to 9.9% within three years. However, for Nike to meet the consensus price target of US$78.49, the stock would need to see a significant increase from its current trading price of US$53.27, indicating a trading discount of about 33.4% against the target. The Kool-Aid collaboration may help boost revenue and support these forecasts by enhancing brand engagement and driving full-price sales, aiding in net margin improvements and inventory turnover.\r\nEvaluate NIKE's historical performance by accessing our past performance report.\r\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.We provide commentary based on historical data and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your financial situation.

      "body": "(Bloomberg) -- TikTok users in the US are being inundated with videos from Chinese influencers encouraging American buyers to overcome punitive Trump tariffs by buying direct from the “world’s factory” — China.\r\nMost Read from Bloomberg\r\nHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?\r\nThe Secret Formula for Faster Trains\r\nEven Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem\r\nNYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six\r\nLisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City’s Housing Shortage\r\nMostly filmed at Chinese factories purporting to supply top US brands from Lululemon Athletica Inc. to Nike Inc., the influencers aim to “expose” how the vast majority of consumer goods are made in the world’s second-largest economy. Many of them provide website URLs and contact details for viewers to order directly from these suppliers. “Why don’t you just contact us and buy from us? You won’t believe the prices we give you,” said one creator selling luxury handbags.\r\nIn another video, TikTok creator @LunaSourcingChina, stands outside a factory she says makes Lululemon yoga leggings for $5 to $6 even though they retail in the US for more than $100. “The material and craftsmanship are basically the same,” she says.\r\nA Lululemon spokesperson said the company manufactures about 3% of its finished goods in Mainland China and that authentic products are only available for purchase at Lululemon stores, official websites and authorized partners.\r\nSome of the most popular videos – many uploaded in March but only gaining traction in recent days – have been amplified by a video titled “China exposed the truth” with 8.3 million views and 492,000 likes, as of Monday morning, New York time. The one that reveals the Chinese supplier to Lululemon garnered 2.6 million views and over 215,000 likes, while a “How we bypass tariffs” clip had close to 1 million views and 118,000 likes.\r\n“This campaign appears to be a calculated attempt to undermine President Trump’s tariff policy on China by leveraging TikTok to promote Chinese manufacturing as cheaper, more desirable, and accessible—even in defiance of trade restrictions,” said Alex Goldenberg, senior advisor at the Network Contagion Research Institute at Rutgers University.\r\nWhile it’s unclear how ordering directly from Chinese suppliers would allow consumers to sidestep the tariff — the duty waiver for small parcels that are sent to American homes is also being scrapped from May 2 — the videos are aimed at undermining the White House narrative that the economic measures are in Americans’ interest.\r\nThe levy on Chinese exports is now 145%, while Trump has paused additional tariffs on other countries for 90 days."

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades:\r\nUBS upgradedHubSpot(HUBS)to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $675, down from $775. The firm cites valuation for the upgrade with the shares down 35% since mid-February\r\nBarclays upgradedAutoliv(ALV)to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $97, down from $110. With the firm's recommendations shifting to a more defensive positioning, it believes Autoliv can relatively outperform the sector.\r\nHSBC upgradedKKR(KKR)to Buy from Hold with a price target of $119, down from $170. The firm says that despite heightened macro uncertainty, it sees opportunities.\r\nNeedham upgradedNeurocrine(NBIX)to Buy from Hold with a $138 price target. The firm cites its positive physician survey on Crenessity's ramp in congenital adrenal hyperplasia for the upgrade.\r\nBofA upgradedDuPont(DD)to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $75, down from $88. While the firm does see earnings risks to DuPont from trade disruptions, it views the near 30% pullback in the shares in the last two months as excessive. BofA also upgraded Westlake(WLK)to Buy from Neutral.\r\nTop 5 Downgrades:\r\nBarclays downgradedGeneral Motors(GM)to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $40, down from $70. The downgrade of GM reflects the company's \"significant risk\" to near-term earnings from tariffs.\r\nBofA downgradedPepsiCo(PEP)to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $155, down from $185. Frito-Lay North America's growth is likely to remain below long-term trendline this year and while international segments are scaling and making large contributions to sales and profit growth, it's not enough at this point to make up for slower growth at the North American snacks segment, the firm tells investors.\r\nBarclays downgradedMobileye(MBLY)to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $14, down from $22. The downgrade of Mobileye reflects its thesis that auto tech is at risk of a slower uptake.\r\nBaird downgradedUniversal Health(UHS)to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $224, down from $274. The firm sees minimal incremental buyers of stocks in the managed care and healthcare facilities group until the policy overhang clears. Baird also downgraded Tenet Healthcare(THC), Molina Healthcare(MOH), Elevance Health(ELV)and HCA Healthcare(HCA)to Neutral from Outperform.\r\nWells Fargo downgradedHowmet Aerospace(HWM)to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $118, down from $132. The firm cut estimates across the aerospace group, as it thinks a global economic slowdown hits both original equipment makers and the aftermarket. Wells also downgraded Hexcel(HXL)to Equal Weight from Overweight."

      "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene sold US Treasuries and bought stakes in Amazon.com Inc., Blackstone Inc. and Tesla Inc. the day before President Donald Trump put a 90-day pause on retaliatory tariffs and prompted a market rally.\r\nMost Read from Bloomberg\r\nHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?\r\nTrump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space\r\nEven Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem\r\nLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs\r\n$15 Million Fund Bets Leadership Training Can Improve Chicago Policing\r\nGreene, the Georgia Republican who’s a close ally of Trump, revealed the transactions in a financial disclosure last week.\r\nGreene’s trades were executed over two days, April 8 and 9. On the morning of the 9th, Trump posted on social media that it was a “great time to buy.” About four hours later, he announced he was suspending tariffs, propelling the S&P 500 index to a 9.5% gain, its biggest rally since 2008.\r\nGreene’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\r\nGreene, one of the first lawmakers to file a disclosure since Trump announced his tariffs, is an active trader in stocks, filing eight disclosures so far this year. She’s been particularly bullish on the semiconductor and tech industries. Her sale of Treasuries, though, was the first time she’s sold after buying more than $500,000 of the government-backed securities since the beginning of 2025.\r\nCongressional Democrats have urged investigations into whether people connected to Trump profited from the timing of the tariff announcements.\r\nIn a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she did not know which officials may have had advance knowledge, but called it “unconscionable” that insiders may have profited from the market volatility.\r\nThe disclosure reports only require members to list values of transactions in broad ranges, and do not contain specific times of execution or cost basis, so it’s unclear precisely how many of Greene’s trades happened before Trump broke the news of the tariff pause.\r\nBut at least $11,011 to $165,000 in purchases came on April 8. As of 11:20 a.m. Tuesday in New York, shares of Blackstone, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Tesla traded higher than at any point on that day.\r\nOver the two days, her stock purchases totaled $21,021 to $315,000. She sold $50,001 to $100,000 of US Treasuries on April 8.\r\nAmong the other names in Greene’s purchases were chipmakers Nvidia Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., along with apparel companies Lululemon Athletica Inc. and Nike Inc."

The global sportswear icon has been leading the industry for decades. It's a well-known consumer brand that has a presence virtually all over the world. People have recognized the business as having strength in product innovation and marketing.\r\nBut these strengths haven't prevented theconsumer discretionary stockfrom tanking. As of this writing (April 12), it trades 69% below its record high. Nike's winning culture has been replaced by a losing track record due to ongoing challenges.\r\nIt's still hard to ignore the current dip, which might present a rare buying opportunity. If you're taking a closer look at Nike stock, know that adding the company to your portfolio is only a brilliant move if you believe one thing.\r\nInvestors seem to be avoiding Nike shares. This is clearly evident by looking at the valuation. They sell at aprice-to-earnings(P/E) ratio of 18.1, which is basically their cheapest level in 10 years. Value investors are paying attention.\r\nThe stock's disappointing performance is warranted. Nike's revenue is declining. It generated $11.3 billion in sales in the third quarter of 2025 (ended Feb. 28), down 9% year over year. The leadership team expects a mid-teens percentage drop in the current fiscal quarter. This is happening at the same time that Nike's competitors continue to grow their top lines.\r\nUncharacteristically, Nike has struggled to release fresh new products to keep customers excited. And it prioritized digital sales at the expense of its third-party retailing partners.\r\nTariffs aren't helpingthis situation, either. Nike produces nearly all of its shoes in Vietnam, China, and Indonesia, countries that have high levies placed on products coming from them. We don't know how things will ultimately play out. However, Nike's margins could take a hit, or its customers could see higher prices. Neither of these scenarios will boost investor confidence.\r\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is818%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\r\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now…\r\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\r\nBuying Nike stock is a brilliant move, in the face of current headwinds, only if you thinkearnings per share(EPS) will be higher in the next five years. This requires, first and foremost, for revenue to start growing again. The leadership team mentioned that things should stabilize after Q4 2025.\r\nNonetheless, it's extremely difficult to predict when EPS will bottom out. Getting to mid-single-digit revenue gains and improving profitability will help.\r\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates expect EPS to rise at a compound annual rate of 15% between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2027. The best-case scenario is for the double-digit gains to continue after this forecast period. The idea is that the stock price should mimic the trajectory of bottom-line performance. It will require a lot of patience from investors.\r\nNike deserves credit. It's the leader in the global market for sportswear. It has one of the mostpowerful brandson the face of the planet. Its worldwide presence gives it unmatched visibility. And while its challenges are hard to ignore, the business generated $48 billion in revenue in the past 12 months. Nike isn't going away anytime soon.\r\nLow expectations (from the cheap P/E ratio) mixed with higher EPS five years from now can result in a fantastic outcome for investors. The question of buying the stock ultimately comes down to whether you believe management can successfully execute a turnaround by highlighting the brand in the eyes of consumers, releasing exciting new products, and making sure it's striking the right balance between wholesale and direct distribution channels.\r\nThe risk is high. But so is the potential reward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inNike, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andNikewasn’t one of them.

      "body": "We recently published a list of19 Mid- And Large-Cap Stocks Insiders Are Buying After Trump’s Tariff Rollout. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against other mid- and large-cap stocks insiders are buying after Trump’s tariff rollout.\r\nOn April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump declared “Liberation Day” and signed Executive Order 14257, imposing a baseline 10% tariff on nearly all U.S. imports, effective April 5. Higher tariffs—ranging from 11% to 50%—were scheduled for 57 countries and territories, including the European Union, China, and Japan. These increased rates were set to begin April 9 but were postponed for 90 days, with the exception of China, which continued to face elevated tariffs.\r\nIn April, some insiders took advantage of the dip to buy shares, while others chose to sell. Analyzing insider trading can provide valuable insights: purchases often signal confidence in the company’s future, while sales may reflect personal or diversification choices. Therefore, insider trading should be evaluated in the context of the company’s financial health and overall market conditions.\r\nToday, we’re focusing on stocks that insiders are buying in April. Using Insider Monkey’s insider trading screener, we identified 19 mid- and large-cap companies where at least one insider bought shares between April 2 and April 14. From this list, we ranked the top 19 stocks based on the highest value of insider purchases during this period.\r\nOur research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds, focusing on insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\r\nA team of trainers and athletes displaying a wide range of athletic and casual footwear.\r\nMarket Cap: $81.79 billion\r\nNIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a globally recognized and popular brand that designs, markets, and sells athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment under names like NIKE, Converse, and Jumpman. Its products are sold through retail stores, digital platforms, and independent distributors around the world. It is also one of the10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.\r\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Nike (NYSE:NKE) reported $11.3 billion in revenue, a 9% decline from the previous year. Gross margin also fell by 330 basis points, reaching 41.5%. Wholesale revenues were $6.2 billion, down 7% on a reported basis and down 4% on a currency-neutral basis year-over-year. Net income was $800 million, down 32%, and diluted earnings per share was $0.54, a decrease of 30%."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\r\nOn Friday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer outlined what investors should focus on in the week, especially pointing to earnings reports from major banks.\r\n�Rumor, innuendo, intrigue these are the stuff of great novels, of fabulous miniseries, riveting plays, and now they�re the stuff of the stock market.�\r\nREAD ALSO:Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocksand10 Stocks on Jim Cramer�s Radar Recently.\r\nHe noted the chaotic nature of the current environment and remarked that �this tape has it all,� and emphasized how unpredictable developments from the White House have added to the turbulence. Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes.\r\n�Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,� he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, �Except this isn�t an eight-part blockbuster, it�s our money.� Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday�s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic.\r\nCramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a �liberation day bottom,� a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, �Not sure, I�m just not sure.� He added:\r\n�Have you ever noticed the weekends don�t provide relaxation anymore because the president�s got advisors? He�s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He�s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime�. Monday�s trading, well, let�s just say that it looks like that it�s earning season so it�s gonna be even harder than usual.�\r\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey�s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\r\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

      "body": "A series of President Donald Trump�s ambiguous tariffs on several other countries, including China, wreaked havoc on Wall Street, and semiconductor stocks suffered the consequences. However, the latest tariff exemptions on chips and other high-tech goods boosted the equity market, leading to a recovery in many previously declining semiconductor stocks.\r\nTherefore, this is an ideal time to invest in strong semiconductor stocks, such asASML Holding N.V.ASML andNVIDIA CorporationNVDA, which are currently trading at a discount following a recent drop but are poised to benefit from the upcoming rebound.\r\nOf course, the tariff reliefs are temporary, and these semiconductor stocks may experience bouts of volatility if trade disputes remain unresolved within the specified time frame. However, these stocks have a wide moat, providing them a competitive advantage and immunity to market fluctuations. Let�s examine this in detail �\r\nDutch company ASML is the global leader in producing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which are essential for manufacturing powerful artificial intelligence (AI) chips. The lithography equipment is pricey, so the company doesn�t need to sell many to make sufficient revenues.\r\nAlthough the company sold only 44 EUV systems last year, they accounted for 38% of its total net system sales of 21.8 billion euros. It sells to major chipmakers likeIntel CorporationINTC andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedTSM.\r\nHaving a monopoly in EUV lithography systems could potentially lead to market share loss, with China developing similar systems. However, manufacturing these systems is time-consuming due to their complex nature. Thus, the current risk of losing the monopoly is minimal, allowing the company to sustain long-term growth for stakeholders.\r\nSimilarly, Jensen Huang-led NVIDIA enjoys a more than 80% share in the growing discrete graphic processing units (GPUs) market, giving the company a competitive edge over its rivals and fueling long-term growth. The company�s CUDA software platform is gaining popularity globally among developers, while the demand for Blackwell chips has skyrocketed due to their better energy efficiency level and faster AI interface.\r\nFor some time, the rapid growth of AI applications has spurred the demand for advanced memory chips that require ASML�s EUV equipment for their manufacture. ASML�s EUV lithography machines experienced an increase in new orders in the fourth quarter of 2024 and are anticipated to see a surge in first-quarter 2025 bookings as well."

A second card, the GeForce RTX 5060, will follow in May, along with corresponding laptops.\r\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.\r\nAccording to the company's announcement, the RTX 5060 family introduces DLSS 4's Multi Frame Generation, which uses artificial intelligence to generate up to three extra frames for every traditionally rendered frame. The result, Nvidia said, is up to an eightfold increase in frame rates compared to traditional rendering.\r\nNvidia said the transformer AI model powering DLSS 4 is trained on high-resolution gameplay, improving both image clarity and performance. It also supports features like DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Ray Reconstruction. These technologies are already integrated into more than 100 games and applications.\r\nThe new cards are aimed at users upgrading from older 60 and 50 class models. Nvidia said there are over 50 million users of these previous-generation cards, and the RTX 5060 family offers a significant performance leap. In titles such asHogwarts Legacy, the company said the RTX 5060 Ti achieves twice the frame rate of the RTX 4060 Ti at 1440p settings, with reduced latency and smoother gameplay.\r\nThe RTX 5060 desktop cards come in 8GB and 16GB variants and will be available through partners including ASUS, GIGABYTE, MSI, and ZOTAC. Laptops equipped with the RTX 5060 will launch in May from major manufacturers and offer similar improvements in performance and power efficiency, according to Nvidia.\r\nThe cards feature new Tensor Cores, Shader Cores, Ray Tracing Cores, and GDDR7 VRAM. Nvidia also said users can expect faster video encoding and support for DisplayPort 2.1.\r\nThe rollout marks Nvidia's continued effort to integrate neural rendering and real-time AI-powered graphics into mainstream gaming hardware. The company said its Reflex latency-reduction technology is now supported in more than 130 titles, including popular esports games likeValorant.\r\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

      "title": "Nvidia faces $5.5 billion charge as US restricts chip sales to China",
      "body": "By Stephen Nellis and Karen Freifeld\r\n(Reuters) - Nvidia on Tuesday said it would take $5.5 billion in charges after the U.S. government limited exports of its H20 artificial intelligence chip to China, a key market for one of its most popular chips.\r\nNvidia's AI chips have been a key focus of U.S. export controls as U.S. officials have moved to keep the most advanced chips from being sold to China as the U.S. tries to keep ahead in the AI race. After those controls were implemented, Nvidia began designing chips that would come as close as possible to U.S. limits.\r\nNvidia shares were down about 6% in after-hours trading.\r\nA U.S. Commerce Department spokesperson said late on Tuesday that it was issuing new licensing requirements for exports of chips including Nvidia's H20, AMD's MI308 and their equivalents.\r\n\"The Commerce Department is committed to acting on the President's directive to safeguard our national and economic security,\" said the spokesperson of the department that oversees U.S. export controls.\r\nAMD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its shares were down 7% in after-hours trading.\r\nFor Nvidia, the H20 is its most advanced chip available for sale in China and is central to its efforts to stay engaged with China's booming AI industry. Chinese companies including Tencent, Alibaba and TikTok parent ByteDance had been ramping up orders for H20 chips due to booming demand for low-cost AI models from startup DeepSeek, Reuters reported in February.\r\nWhile the H20 chip is not as fast at training AI models as Nvidia's chips for sale outside China, it is competitive with some of those chips at a step known as inference, where AI models serve up answers to users. Inference is fast becoming the biggest part of the AI chip market. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month argued that Nvidia is well positioned to dominate that shift.\r\nBut Nvidia said on Tuesday that the U.S. government was restricting H20 sales to China because of the risk the chips could be used in a supercomputer. While the H20 has lower computing capabilities than other Nvidia chips, its ability to connect to memory chips and other computing chips at high speeds is still high.\r\nThose memory and connectivity aspects could make the H20 useful in building supercomputers in China, and the U.S. has placed restrictions on selling chips for use in supercomputers in China since 2022. The Institute for Progress, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday argued for restricting H20 chips, writing that Chinese firms were likely already building such systems."

      "body": "Investing.com -- AI powerhouse NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) disclosed on Tuesday that it anticipates up to $5.5 billion in charges in its upcoming first-quarter financial results related to U.S. chip export controls on China, sending its shares down sharply in aftermarket trade.\r\nThe announcement follows the U.S. government�s decision to mandate licenses for exports of the H20 chip to China, including Hong Kong and Macau, as well as to D:5 countries or companies with ultimate parent companies in those regions.\r\nShares of NVIDIA fell 6% to $105.42 in after-hours trading following the news. Those of peers such as AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) sank between 2% and 7%, while major Nvidia supplier TSMC (NYSE:TSM) shed 2.4%.\r\nThe disclosure from NVIDIA comes just one day after the company made headlines after announcing a $500 billion investment to produce AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S.\r\nThe U.S. government communicated to NVIDIA on April 9, 2025, that a license would be required for exporting the H20 integrated circuits, as well as any other circuits with similar memory and interconnect bandwidth capabilities. On April 14, 2025, it was further clarified that this licensing requirement would remain in place indefinitely.\r\nThe measure is intended to prevent the potential use of Nvidia�s products in Chinese supercomputers or military applications. Nvidia said the $5.5 billion charge is related to inventory, purchase commitments, and associated reserves for its H20 microchip products.\r\n\"The financial impact is small relatively, but the strategic blow is the focus of the market as Nvidia now has massive blockades going after the China market in the middle of this raging US/China tariff battle,\" Wedbush analysts wrote in a note.\r\n\"Nvidia is a key strategic asset for the US and the Trump Administration during this very tense period with China...and the White House is going to make sure Jensen and Nvidia�s chips do not land in China for now and help Beijing in the AI Revolution.\"\r\nThe H20 chip is the main AI chip Nvidia is permitted to sell in China under export restrictions imposed by the Biden administration, as it sought to close off Beijing�s access to cutting-edge advancements in AI tech.\r\nStill, earlier media reports showed Nvidia clocked strong demand for its H20 chips in China, as Chinese AI development and investment ramped up following the release of DeepSeek earlier this year.\r\nThe Information reported earlier in April that Chinese firms including ByteDance,AlibabaGroup (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) had ordered at least $16 billion worth of H20 chips in the first three months of 2025."

Payments-focused XRP followed a similar trajectory, falling over 2% to $2.08, while Cardano's ADA token slipped 4% to $0.61. TheCoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, weakened over 2%.\r\nMeanwhile, coins supposedly associated with artificial intelligence (AI) continued to fare worse as shares in NVDA tanked 8% to $89.10 after thecompany disclosedin a regulatory filing that it expects to write down $5.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter due to the new restrictions on exports of its H20 chip to China.\r\nThe news came a day afterunusual activity in NVDA put optionspointing to an impending market swoon.\r\nThe futures tied to the Nasdaq index fell over 1% as well, offering negative cues to risk assets in general.\r\nThe next catalyst awaiting release Wednesday morning Eastern time is the U.S. retail sales report for March. Per economists polled by Dow Jones, the data is expected to show a 1.2% increase in consumer spending on the month, up from a 0.2% climb in February.\r\nA better-than-expected report will likely help assuage recession fears triggered by President Donald Trump's trade war with China and other trading partners. However, there is a risk that markets will dismiss it as backward-looking, failing to account for the major escalation in trade tensions seen this month.\r\nFederal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell is alsoscheduled to speakon Wednesday at the Economic Club of Chicago on his outlook for the U.S. economy.\r\n\"All eyes are on Powell. Markets are holding their breath for Powell on Wednesday. Between the trade war and rising recession chatter, traders are watching for any hint the Fed might be forced to cut sooner than expected,\" Secure Digital Markets said in Tuesday's research note.\r\nThe forward-looking market-based measures like the inflation breakevens have dropped amid trade tensions, pointing to the disinflationary impact of Trump's tariffs. That could provide the Fed with a leeway to cut rates.\r\nEarly this week, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Wallersaidthe bank would be forced to quickly make a series of \"bad news\" rate cuts if the U.S. president reimposes the levies unveiled on April 2.

Traders are wondering if he will echo the surprisingly dovish tone set by his colleague Fed Governor Christopher Waller, or stay more balanced.\r\nOvernight, Washington issued new export licensing requirements for Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 artificial intelligence chips to China. Nvidia's shares slumped 6% in after-hours trading, after it said the move would cost $5.5 billion.\r\n\"This disclosure is a clear sign that Nvidia now has massive restrictions and hurdles in selling to China,\" said Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities.\r\n\"The Street will take this news with clear nervousness worried these are the first shots fired in the tech battle between the US and China and Beijing/Xi are not just going to take this news and walk away.\"\r\nSeparately, President Donald Trump ordered a probe into potential new tariffs on all U.S. critical minerals imports, on top of reviews into pharmaceutical and chip imports. Beijing is continuing to play hardball, having reportedly ordered airlines to suspend deliveries of Boeing aircraft.\r\nThe sell-off in Asian stocks gathered pace in the afternoon. S&P 500 futures fell 1.5% while Nasdaq futures slumped 2.3%.\r\nThe gloom is set to spread to Europe, with EURO STOXX 50 futures pointing to a 1.5% drop at the open.\r\nOn Wednesday, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.4%, snapping a four-day winning streak. Japan's Nikkei dropped 1.6%.\r\nChinese blue chips fell 0.7% as investors failed to find much solace in some solid GDP data that predated the tariff increases in April. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slumped 2.7%.\r\n\"Both countries seem to believe they have the upper hand, potentially prolonging the current stalemate for months to come,\" said analysts at PGIM Fixed Income in a note to clients.\r\n\"China appears to have no intention of climbing down from its current stance on tariffs and instead views the current trade dynamics as an opportunity to make inroads with countries that export to the U.S.\"\r\nThe White House said Trump is open to making a trade deal with China but Beijing should make the first move.\r\nGOLD SHINES\r\nAll of the uncertainties left gold in an unstoppable position, with the bullion up 2% to hit another record high of $3,290 per ounce."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks on the move.\r\nMarket uncertainty aside, the AI race is tighter than ever. A report by Stanford University�s Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) states that not only has the battlefield become tighter, but also more crowded than previously. The report notes that Google and OpenAI are neck to neck in the race to build cutting-edge AI, and that other companies are fiercely closing in. Meta, Anthropic, and Elon Musk�s xAI are a few of these names. Chinese competitors are also closing in on the AI race. In particular, DeepSeek�s R1 model is very close to the top-performing models of two of the leading AI companies.\r\n�It creates an exciting space. It�s good that these models are not all developed by five guys in Silicon Valley. Chinese models are catching up as far as performance to the US models..but across the globe, there are new players emerging in the space.�\r\nIn recent news, OpenAI has launched its new AI model GPT-4.1, along with smaller versions GPT-4.1 mini and GPT-4.1 nano. These models boast major improvements in coding, instruction following, and long context comprehension.\r\nREAD NOW:10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid Market Volatilityand14 AI Stocks Catching Wall Street�s Attention\r\nAccording to OpenAI, the models outperform the company�s most advanced GPT-4o model across the board and are available only on OpenAI�s application programming interface (API). In particular, the GPT-4.1 brags a 21% improvement over GPT-4o and 27% over GPT-4.5 on coding. Moreover, there are improvements in instruction following and long context comprehension, which make these models a better choice for powering AI agents.\r\n�Benchmarks are strong, but we focused on real-world utility, and developers seem very happy.�\r\nOpenAI also noted that these models operate at a �much lower cost� compared to GPT-4.5, and that the company would turn off the GPT-4.5 preview that is available in the API in July because the new models offer �improved or similar performance.�\r\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\r\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Concerns over global oil demand worsened after Beijing swapped its chief trade envoy and said that relying on domestic consumption was insufficient to spur growth. In wider markets, warnings by ASML Holdings NV and Nvidia Corp. on the effects of tariffs weighed on US equity futures.\r\nChina�s downbeat outlook came as Beijing replaced its chief international trade negotiator in a closely watched appointment as traders try to anticipate any possible shifts in China�s stance toward Washington. The shuffle came after President Donald Trump insisted on Tuesday that the ball was in Beijing�s court to start negotiations with Washington.\r\n�While we may have seen a peak in headline tariff rates, the intensifying standoff between the US and China is casting a long shadow over global demand expectations,� said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist for Saxo Markets Pte. �The uncertainty around retaliatory measures and supply chain disruptions is weighing on risk appetite and, in turn, on the oil market.�\r\nCrude remains near the lowest in four years, after a sharp drop earlier this month brought about by an onslaught of tariffs and counter-levies between the US and its biggest trading partners.

ASML later added to investor anxiety by posting orders that missed expectations and saying that it doesn�t know how to quantify the impact of recent tariff announcements.\r\nThe latest developments show how tariffs are already wreaking havoc on global companies, while the trade war is extending beyond mere import taxes as well. The fallout could weigh on chip-sector earnings and also set back China�s ambitions to compete on the global tech stage.\r\nThe H20 restrictions are �driven by concerns over China�s rise in the electronics sector, and in that sense, it is likely to become a permanent policy,� said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management. �It is expected to have a significant negative impact on semiconductor supply chain.�\r\nNvidia warned that it will report around $5.5 billion in related charges during the fiscal first quarter. Its shares slid about 5% in late US trading Tuesday. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 later extended losses to more than 2% after ASML�s report.\r\nAmong key suppliers, Korean memory maker SK Hynix Inc. slumped as much as 3.9% Wednesday. Top foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 2.9%. Japanese chip-equipment maker Advantest Corp. dropped as much as 7.8%, extending its fall after ASML�s statement.\r\nTSMC was already likely to slow some production expansion on a weaker economic outlook, and �the tighter rules on Nvidia�s China sales might amplify the deceleration,� Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Ken Hui wrote in a note.\r\nFor China, the broader restrictions raise concerns that access to global tech hardware will be further choked off. Exports of the most-advanced chips and equipment to the Asian nation are already banned, and the H20 is a scaled-down product specifically designed not to be too powerful.\r\nEven after DeepSeek raised hopes that advances can be made in artificial intelligence and other fields without the most cutting-edge chips, China�s tech giants may suffer if curbs keep getting extended. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. sank as much as 5.4% in Hong Kong trading Wednesday, while Baidu Inc. fell 3.3%."

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\r\nKey Points\r\nSome of Wall Street's most-popular stocks were sent to the chopping block by prominent asset managers prior to the market's wild gyrations.\r\nEvery so often, Wall Street reminds investors that stocks don't move higher in a straight line. Sometimes,these reminders are anything but subtle.\r\nOver the last two weeks, investors have witnessed volatility akin to the COVID-19 crash of February-March 2020, as well as during the height of the financial crisis in 2008. On one end of the spectrum, theDow Jones Industrial Average,S&P 500, andNasdaq Compositeall logged their largest individual point gains on April 9 since their respective inceptions.\r\nConversely, these indexes have endured some of their largest nominal point declines on record followingPresident Donald Trump's April 2nd Liberation Day tariff announcement.\r\nImage source: Getty Images.\r\nAlthough history has shown that outsized volatility tends to create phenomenal buying opportunities for patient investors, some of Wall Street's brightest money managers appear to have seen these warning signs for the stock market well in advance.\r\nIn particular, select billionaire investors sold shares of three incredibly popular but pricey stocks ahead of Wall Street's record-setting bout of volatility.\r\nThe first pricey but cutting-edge stock that billionaires were jettisoning prior to Wall Street's wild vacillations isartificial intelligence (AI)-driven data-mining specialistPalantir Technologies(PLTR6.27%).\r\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont, who oversees close to $29.7 billion in assets at Coatue Management, dumped more than 4.81 million shares of Palantir during the second quarter of 2024. It's a similar story for Duquesne Family Office's billionaire chief Stanley Druckenmiller, who sold more than 728,000 shares of Palantir after March 31, 2024.\r\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor�stotal average return is800%� a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\r\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now�\r\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\r\nOn the surface, Palantir has a lot to offer. Both of its AI-powered software-as-a-service platforms, Gotham and Foundry, are irreplaceable at scale. Additionally, Gotham tends to lock in contracts with federal governments spanning four or five years, while Foundry is a subscription-based model that incents business loyalty. This is to say that on top of Palantir having a sustainable moat, its cash flow tends to be highly predictable.\r\nHowever, there's a degree of near-term growth uncertainty hovering around Palantir at present. President Trump's efforts to rein in federal spending are casting doubt on what the defense budget might look like over the coming four years. Gotham relies heavily on contracts from the U.S. government.\r\nThe Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow forecast is alsocalling for the steepest contraction in organic gross domestic product (GDP)for the U.S. economy (excluding the COVID-19 quarters) since the tail-end of the Great Recession -- a 2.4% decline, based on an April 9 update. This suggests the commercially focused Foundry segment might endure subpar subscription growth in the coming quarters.\r\nBut what's really been a hard pill to swallow is Palantir's valuation. During previous technology and next-big-thing innovation bubbles, leading-edge businesses peaked atprice-to-sales (P/S) ratiosin the neighborhood of 30 to 40. Palantir stock traded at roughly 100 times sales when it hit its all-time closing high less than two months ago. Even after a modest pullback, Palantir is still commanding a P/S ratio of 75, whichis a level that's never been sustainable throughout history.\r\nImage source: Getty Images.\r\nPalantir wasn't the only ultra-popular AI stock that was largely shown the door ahead of Wall Street's historic volatility. Semiconductor kingpinNvidia(NVDA1.30%)is a juggernaut thatfour billionaire money managers sent to the chopping block:\r\nWhat made Nvidia such a popular stock to ownis its near-monopoly share of the graphics processing units (GPUs) that act as the brains in AI-accelerated data centers. Nvidia's Hopper (H100) and next-generation Blackwell GPUs are what power AI solutions, as well as the training of most large language models.\r\nBut the dicey thing about next-big-thing trends is they've allworked their way through an early stage bubble-bursting eventover the last 30-plus years. Dating back to the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, every game-changing innovation has eventually failed to meet investors' lofty expectations. All technologies need time to mature, but investors consistently overestimate early adoption rates and/or utility. If the AI bubble bursts, Nvidia stock would almost certainly be hit hard.\r\nNvidia also faces the threat of growing internal competition. Many of its top customers by net sales are developing AI-GPUs and solutions of their own to use in their data centers. While this hardware isn't a threat to the superior computing speed of Nvidia's AI-GPUs, it is notably cheaper and more accessible. This is a recipe for Nvidia to lose out on valuable data center real estate, and for its gross margin to decline.\r\nThough Nvidia isn't pricey relative to its forward-year earnings, it is still valued at a P/S ratio of 21. While this is down 50% from its P/S ratio of 42 last summer, it's still more than double the P/S ratios of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers.\r\nThe third pricey stock billionaire money managers were sellers of prior to Wall Street's wild volatility isfast-casual restaurant chainChipotle Mexican Grill(CMG-1.42%).\r\nDuring the December-ended quarter, Coatue's Philippe Laffont completely exited his fund's stake in Chipotle by selling nearly 4.6 million shares. Additionally, billionaire Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Managementaxed close to 16.6 million split-adjusted shares throughout 2024. The \"split-adjusted\" aspect takes into account thatChipotle Mexican Grill effected a 50-for-1 forward split in June.\r\nLike the other companies listed here, Chipotle presents with competitive advantages that have made it a popular stock to own. Its use of responsibly raised meats and locally sourced vegetables (when possible) speaks to consumers who prefer organic and natural foods. Plus, using only fresh ingredients and keeping its menu relatively small allows staff to quickly prepare meals and keep the queue moving.\r\nFurthermore, Chipotle's introduction of mobile-dedicated drive-thru lanes (known as \"Chipotlanes\") prior to the pandemic led to an entirely new source of revenue for the company.\r\nBut it's not all peaches and cream, or should I say avocados and beans, for Chipotle.\r\nWhile it's benefited from the willingness of consumers to pay a higher price for organic and natural foods, there comes a point where inflationary pressures begin to weigh on the company's margins and/or its customer base. During the December-ended quarter, the company's comparable restaurant sales growth clocked in at only 5.4%. This is well below its historic average, which potentially signals that inflationary pressures are hitting home.\r\nTo stay consistent with this list,the other prime concern for Chipotle Mexican Grill is its valuation. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33 is aggressive considering half of its sales growth is coming from the opening of new stores. With organic growth from existing stores hovering in the 5% to 7% range, and the scope of innovation somewhat limited for restaurants, a forward P/E of 33 arguably prices Chipotle stock for perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inPalantir Technologies, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now� andPalantir Technologieswasn�t one of them.

      "body": "By Fanny Potkin and Liam Mo\r\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Nvidia did not warn at least some major customers in advance about new U.S. export rules it was told about a week ago requiring it to obtain licenses to sell its China-focused artificial intelligence chip, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\r\nThe U.S. chipmaker disclosed on Tuesday that American officials had informed the company on April 9 that its H20 chip would require an export license for sales to China.\r\nThe move to restrict H20 shipments marks Washington's latest effort to limit China's access to advanced semiconductors, as the United States seeks to maintain its edge in AI technology.\r\nMajor Chinese cloud companies were still anticipating H20 deliveries by year-end, unaware of the impending restrictions, according to the two sources, who said Nvidia's China sales team also did not appear to be informed ahead of the public announcement. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\r\nNvidia declined to comment.\r\nThe export controls threaten Nvidia's business in China, one of its largest markets. Nvidia had secured $18 billion of H20 orders since the start of the year, according to one of the two sources and a third source.\r\nChina generated $17 billion in revenue, or 13% of Nvidia's total sales, in its last fiscal year that ended on January 26.\r\nNvidia shares fell 6% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after it said it would take up to $5.5 billion of charges in the first quarter ending April 27 due to the licensing requirement, which the U.S. government told it on Monday would be indefinite.\r\nThe charges are associated with inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves for H20 products, the company said.\r\nChinese tech giants including Tencent, Alibaba and ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, had increased orders for H20 chips amid surging demand for affordable AI models from companies like startup DeepSeek, Reuters reported in February.\r\nAlibaba, ByteDance and Tencent did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\r\nThe H20 is the primary chip Nvidia is legally permitted to sell in China and was launched after the latest round of U.S. export restrictions took effect in October 2023.\r\nWashington has banned exports of Nvidia's most advanced chips to China since 2022, concerned that advanced technologies could be used by China to build up its military capabilities.\r\nThe restrictions on H20 could benefit Chinese AI chipmakers, particularly Huawei, which offers competing products to Nvidia's lineup, analysts said."

So after the chip maker disclosed that it would take a $5.5 billion dollar hit from the US government's surprise new controls on its semiconductor exports to China. For more on the latest, let's welcome now Daniel Newman, Futurum CEO. Daniel, it is great to see you here on set. Appreciate it from Texas. Um, you know, before J. Powell, frankly, this was the story of the day. It was chips, it was Nvidia. Nvidia is down here, Dan. It's not about 10%. It's getting clobbered in today's trade. I guess two, two questions to start. One, Dan, were you surprised by that news when you saw those headlines? And two, do you think down 10%, is that move justified in your opinion?\r\nYeah, first of all, nobody should have been surprised by this move. Really the administration's been giving the signal that it was going to clamp down. Now, what was interesting is this week, there was a bit of gyration because they cut this deal, they announced 500 billion dollars of AI supercomputers being built here in the United States. And then a day later, he pulls back on this new export licensing requirement.\r\nThat that, you bring that, Dan. That is an interesting point because there were some folks who thought Jensen Wong was going to be kind of shielded from this. Right?\r\nThey made a deal. I had a few reporters actually hit me up, do you think there was some tip for tat going on. And first of all, I think Trump needs to show, President Trump needs to show that there is no tip for tat. So whether it's, you know, Tim Cook bringing more manufacturing here, whether it's TSMC coming here. But I actually think on the other side of this, and maybe we come back to this, is that I actually think creating some certainty with the, with the community, the business community, about what type of benefit they can expect by onshoring and bringing manufacturing back here. I think that would be a great start. Having said that, national security, economic security, and AI are tightly correlated. Us giving the chips to China, whether it's the tuned down chips or the best chips coming through intermediaries, which they shouldn't be getting. This is something that's giving an advantaging China. There's a lot of people out there that are like, oh, well, this is going to only push their resolve. Do you think China is waiting because we're sending Nvidia chips, they're not investing in Huawei and building their own chips? You can be absolutely certain that they are. This war, this trade war, is largely being fought on the grounds of long-term economic domination. Long-term economic domination will only be had if we control the technology trade. Nvidia is at the forefront of that trade.\r\nAnd what do you think of from an investor standpoint? Here you have Nvidia falling yet again, 8 to 10%. You know, look what happened over the last couple days. It had recovered from its lows, right? And a lot of investors who got in short term experienced that bounce. Where, where do you think that looks like this week?\r\nYeah. I, I look at that line of people around the corner at $150 that just couldn't wait to buy. And you go, what is really changed? Well, first of all, you've got GPUs melting over at, at X and at OpenAI. There's so much demand there. Could Nvidia pivot some of its capacity, not focus so much on building specialized products for China, and make sure we meet all the capacity and demand that's out there for companies that are in the US that are trying to build? You've got $325 billion of CAPEX. And it's been reiterated. So whether it's been Sunder Pichai, whether it's been Satya Nadella, they're all planning to spend. And I genuinely believe, Sylvia, that the companies with, you know, the big operating leverage are going to look at this pullback as the moment to build AI infrastructure out. Because when we come out of this, and we will come out of this, there will be deals made. Calling that on the record right now. It may be a tough couple of months. When deals are made, we will see the economy accelerate. And those companies want to build the future and have that AI infrastructure in place. So the Googles and the Microsofts and the Amazons, they're going to buy Nvidia. Um, and one other thing, if I, if I may, I find it very interesting that everybody thinks that China and their push to build Huawei is going to be so successful. When AMD came out with a competitive product, no one believed they could build the software. Broadcom's making chips for the hyperscalers and everyone said, well, that's great, but they don't have CUDA. So it's not going to work as well. But suddenly, everybody believes that China and Huawei is going to build the CUDA competitive product that's going to undo Nvidia? I believe in China, I believe in their resolve. I don't believe that they have as much competition or much competitive capability today as people are suggesting."

The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 3.1%, the S&P 500 lost 2.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 700 points, or 1.7%. Losses rippled across sectors, dragging the Russell 2000 down 1.4%.\r\nNvidia stockplunged 6.9%after the company disclosed a $5.5 billion charge linked to fresh U.S. export restrictions on its H20 AI chips — once seen as a workaround for earlier bans. AMD (AMD) stock fell 7.4%, while chip equipment giant ASML dropped 7% after it missed first-quarter revenue estimates and warned that escalating tariffs could cloud the global outlook through 2026.\r\nMarkets retreated further as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that President Donald Trump’s tariffs were“highly likely” to fuel inflation, and suggested the central bank will wait to gaugetheir effect before lowering interest rates.\r\n“Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,” Powell said during a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago. “The inflationary effects could also be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.”\r\n“For the time being,” Powell said, “we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.”\r\nStill, there were bright spots. Abbott Labs (ABT) beat earnings expectations with adjusted EPS of $1.09 and double-digit organic growth in its medical device division, including a 20% jump in diabetes-related products. Prologis (PLD), the world’s largest industrial REIT, met forecasts with $1.27 in core FFO and reaffirmed guidance — but noted rising customer caution.\r\nMeanwhile,U.S. retail sales surged1.4% in March, the biggest monthly gain since January 2023. Analysts said shoppers likely pulled purchases forward to avoid tariff-driven price hikes: Think customers loading up on TVs and T-shirts at Costco (COST) ahead of potential price pain.\r\nThe CNN (WBD) Fear & Greed Index remains in “extreme fear” territory — a mood that’s proven hard to shake sinceTrump’s tariff barrageearlier this month. It should come as no surprise: This is a market increasingly driven by policy whiplash, cheerleading soundbites, and dropped hints of trade negotiations. Mixed signals, selective leaks, andsudden reversals— often via social media or offhand remarks — are proving as influential as official announcements."

      "body": "The U.S.-China tech war just claimed another high-profile casualty.\r\nNvidia (NVDA), America’s third-largest company by market cap, said Wednesday it will take a $5.5 billion charge after the U.S. government moved to block exports of its H20 AI chips to China — citing national security risks tied to their potential use.\r\nThe H20 had been engineered to comply with earlier Biden-era restrictions and had become a key product for Nvidia in China, one that was quickly gaining traction. But the sudden reversal by the Trump administration, after months of policy limbo and back-channel talks, signals another hard turn in trade policy — and lays bare the high-stakes game playing out among Silicon Valley, Washington, and Beijing.\r\nLet’s rewind: On April 9, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huangattendeda $1-million-a-plate Mar-a-Lago dinner with President Trump, where AI exports were reportedly a topic of conversation. Proceeds from the dinner went to MAGA Inc., a Trump-aligned super PAC that can raise unlimited funds but isn’t allowed to coordinate directly with the campaign. Five days later, on April 14, the U.S. informed Nvidia it would need a license to export H20 chips abroad. On April 16, Nvidia announced the multibillion-dollar charge — and markets flinched.\r\nMeanwhile, ASML (ASML), the Dutch semiconductor equipment powerhouse, reported first-quarter sales of €7.7 billion — slightly below forecasts — and flagged “greater uncertainty” due to trade tensions. ASML makes the machines essential for cutting-edge chip production, giving it enormous influence over global chip supply. The company warned that new tariffs and tech restrictions could weigh on its outlook for 2025 and 2026.\r\nInvestors didn’t like what they saw.\r\nNvidia stock slid 6% at the market open Wednesday and retreated further in the afternoon before closing down about 7%, with AMD (AMD) and other chipmakers falling in tandem. The broader Nasdaq dropped over 3%, as Wall Street reassessed what a prolonged, escalating tech standoff could mean for supply chains, AI development, and the semiconductor industry.\r\nIn a Wednesday note, Jefferies (JEF) analysts said the H20 ban was expected — but the size of Nvidia’s write-down was not. It signals outsized demand from Chinese buyers, who had reportedly placed $16 billion in H20 orders this year. Still, Jefferies says China has likely stockpiled enough GPUs for ongoing AI training and will increasingly lean on local chips for inferencing tasks.\r\nMarkets may have priced in some pain, but they haven’t seen the last punch.\r\nFor the latest news,Facebook,TwitterandInstagram."

      "body": "Markets\r\nHot Stocks\r\nFear & Greed Index\r\nLatest Market News\r\nHot Stocks\r\nFollow:\r\nNvidia is caught in the middle of an escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies.\r\nNvidia on Tuesday said it will take a $5.5 billion financial hit after Washington placed fresh restrictions on the export of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, in the latest escalation of a growing battle for AI dominance.\r\nNvidia (NVDA) slumped 6.87% Wednesday after tumbling during premarket trading. The export restrictions on Nvidia come as President Donald Trump’s tariffs are roiling global markets and raising concerns about the prospects for global economic growth.\r\nThe World Trade Organization on Wednesday said its expectations for global trade this year have “deteriorated sharply” owing to the battery of new tariffs on goods and uncertainty around future trade policy.\r\nThe H20 chip, released just last year, was purposefully made to accommodate stringent US export controls to China and allowed Nvidia to continue selling to the country. The model has less computing power than the more powerful H100 AI chip, which has already beenbanned for saleto China.\r\n“Nvidia specifically designed the H20 to comply with US exports restrictions…now the rules change and they lost $5 billion,” said Jay Hatfield, chief executive at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. “So this inconsistent trade policy is costing companies a lot of money.”\r\nThe H20 is believed to have contributed to DeepSeek’s successful development of its ChatGPT-like reasoning AI model, R1, which was said to be trained at a fraction of the cost of American equivalents. The development stunned the tech industry and sparked an AI revolution in China.\r\nNvidia said in a Tuesday regulatoryfilingthat it was informed by the US government last week the H20 chips would now require a special license to be exported to China, which accounted for13% of saleslast year.\r\nThe chipmaker said it will report approximately $5.5 billion worth of charges in its first quarter’s earnings on May 28, associated with H20 products for “inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.”\r\nAnalysts led by Dan Ives, global head of technology research at financial services firm Wedbush Securities, said the financial impact is small relatively, but the restrictions mark a “strategic blow” for Nvidia’s efforts to continue engaging its Chinese customers.\r\n“This disclosure is a clear sign that Nvidia now has massive restrictions and hurdles in selling to China as the Trump Administration knows there is one chip and company fueling the AI Revolution and it’s Nvidia,” they said in a Tuesday research note.\r\nThe industry-leading AI chip designer has been caught in the crossfire in recent years as the US seeks to block China’s use of American technology to advance its military and AI systems.\r\nThe US Commerce Department confirmed on Tuesday it was issuing new export licensing requirements on China-related exports of Nvidia’s H20 and another American AI chipmaker AMD’s MI308 chips, as well as their equivalents, according to Reuters.\r\n“The Commerce Department is committed to acting on the President’s directive to safeguard our national and economic security,” a Commerce Department spokesperson was quoted as saying.\r\nNvidia was told the license requirement would be in place indefinitely, the company said in the filing. It is unclear how the US government would grant the licenses. The company declined to comment beyond its filing.\r\nWhilethe Trump administration’s imposition of curbs on the H20 chips was widely expected,the restriction was more abrupt than anticipated, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a Wednesday note.\r\nSince DeepSeek’s R1 model shook global markets earlier this year, American lawmakers on both sides of the aislejointly calledfor tighter export controls on AI chips.\r\nIn the months since, China has seen an AI boom, with DeepSeek’s reveal galvanizing investment and pressure on Chinese companies to advance its AI sector. Investor confidence in the country’s tech sector has surged, driving rallies in China and Hong Kong stocks.\r\nDeepSeek, along with many of China’s established tech giants, have been major consumers of Nvidia’s H20 graphic processing units. While Chinese tech heavy weight Huawei and AI chipmaker Cambroon have developed alternatives to H20s, those China-made chips generally lag in performance, particularly in software maturity, according to Brady Wang, associate director of Counterpoint Research, a market analysis firm.\r\nThe performance gap between Chinese chips and Nvidia’s is expected to widen, Wang said, because of “Nvidia’s superior ecosystem and manufacturing advantages,” even as  DeepSeek’s rise demonstrates that high-performing AI models can be trained with lower-spec hardware.\r\nThe prospects for the global economy have taken a knock because of Trump’s trade war, according to a new report by the WTO.\r\nThe WTO projects global economies willgrow more slowlythan they would without tariffs — especially in North America, a region dominated by the United States, which will see a greater slowdown than other areas.\r\nThe WTO said it expects global gross domestic product to expand by 2.2% this year. That growth would be 0.6 percentage points lower than the rate it would expect in a scenario with no additional tariffs.\r\nIn North America, the impact will be more severe still, with GDP growth expected to be 1.6 percentage points below what it would be otherwise.\r\nWith the escalation of an aggressive trade war between the US and China, Ives said further restrictions may be coming.\r\n“While the Nvidia news is concerning, it’s not a shock as we are in the middle of a trade war between the US and China and expect more punches thrown by both sides,” he said.\r\nIn 2022, President Joe Biden began curbing the sale of advanced semiconductors from chipmakers like Nvidia to China over concerns that they could power its military. The controls have subsequently expanded to include restrictions on sales of chipmaking equipment,high-bandwidth memory chipsand products manufactured outside the US using American technology in order to limit China’s technological progress.\r\nRelated articleBiden unveils last round of AI chip curbs aimed at China, Russia\r\nBefore Biden stepped down, his administration also broadened the geographic scope of those restrictions, unveiling a global export framework that subjects countries to different restrictions in a bid to prevent advanced AI technology from getting into the hands of adversaries like China through third countries. The new rules are expected to take effect next month.\r\nThe series of restrictions have come under repeated criticism from US tech giants, particularly Nvidia, which says they will undercut US competitiveness.\r\nNed Finkle, Nvidia’s vice president of government affairs, wrote in a companyblog postthat the adoption of AI around the world fuels growth and opportunity for industries at home and abroad. But the restrictions put that global progress “in jeopardy” and threatened to “derail innovation and economic growth worldwide,” he said.\r\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025.\r\nOn April 4, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives appeared on CNBC to discuss the potential impact of current tariffs and compared the situation to an economic armageddon. If the current tariffs remain in place, Ives thinks it would lead to a 15% to 20% demand reduction across the board. He thinks that investor anxiety is much higher considering how things were in the March 2020 COVID-19 crash earlier. The analyst thinks that investors should now focus on the likelihood of tariff adjustments from comments about negotiations, the impact on consumer-focused companies, and the potential for demand destruction. He even thinks that companies may refuse to provide guidance in the first-quarter earnings calls due to the persistent tariff uncertainty.\r\nIves thinks that a lot of tech companies will not be able to absorb high tariff increases and rather this cost will be passed on to the consumers which will lead to significant margin erosion and even potential sales declines. He indicated that tech stocks are currently pricing in a 10% to 15% cut to numbers. He suggests that investors should now look at companies with strong long-term potential as he believes earnings may normalize in 2025 and 2026. The analyst also addressed the defensive performance of defense contractors. While acknowledging the relative stability here, Ives cautioned that even these even such sectors are not immune to tariffs. He noted the significant foreign component, specifically 40% to 50% in some instances, in hardware and other sectors.\r\nWe sifted through the financial media reports to compile a list of the top NASDAQ stocks to buy for 2025. We then selected the 13 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\r\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here)."

The rally was supported by a weakening U.S. dollar and selling pressure on U.S. Treasuries, reflecting growing concerns about the U.S. economic outlook under President Donald Trump.\r\nTrump announced a 145% cumulative tariff on Chinese imports earlier this week, with additional levies under consideration for electronics and pharmaceuticals. China responded with a 125% tariff on U.S. goods. While the U.S. president exempted electronics from the latest measures and granted a 90-day reprieve on reciprocal tariffs for select countries, the shifting policy stance left markets unsettled.\r\nNvidia warned Tuesday that the company faces a $5.5 billion charge in the first quarter due to U.S. restrictions on semiconductor exports to China. The company said the move may limit sales opportunities in one of the world's largest chip markets. Nvidia shares fell 8.79% to $102.34 following the disclosure, leading declines in tech-heavy indices and sparking losses among chipmakers in Asia. The curbs could also restrict access to artificial intelligence components for Chinese firms, increasing the risk of further retaliatory trade actions.\r\nSilver futures rose 0.5% to $32.455 per ounce, while platinum futures slipped 0.1% to $968.95 per ounce.

As a result, TSMC is in a solid position to benefit from the secular growth of the global semiconductor market, which is expected to hit $2 trillion in annual revenue in 2032.\r\nThat would be more than triple the $656 billion in revenue that the semiconductor industry generated last year. However,TSMC stockhas been caught in the tariff turmoil of late, which explains why it is down more than 20% in 2025 as of this writing. But this pullback has made TSMC a terrific bargain.\r\nLet's look at the reasons why buying TSMC looks like a no-brainer right now.\r\nTSMC enjoys a massive lead in the foundry market with an estimated share of 67%, according to Counterpoint Research. That figure has been heading higher in recent quarters. Specifically, TSMC's foundry market share increased by six percentage points in 2024. Meanwhile, second-placed Samsung lost ground in this market as its share shrank by three points to 11%.\r\nA key reason why TSMC has been able to open such a huge gap over rivals in the foundry market is because of its technological advantage. TSMC's advanced process nodes allow its customers to manufacture powerful and power-efficient chips. For example, TSMC's 3-nanometer (nm) node is considered to be the most advanced chip manufacturing technology.\r\nThis process node is being used to manufacture smartphone chips and PC processors by the likes of AMD, MediaTek, Apple, andQualcomm. Now, it looks like Nvidia will tap TSMC's 3nm process node to manufacture its next-generation Rubin graphics processing units (GPUs). Looking ahead, TSMC is looking to push the envelope further in chip manufacturing technology with the 2-nanometer process.\r\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is818%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\r\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now…\r\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\r\nThe company is expected to start mass-producing its 2nm processors in the second half of this year, which could put it ahead of rivals Samsung andIntel. Meanwhile, TSMC is also looking to diversify its global presence. The company has pledged an investment of $165 billion in the U.S. to build advanced chip manufacturing facilities that will powerartificial intelligence (AI)applications.\r\nIt is worth noting that TSMC already fabricates chips for the leading AI semiconductor companies such as Nvidia, Broadcom, andMarvell, and its focus on boosting investments in advanced technologies should allow it to maintain its dominant position in the global foundry market. Additionally, TSMC's strategy of diversifying its global manufacturing footprint in countries such as Japan, the U.S., and Europe could turn out to be a smart move in the long run as it could help it mitigate the challenges arising out of potential trade-related conflicts, such as the one we are witnessing right now.\r\nSo, it won't be surprising to see TSMC remaining the top semiconductor foundry for a long time to come, and that's expected to translate into robust financial growth for the company.\r\nTSMC finished 2024 with $90 billion in revenue, an improvement of 30% from the prior year. The company has got off to a stronger start in 2025, recording a solid 42% jump in revenue in the first three months of the year to $25.6 billion. That's better than what the market was anticipating. Analysts expect TSMC's growth to gain momentum as the year progresses, as evident from the chart below.\r\n\r\nTSM Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Yeardata byYCharts\r\nWhat's more, the chart above also tells us that TSMC is on track to deliver robust growth over the next couple of years as well. Importantly, it won't be surprising to see the company sustaining its solid growth for a much longer period in light of the points discussed in the article. The semiconductor market is set to grow at an impressive pace, and TSMC itself sees a total addressable market worth almost $250 billion in its foundry and packaging services.\r\nThat figure could be bigger in the future as the size of the semiconductor market keeps growing. Not surprisingly, TSMC management expects to maintain an annual revenue growth rate of 20% for the next five years, which should translate into robust bottom-line growth as well. All this makes TSMC a topsemiconductor stockto buy right now as it is trading at just 22 times trailing earnings and 17 times forward earnings, which is a nice discount to the tech-ladenNasdaq-100index's forward earnings multiple of 27 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturingwasn’t one of them.

However, if you're investing in stocks for the long term, the benefits are extremely rewarding.\r\nA great example would have been buying shares of quality companies amid the market chaos of 2020. Five years ago, around April 14, 2020, theS&P 500was already down nearly 13.5% for that year despite being in the midst of a rebound after a steep decline in March due to the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic.While it wasn't an easy time to buy stocks given the uncertainty ahead, doing so could have resulted in some significant gains for investors.\r\nStrategy(MSTR0.35%),Celsius Holdings(CELH-0.98%), andNvidia(NVDA-7.03%)have all generated monstrous gains for investors in just the past five years.\r\nIf you had invested $5,000 into each one of these stocks in April 2020, you'd have well up over $300,000 today. Here's a look at how much those investments would be worth as of April 16, and whether these stocks are still good buys right now.\r\nThe best-performing stock on this list is Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy. It would have turned a $5,000 investment into roughly $126,750 over just a five-year stretch. It's an astounding performance, especially when you consider that the main reason investors are bullish on it is for its position inBitcoin-- it prides itself on being the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency.\r\nYet, investing $5,000 into the digital currency itself would have grown to a more modest sum of $63,000. Strategy has been the better investment. Despite posting volatile earnings numbers that sometimes feature massive seven-figure losses, its favorable position on Bitcoin has been a big reason for its rapid rise in value.\r\nWhile it technically provides companies with business intelligence solutions, Strategy has risen primarily due to the hype and excitement relating to crypto. Its fundamentals don't support its sizable $80 billion-plus market cap. This is a highly speculative and volatile investment, and investors shouldn't assume that because thetech stockhas done so well in the past five years, it will be able to replicate these types of returns in the future.\r\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is818%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\r\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now…\r\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\r\nEnergy drink company Celsius Holdings has made for a tremendous growth stock over the years, establishing itself as one of the top companies in the industry over that time frame. A $5,000 investment in the business five years ago would now be worth a staggering $129,400 -- and this is even with shares of Celsius falling more than 50% over the past 12 months.\r\nMoving forward, the company can still be an appealing investment given its focus on the sugar-free market, where it can be a big player. It recently announced plans to acquire Alani Nutrition, which will expand its presence in that area. Last year, Celsius' sales grew by just 3% to $1.4 billion, but with much more growth still on the horizon for the business, it may not be too late to invest in the stock.\r\nChipmaker Nvidia has been a top stock to own due to its growth in artificial intelligence (AI). It plays a vital role in helping businesses expand their AI capabilities. It may seem surprising that the stock isn't higher on this list, but that's largely because oftariffsand the economic uncertainty ahead for the tech industry as a whole, and the risk that spending on chips may slow down in the near future.\r\nNvidia's five-year returns are still impressive, however, and the stock would have turned a $5,000 investment into close to $73,000 today. The company's dominance in AI chips makes it a strong buy moving forward as Nvidia's robust earnings and growth make it likely the business will become even more valuable in the future, and any dip in price could be an attractive buying opportunity for investors.\r\nIn its most recent fiscal year, which ended in January, the company reported over $130.5 billion in sales (more than double what it generated a year earlier), and profits of $72.9 billion soared from $29.8 billion in the previous year. Nvidia has been a growth machine, and even if business slows down in the near term, this can still make for an excellent long-term buy.\r\nIn total, a $15,000 investment across all these stocks five years ago would now be worth a staggering $329,000.These massive returns should remind investors that buying when sentiment is poor may not be as bad a time to invest in the stock market as it may appear to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inNvidia, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andNvidiawasn’t one of them.

The semiconductor foundry leader's share price closed out the day down 3.6% after having been off as much as 5.6% in the session. Meanwhile, theS&P 500(^GSPC-2.24%)andNasdaq Composite(^IXIC-3.07%)fell 2.2% and 3.1% in the session, respectively.\r\nTSMC's valuation moved lower today in conjunction with news of new export restrictions onNvidia's processors, higher tariffs on China, and cautious commentary from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The stock is now down 23% year to date.\r\nNvidia submitted a filing yesterday disclosing a significant new business headwind. The company is now being required to submit for an export license if it wants to sell more of its H20 processors to China, which likely means that the product will be barred from being sold to the country.\r\nTSMC manufactures the chip designs for the processors, and the foundry specialist could see overall demand pressured by new restrictions preventing advanced artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductors from being sold into the Chinese market.\r\nTSMC stock also sold off today in response to news that the U.S.'s tariffs on China will be raised to 245% and commentary from Jerome Powell on the potential impacts of the new export taxes. Powell indicated that the Fed would hold off on cutting interest rates until the potential inflationary impacts of new tariffs became more clear.\r\nAccording to a report published byDigiTimestoday, TSMC intends to increase the prices on its 4nm chips by 30% in response to surging demand. The news suggests that the company should continue to post very strong sales growth in the near term, but there are still some big risk factors on the horizon. TSMC looks poised to be the leading manufacturer of advanced chips for AI applications for the foreseeable future, but its significance in the escalating tensions between the U.S. and China means the stock comes with outsized geopolitical risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturingwasn’t one of them.

      "body": "(Bloomberg) -- China wants to see a number of steps from President Donald Trump’s administration before it will agree to trade talks, including showing more respect by reining in disparaging remarks by members of his cabinet, according to a person familiar with the Chinese government’s thinking.\r\nMost Read from Bloomberg\r\nTrump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space\r\nHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?\r\nWhy the Best Bike Lanes Always Get Blamed\r\nDOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on Leave\r\nLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs\r\nOther conditions include a more consistent US position and a willingness to address China’s concerns around American sanctions and Taiwan, said the person, who asked not to be identified to discuss internal thinking.\r\nFollow the The Big Take daily podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\r\nBeijing also wants the US to appoint a point person for talks who has the president’s support and can help prepare a deal that Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping can sign when they meet, the person said.\r\nThe fate of the global economy and financial markets hinges in large part on whether the US and China can find a way to avoid a protracted trade war. Trump has hit China with tariffs of 145% on most goods since taking office, prompting Beijing to retaliate and threatening to wipe out most trade between the world’s biggest economies.\r\nThe offshore yuan gained 0.2% against the dollar in the wake of the report. The Australian dollar, a China-proxy currency, also advanced 0.5%. S&P 500 Index futures pared losses from as much as 1.6% earlier in the session. The benchmark closed 2.2% lower on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that trade tensions risk undermining the central bank’s employment and inflation goals.\r\nThe rapid onslaught of US tariffs has engendered broad public support in China for retaliation, giving Xi a political incentive to rebuff Trump’s repeated demands for a phone call. The US leader on Tuesday again called on China to reach out to him in order to kick off negotiations to resolve the trade fight.\r\nIt’s unclear what will produce a breakthrough to get talks moving. While both sides have indicated they’re open to negotiations, Trump appears determined to get Xi on the phone straight away while China wants any conversation between the leaders to produce a clear outcome.\r\nEven then if they agree on process, fundamental questions persist on what any agreement would look like. Trump’s demands remain unclear, and tariff levels on China would need to remain high to achieve his goal of balancing trade and attracting manufacturers to the US."

That decision comes after earlier setbacks tied to severe nausea in its twice-daily versionand leaves Pfizer even further behind in a weight-loss market expected to hit $130 billion by 2030. With demand for Covid products fading fast, the company had pinned big hopes on obesity drugs to fill the gap. Instead, it's now heading back to the drawing board.\r\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with PFE.\r\nThe market didn't take the news lightly. Pfizer shares dropped around 1% premarket 8.59am, while rivals popped. Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) jumped 2.75%, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) rose 2.27% , and Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX) soared nearly 20% in the premarket trading at the same timeall riding momentum from stronger weight-loss offerings. Lilly's Zepbound, a once-weekly injectable, is already generating nearly $5 billion a year and has an oral version in the final stretch of trials. Structure Therapeutics and AstraZeneca aren't far behind, with their own oral contenders in the pipeline.\r\nThis misstep throws more heat on Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who's under pressure to offset looming patent cliffs that could wipe out $15 billion in revenue by decade's end. So far, the pipeline hasn't delivered, and the M&A spree hasn't produced a clear winner. As competitors rack up approvals and market share, Pfizer may have to rethink its next moveand fast. Investors will be watching closely to see if another round of strategic acquisitions is in the cards.\r\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus."

      "body": "Pfizer still has another obesity pill in development, PF-07976016, which is currently in a Phase IIa trial.\r\nPfizer has terminated the development of its oral obesity candidate danuglipron after a patient on a clinical trial with the drug suffered a liver injury.\r\nThe oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) was being investigated in chronic weight management in several Phase I andPhase II trials.\r\nThe gold standard of business intelligence.\r\nFind out more\r\nTwo Phase I studies (NCT06567327 and NCT06568731) met pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints and determined a formulation and dose for danuglipron. In one of these studies, an asymptomatic patient experienced a potential drug-induced liver injury. The injury resolved after drug discontinuation; however, Pfizer has decided, based on this event, available clinical data, and recent input from regulators to discontinue the development of the drug. The therapy has been investigated in a total of 1,400 patients.\r\nChief scientific officer and president of R&D at Pfizer, Dr. Chris Boshoff said: “While we are disappointed to discontinue the development of danuglipron, we remain committed to evaluating and advancing promising programs in an effort to bring innovative new medicines to patients.”\r\nPfizer will be presenting data from the studies at an upcoming medical conference and peer-reviewed journal.\r\nUnlike some of its big pharma competitors, Pfizer has not had much luck in the obesity pill space. In December 2023, the company stopped the development of the twice-daily version of danuglipron due tohigh rates of gastrointestinal side effects. This came six months after the company hadculled another oral GLP-1-RA candidate, lotiglipron, due to associated high transaminase levels.\r\nThe company still has another oral obesity candidate in trials, a once daily glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor antagonist, PF-07976016. The therapy is being investigated in a Phase IIa trial (NCT06717425), which was initiated in December 2024.\r\nPfizer faces fierce competition in the obesity space, especially from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, both of which have cemented a reputation with their subcutaneous GLP-1RA therapies Wegovy (semaglutide) and Zepbound (tirzepatide), respectively.\r\nEli Lilly is also looking to enter the oral obesity space and is running a Phase III programme of its daily pill orforglipron. GlobalData predicts sales of orforglipron to reach $11.8bn in 2030.\r\nGlobalDatais the parent company ofClinical Trials Arena.\r\nBiotechs are also making headway in the obesity arena. Viking Therapeutics is studying an oral version of the weight loss therapy VK2735 in an ongoing Phase II study (NCT06828055), and its subcutaneous formulation is set to enter a Phase III trial in Q2 2025.\r\nPfizer’s stock, listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), remains stable despite the danuglipron announcement. Meanwhile, Viking’s stock, listed on the Nasdaq exchange, jumped by 21% at market open today (14 April).\r\n\r\nThe gold standard of business intelligence.\r\nFind out more\r\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\r\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\r\n\r\nVisit ourPrivacy Policyfor more information about our services, how we may use, process and share your personal data, including information on your rights in respect of your personal data and how you can unsubscribe from future marketing communications.

      "body": "We recently published a list of10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar.\r\nOn Thursday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer cautioned viewers about what may lie ahead once the 90-day pause on new tariffs comes to an end. While discussing the latest Consumer Price Index report, Cramer acknowledged that the numbers looked favorable, with inflation appearing relatively tame and even some categories experiencing actual price declines. He pointed to energy prices, saying, “The best, anything it touched energy, which is plummeting.”\r\nREAD ALSO:Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocksand10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently.\r\n“This is essentially an embargo. President Trump’s ecstatic that the tariffs are already taking in $2 billion a day. He’s thrilled that supposedly 75 countries are begging for something more reasonable than the 90-day pause when the 90-day pause comes to an end.”\r\nAccording to Cramer, President Trump is “ecstatic” that these tariffs are already generating $2 billion a day in revenue and is thrilled about 75 countries “supposedly” asking for something more workable once the 90-day grace period concludes. Despite the seemingly positive revenue flow, Cramer expressed concern over the broader consequences. He pointed out that many Americans have yet to grasp the full impact of trade policies that have allowed foreign businesses to flood U.S. markets with inexpensive products, often pricing out domestic companies.\r\nWhile many consumers embraced the lower costs, Cramer reminded his audience that it came at the expense of American jobs. “Now we’re going to have to pay a price. He stressed that consumers should be prepared to pay significantly more for a wide range of goods. He said that the additional cost largely will likely benefit foreign companies, which will hike prices in response to the tariffs imposed on them. He clarified his position by stating he is not a staunch advocate of free trade for its own sake. “No other country plays by the rules on trade, so we shouldn’t either,” he said but cautioned:\r\n“We just have to be more thoughtful about this or we’ll end up doing more harm than good. Again, as someone who wants fair trade, not free trade, I am rooting for the president to pull this off, but not at the expense of great American companies that have done nothing wrong and are the best in the world.”\r\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds."

      "title": "Pfizer (NYSE PFE) Discontinues Danuglipron Development After Safety Review in Study",
      "body": "Pfizerrecently announced the cessation of Danuglipron's development, an event that coincided with a 3% decline in its share price over the past week. This move was primarily due to safety concerns in clinical studies. Despite achieving key pharmacokinetic goals, the discovery of a potential drug-induced liver injury prompted Pfizer to reassess its strategy. This decision adds weight to the company's stock performance, contrasting with broader market trends, where major indexes experienced upward movement amidst tariff-related developments and positive gains in tech sectors. Pfizer's decision highlights the importance of rigorous safety evaluations in pharmaceutical developments.\r\nWe've discovered 3 warning signs for Pfizer (2 are significant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\r\nExplore 22 top quantum computing companies leading the revolution in next-gen technology and shaping the future with breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, superconducting qubits, and cutting-edge research.\r\nThe cessation of Danuglipron’s development could significantly influence Pfizer's revenue and earnings forecasts moving forward. By prioritizing rigorous safety measures, Pfizer may face setbacks in accelerating R&D productivity and the associated revenue streams. This shift may lead to a more conservative approach in pipeline-driven growth expectations and could delay anticipated financial impacts from new products, potentially further pressuring revenue forecasts already impacted by legislative changes. The development halt aligns with observed market volatility around Pfizer shares, shedding light on investor concerns regarding the company's future earning capabilities amidst evolving challenges in the pharmaceutical sector.\r\nOver the past year, Pfizer's total return, including dividends, was a 10.14% decline, signaling underperformance relative to both the broader market and the US Pharmaceuticals industry, which experienced negative returns of 8.6%. During this period, the company's earnings showed considerable growth from a very low base, yet they have not matched market expectations overall. Notably, analysts have set a fair value price target of US$26.02, suggesting upside potential compared to the current share price of US$22.49. However, this assumes improvements in profit margins and financial performance that are not without risk given current operational challenges and headwinds from pricing reforms in Medicare.\r\nUnderstand Pfizer's track record by examining our performance history report.\r\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.We provide commentary based on historical data and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your financial situation.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Bank of America Corporation (BAC), Chevron Corporation (CVX) and Stryker Corporation (SYK), as well as two micro-cap stocks Value Line, Inc. (VALU) and Sypris Solutions, Inc. (SYPR). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You cansee all of today’s research reports here >>>Today's Featured Research ReportsShares ofBank of Americahave gained +2.5% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry’s gain of +20.4%. The company’s volatile nature of the trading business is a major headwind. Despite an impressive performance since 2022, it is expected to normalize going forward. This is likely to hamper fee income growth.The Zacks analyst project non-interest income to rise only 3.4% in 2025. Continued investments in the franchise will keep the company’s expenses elevated. We expect total non-interest expenses to rise 3% this year. While high funding costs are still a woe, the company’s net interest income (NII) will be positively impacted by higher rates for longer.The Zacks analyst expects NII to record a CAGR of 5.3% over the next three years. Plans to open financial centers in new and existing markets and improve digital capabilities will aid the top line. We project total revenues to grow 4.8% in 2025.(You canread the full research report on Bank of America here >>>)Chevron’sshares have declined -6.2% over the past six months against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry’s decline of -11.9%. The company being a fully integrated energy firm, is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin.Further, the planned acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana. However, the company is grappling with high sensitivity to oil fluctuations and relatively expensive valuation.Another concern is the weak margins on refined products that forced its downstream segment to its first quarterly loss in 4 years. Considering these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.(You canread the full research report on Chevron here >>>)Shares ofStrykerhave gained +4.3% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Products industry’s gain of +5.5%. The company is poised for growth, driven by rising demand for robotic-assisted procedures, hospital capital expenditures and international expansion. The Mako SmartRobotics platform fuels adoption, while acquisitions like Inari Medical and Vertos Medical enhance the portfolio.Stryker is actively integrating new technologies such as AI-driven imaging and smart surgical systems to improve patient outcomes and maintain its competitive edge. Pricing improvements and a strong hospital order book support 2025 growth.However, foreign exchange volatility and acquisition-related margin pressures may impact earnings. Supply chain disruptions and rising costs could strain profitability. Intensifying competition in robotics and MedTech demands constant innovation. Macroeconomic risks, including potential downturns in healthcare spending and regulatory shifts, add uncertainty.(You canread the full research report on Stryker here >>>)Value Line’sshares have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry over the past year (+10% vs. +6.4%).

EAM Trust income surged 47.7% to $13.8 million, driven by AUM growth to $5 billion, providing a rising, diversified passive income stream.The company maintains disciplined capital returns, paying $0.90/share in dividends and repurchasing shares, with $0.9 million authorization remaining. Portfolio gains doubled to $3.6 million, bolstering earnings. Strong branding and diversified offerings serve both retail and institutional clients, supporting market position.However, core publishing revenue declined to $26.7 million, and customer concentration (30% from one client) heightens risk. Operating costs and taxes rose, further pressuring margins, while limited international presence (~2% of revenues) increases vulnerability to U.S. market shifts.(You canread the full research report on Value Line here >>>)Shares ofSypris Solutionshave gained +3.6% over the past year against the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry’s gain of +36.3%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $36.37 million benefits from an extended long-term supply agreement with a global OEM, securing stable revenues as a sole-source supplier of Ultra Axle Shafts.Sypris Solutions’ diversified presence across automotive, energy, and industrial markets reduces risk and positions it to capitalize on growth trends in heavy-duty vehicles and energy infrastructure. Sypris Solutions is also aligned with growth in aerospace and defense electronics, leveraging its capabilities in high-precision components to meet rising demand. Expansion into the Asia-Pacific region aligns with high-growth markets, leveraging regional investments in defense and infrastructure.However, liquidity challenges constrain financial flexibility. Rising costs and reliance on cyclical markets such as heavy vehicles and oil and gas exacerbate margin sensitivity. Competitive pressures in aerospace further heighten vulnerability.(You canread the full research report on Sypris Solutions here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Pfizer Inc.

      "body": "Pfizer (PFE) isending a late-stage trialof its once-daily GLP-1 pill, Danuglipron, after a participant experienced a liver injury. Yahoo Finance Senior ReporterAnjalee Khemlanijoins Market Domination Overtime to break down the details, as well as preview what to watch as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) prepares to report earnings.\r\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtimehere.\r\nPfizer announcing today that it is halting a late stage trial of its GLP-1 pill candidate. And Yahoo! Finance's very own Angelina Kamlani joins us now with the latest, Ange.\r\nJosh, that's right. We heard from Pfizer today that it is choosing to halt its phase three trial of danuglipron, that is its once daily oral pill that was supposed to be a really good competitor in the market. They said that they stopped it because one of the clinical trial participants had a liver injury and after getting off the pill was able to recover. So that is where things stand. This is, you know, really a bumpy ride for Pfizer and the end to it essentially for this one molecule. We'll have to see what the company decides to do. If you take a look at the stock, though, it didn't really move much on the news today, Wall Street seemed to kind of shrug it off, and it seems that analysts are looking at maybe the company looking inwardly through its pipeline or externally to acquire something to get it into the obesity space. Uh we got Akash Tewari from Jefferies saying that we're removing danuglipron from our model and lowering the price target for Pfizer as a result from $34 to $32, and we view this as another frustrating hit to management's credibility. The company has really been under the watch of investors for some time, and you can see on your screen the struggle that it had to really enter this obesity space already, ending one candidate earlier on in June 23rd because of similar liver issues, and then looking at twice daily danuglipron having to scrap that, then advancing once daily and now scrapping that as well. That leaves Eli Lilly as the only contender in the marketplace, uh, for a pill, as well as, of course, already a market leader with the injectables. So, really hot obesity space that Pfizer is missing out on, and investors are looking at what it can do to really get the next blockbuster out of its pipeline. I guess we'll have to wait till earnings at the end of the month to hear more about that.\r\nAnge, healthcare is such a big business, but if you get it right, you make a lot of money. Johnson & Johnson reports earnings tomorrow. Any wisdom, what to expect?\r\nYeah, we're definitely keeping an eye on a few things for Johnson & Johnson. Of course, it is a maker of medical devices, which we know have been hit by the tariffs as well as a pharmaceutical manufacturing, which has been, uh, looked at as having some sort of special tariffs that we've heard from President Trump. So, we're looking on any kind of impact from those conversations, as well as broader tariff impact on guidance. We've seen a couple of companies pull, and we'll see if Johnson & Johnson does so as well. We do know the company has committed to $55 billion in US manufacturing. So we'll have to see how that all shakes out when the company, uh, lets us know tomorrow morning.\r\nAnge, thank you. Appreciate it."

Under the law, the Commerce Secretary is expected to deliver the results of his investigation within 270 days, though Trump and other officials have signaled these efforts could conclude more quickly.\r\nThe US president has long decried foreign production of drugs and chips as a threat to national security and threatened to slap tariffs on imports in a bid to revive American manufacturing of those products. But the duties could also wreak havoc on supply chains and drive up costs for Americans.\r\nNew levies threaten to roil a chips industry that notched more than $600 billion in global sales of semiconductors essential to products ranging from cars to airplanes and mobile phones to consumer electronics. Supply chains still feeling the effect of disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic now could face new strains from the US duties.\r\nThe administration’s announcement came days after it exempted semiconductors, mobile phones, computers and other electronics imports from 145% duties applied to China. That announcement was seen as a boon to tech giants like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., but Trump and his advisers quickly said the relief would be short lived and that separate levies would be placed on chips.\r\nThe Commerce Department investigation on semiconductors is designed to have a wide range, evaluating imports of both legacy and leading-edge chips that are coveted for artificial intelligence applications. The probe will span imports of all semiconductors and the equipment used to manufacture them as well as electronic products that contain the components, according to the government notice."

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\r\nKey Points\r\nPfizer(PFE-1.74%)recently reminded investors how risky the drug-development business can be. On April 14, the company told investors it would scrap development of danuglipron, its oral GLP-1 candidate for weight management. The stock has been trading about 63% below its all-time high.\r\nPfizer's stock price is way down, but the quarterly dividend it pays has risen for 16 consecutive years. At its beaten-down price, the stock offers an eye-popping 7.8% yield.\r\nIf Pfizer continues its dividend-raising streak, investors who buy at recent prices could realize market-beating gains over the long run. Let's look a little closer at danuglipron, plus some bigger problems the company faces, to see if this stock could be a smart buy on the dip.\r\nThe end of Pfizer's danuglipron program highlights just how risky the drug-development process can be. According to the company, it discontinued development after just one patient in a dose-optimization study experienced a liver injury that could have been caused by the experimental GLP-1 pill.\r\nThe danuglipron program's termination is disappointing, but it won't be the end of Pfizer's attempt to developblockbusterweight-management drugs. The company has an oral glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) antagonist in phase 2 trials. Investors will probably hear more about this candidate, tentatively named PF-07976016, down the road.\r\nA disappointing outcome for a weight-management candidate isn't anywhere near the top of Pfizer's list of problems. Investors should be far more concerned with an upcoming loss of patent-protected market exclusivity for Eliquis. Sales of the oral blood thinner it markets in partnership withBristol-Myers Squibbrose to $7.4 billion, or 11.6% of total revenue last year.\r\nEliquis is expected to lose patent-protected exclusivity in 2026, although generic competition in the U.S. market isn't expected to begin until 2028. Pfizer's second-largest revenue stream in 2024 could also start drying up soon. The Prevnar family of vaccines was responsible for over 10% of total sales last year. Prevnar 13 is expected to lose patent-protected exclusivity in the U.S. next year.\r\nVyndaqel has been a strong growth driver for Pfizer but probably not for much longer. This treatment prevents heart damage caused by transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis and grew sales by 64% to reach $5.4 billion last year.Bridge BioandAlnylamare now marketing competing treatments for the limited population of TTR amyloidosis patients with heart damage. In addition to competing treatments, Vyndaqel is expected to face generic competition in the U.S. in 2028.\r\nDrug developers need to communicate with regulators at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before, during, and after they run clinical trials for new drug candidates. In the U.S., many of those regulators recently lost their jobs.\r\nIn 2024, the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approved 50 new drugs. The CDER director, Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., stepped down in January and joined Pfizer's C-suite as chief medical officer.\r\nHaving the former CDER director on staff could be advantageous for Pfizer, but I'll be pleasantly surprised if the FDA completes new drug approvals at half the usual pace this year. According to reporting from STAT, more than a few FDA employees involved in the new drug approval process were among thousands recently fired from the agency.\r\nA crippled FDA could be a huge problem for Pfizer and its peers who must constantly launch new drugs to overcome exclusivity losses for established products.\r\nMany investors expect pharmaceutical industry lobbyists to prevent the Trump administration from rendering CDER incapable of reviewing new drug applications at its usual pace. They could be right, but I won't support an investment thesis that relies on industry lobbyists protecting a regulatory agency.\r\nIf you asked me a month ago, I would have called this stock a buy. In 2023, it earned FDA approval for nine new drugs and last year it reported over a dozen product approvals from the agency. With plenty of new products coming online, Pfizer had a good chance to overcome upcoming patent cliffs and maintain its dividend-raising streak.\r\nNow that the CDER has been dramatically downsized, it's probably best to assume the worst. I'll be avoiding this and all drugmaker stocks until we see proof that a much smaller FDA can continue approving new drugs at the usual pace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inPfizer, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andPfizerwasn’t one of them.

      "body": "Obesity stocks likeNovo NordiskNVO,Eli LillyLLY,Structure TherapeuticsGPCR andViking TherapeuticsVKTX gained 2.1%, 3%, 10.6% and 19.2%, respectively, on Monday after pharma bigwigPfizerPFE announced that it is discontinuing the development of its GLP-1R weight loss pill, danuglipron.\r\nPfizer has decided to discontinue the development of its oral obesity drug danuglipron, despite promising results from dose-optimization studies that met key pharmacokinetic goals and showed potential for competitive efficacy and tolerability. Although liver enzyme elevations in the enrolled patients were generally consistent with other approved drugs in the same class, one patient experienced a potential case of drug-induced liver injury, which resolved after stopping treatment with danuglipron.\r\nAfter reviewing all clinical data and considering regulatory feedback, Pfizer concluded that halting the program was the best course of action. This decision reverted Pfizer’s developmental program for an obesity candidate back to the early clinical stages and has significantly delayed its hopes for marketing an obesity drug that would compete with Lilly’s Zepbound and Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy for market share.\r\nHowever, PFE shares have not slid despite the setback, which likely reflects positive investor expectations regarding Pfizer’s ability to bounce back from its current predicament. Pfizer plans to continue the development of its oral GIPR antagonist candidate, PF-07976016, which is currently in mid-stage development and other early-stage obesity programs. Pfizer could also in-license rights to a late-stage obesity candidate from other biotechs for developing and commercialization.\r\nInterestingly, Jefferies reduced Pfizer’s price target from $34 to $32 following the setback, but maintained its BUY rating for the stock.\r\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly currently dominate the obesity market on the back of the tremendous success of their GLP-1 injections. Lilly markets its dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, tirzepatide, as Zepbound for obesity, while Novo Nordisk markets its semaglutide drug as Wegovy injection for weight management.\r\nYear to date, shares of PFE, LLY and NVO have lost 16.6%, 2.3% and 23.2%, respectively, compared with the industry’s 4.9% decline.\r\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\r\nPfizer’s setback eliminates an imminent contender for LLY and NVO’s market share in the obesity space. Both firms have been raking in substantial revenues from the sale of their respective obesity injections. In 2024, Zepbound sales amounted to $4.9 billion, while Wegovy sales recorded $8.4 billion during the same time frame, both representing a substantial increase over their previous year's figures."

Pfizer’s dose-optimization studies of once-daily formulations of danuglipron met key pharmacokinetic objectives and confirmed a formulation and dose with the potential to deliver a competitive efficacy and tolerability profile in Phase 3 testing, based on earlier studies of twice-daily danuglipron. While the overall frequency of liver enzyme elevations across the over 1,400 participant safety database of danuglipron is in-line with approved agents in the class, a single asymptomatic participant in one of the dose-optimization studies experienced potential drug-induced liver injury which resolved after discontinuation of danuglipron. After a review of the totality of information, including all clinical data generated to date for danuglipron and recent input from regulators, Pfizer has decided to discontinue development of the molecule.\r\n“Cardiovascular and metabolic diseases including obesity remain important areas of unmet medical need, and we plan to continue applying our global capabilities to advance a pipeline of investigational treatments that have the potential to fill critical gaps in patient care, including continued development of our oral GIPR antagonist candidate and other earlier obesity programs,” said Chris Boshoff, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Research and Development at Pfizer. “While we are disappointed to discontinue the development of danuglipron, we remain committed to evaluating and advancing promising programs in an effort to bring innovative new medicines to patients.”"

      "body": "PfizerPFE announced that it is discontinuing the development of danuglipron, its investigational oral GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), which is being developed to treat obesity.\r\nThe decision follows a safety signal observed during two dose-optimization studies, in which one study participant experienced a case of potential drug-induced liver injury. Although the individual was asymptomatic and fully recovered after stopping the treatment, Pfizer stated that its decision was based on a comprehensive review of all clinical data generated to date, along with recent regulatory feedback.\r\nWhile the two dose-optimization studies had met key pharmacokinetic goals and identified a dose with the potential for competitive efficacy and tolerability, the safety concerns ultimately led Pfizer to stop further development of danuglipron.\r\nThis is the second time that Pfizer has faced setbacks in connection with the pipeline development of danuglipron. In December 2023, the company announced that it would not move forward with phase III studies on the twice-daily formulation of danuglipron. Though the drug was effective in reducing weight in a phase IIb study, it caused several gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Back then, the company said that the pharmacokinetic study of the once-daily formulation of danuglipron continues, and it will focus on its development.\r\nThis also marks the second time in two years that Pfizer has given up on an obesity drug. Back in 2023, Pfizer had dropped the development of another GLP-1-RA candidate, lotiglipron, due to elevated levels of a type of liver enzymes seen in a study.\r\nFollowing these setbacks, Pfizer has decided to focus on developing its other obesity candidates, which are either in early-stage or mid-stage development. One such candidate is PF-07976016, an investigational GIP receptor being evaluated in a mid-stage study for obesity.\r\nYear to date, shares of Pfizer have lost nearly 17% compared with the industry’s 7% decline.\r\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\r\nPost Pfizer’s announcement, shares ofEli LillyLLY andNovo NordiskNVO rose 3% and 2%, respectively, on Monday. Both companies dominate the diabetes and obesity market on the back of the tremendous success of their GLP-1 products. Lilly markets its dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, tirzepatide, as Mounjaro for type II diabetes and as Zepbound for obesity. Novo markets its semaglutide drugs as Ozempic pre-filled pen and Rybelsus oral tablet for type II diabetes and as Wegovy injection for weight management."

Somewhat counterintuitively, this week's rise came after the company announced it was ending the development of a drug in a very hot product category. On Tuesday, Pfizer's stock closed the day 1.5% higher, providing a pleasant contrast to theS&P 500index's 0.2% dip.\r\nTuesday was a relatively uneventful news day for Pfizer, especially following thepharmaceuticalgiant's disclosure on Monday that it halted the development of its investigational weight loss drugdanuglipron. This occurred after a patient suffered a liver injury during the testing of the medication.\r\nYet Pfizer watchers are well aware that the large and well-resourced company doesn't only have one pony in the race. It has a different treatment in its pipeline, PF-07976016, that's based on a different mechanism and is currently undergoing phase 2 clinical trials.\r\nOne analyst tracking the pharmaceutical stock didn't hesitate to point in a new research note published Tuesday morning that the company still has options. Bernstein SocGen's Courtney Breen wrote in her analysis, according to reports, that Pfizer will likely turn to its tried-and-true strategy of building up its pipeline with mergers and acquisitions, and/or licensing of products developed by peers.\r\nInvestors can be quite a hardy bunch, and collectively they seem to be shrugging off what many would consider a major setback in the lab with danuglipron. That being said, it is a setback, and Pfizer hasn't been a pharmaceutical pace-setter since the days of its Comirnaty vaccine during the coronavirus pandemic.

(NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to expand its recommendation for the use of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines approved for adults 50-59 years of age at increased risk of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD). This includes ABRYSVO®(Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine), which in October 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for the prevention of RSV-associated LRTD in adults aged 18 to 59 at increased risk of severe disease.\r\nAccording to the CDC, between 15,000 - 20,000 RSV-associated hospitalizations occur annually in U.S. adults aged 50 - 59 years.1The risk of hospitalization is highest among those adults with one or more underlying medical conditions such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), asthma, and other chronic or immunocompromising conditions.1With respect to ABRYSVO, ACIP stated:\r\nACIP recommends adults 50–59 years of age who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease receive a single dose of RSV vaccine.\r\n\"With its vote to expand adult RSV vaccination recommendations, ACIP has taken an important step toward protecting individuals aged 50 to 59 who have underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for severe RSV illness,\" said Alejandro Cane, Vice President, Vaccines and Antivirals U.S. Medical Lead, Pfizer. \"We are proud that ABRYSVO has the broadest indication among RSV vaccines, covering older adults, adults 18 and older at heightened risk of severe disease, and pregnant women to help protect infants.\"\r\nThe updated ACIP recommendation, which lowers the recommended age for RSV vaccination from 60 to 50 for high-risk adults, is pending final approval by the director of the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services.\r\nABOUT RSVRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a contagious virus and a common cause of respiratory illness.2The virus can affect the lungs and breathing passages of an infected individual, potentially causing severe illness or death.3,4Chronic cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, moderate or severe immune compromise, diabetes with complications, and severe obesity are among the conditions that increase an individual’s risk for severe RSV.5There are two major subgroups of RSV: RSV-A and RSV-B. Both subgroups cause disease and can co-circulate or alternate predominance from season to season."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other best medical stocks to buy according to billionaires.\r\nSome experts view medical, healthcare, and big pharma stocks as immune from trade carnage, making them a safe haven amid the uncertainty brought about by Trump’s tariffs. On April 8, Mizuho Securities America healthcare sector strategist Jared Holz appeared on CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ to talk about whether the speculations around the healthcare sector being a safe haven during market turmoil are true. He also discussed why healthcare companies are failing to get increased investor respect, given that healthcare is 20% of the American economy, which translates to around 1/5th of the country’s entire national output.\r\nHolz said that the country’s major healthcare and pharmaceutical companies undoubtedly help fight its healthcare problems. However, when we look at their financial models and the way their businesses are currently set up, we have got generic patent cliffs over the next 5-7 years on the medium to long-term angle of the company, along with price concessions with the IRA and some of the things the Biden administration put into place. We have also got pricing degradation over the near term, and between those two lies competition and other setbacks. The models thus never line up well enough for investors to have a lot of confidence, as the business models do not lend themselves to long-term viability. These are the primary reasons the sector and stocks have been under pressure for so long.\r\nREAD ALSO:10 Best Mid Cap Biotech Stocks to Buyand12 Best Diagnostics Stocks to Invest In Right Now.\r\nHolz further opined that managed care, particularly the government-centric names, are somewhat safe as they are insulated from tariffs as US-based companies. In fact, the economic slowdown is actually beneficial for them as they want less utilization and less patience through the system, which is how they typically beat numbers. He said that managed care is having a good day, and investors might think about owning some companies in the sector.\r\nIt is, however, a relative game, as there are several different variables at play, and investors are essentially playing a game of hopscotch in an attempt to jump from one area to another, whether it’s tariffs, drug pricing, or other public policies. He painted a similar picture for medical device stocks that are more US-centric. These two sectors thus have less risk relative to others, making them somewhat of a safe haven."

Revenues are projected to reach $111.01 billion, increasing 11.2% from the same quarter last year.\r\nThe current level reflects an upward revision of 0.1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\r\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\r\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\r\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific UnitedHealth metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\r\nAnalysts expect 'Revenues- Products' to come in at $13.33 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +11.9%.\r\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenues- Services' at $9.76 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +9.8% year over year.\r\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Revenues- Premiums' should come in at $86.94 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +11.5%.\r\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Revenues- Investment and other income' reaching $1.06 billion.

However, the trends in March are not so different from what's happening now, as consumer sentiment was rapidly weakening and fears of a recession were mounting before thetariffannouncement.\r\nLet's take a look at the two best-performingDow Jones Industrial Average(^DJI-1.73%)companies to see if they're worth buying today.\r\nImage source: Getty Images.\r\nUnitedHealth Group(UNH0.30%)is one of the most resilient stocks on the market. Healthcare is considered a recession-proof industry, but health insurance is even more unaffected by the economy because people need coverage regardless.\r\nIt's not a surprise, then, that investors have piled into the stock in March and have continued to do so through the tariff-related chaos of April.\r\nThere was no major company-specific news out on UnitedHealth in March, and investors seem to be returning to the stock after it tumbled following the assassination of one of its executives in December 2024.\r\nUnitedHealth has been one of the rare winners on the stock market in April, gaining 15% thanks to a 5.06% increase in Medicare Advantage benchmarks and its reputation as a port in a storm during turbulent market times.\r\nChevron(CVX0.65%)might seem like a surprise on this list as the energy sector is typically highly sensitive to the economic cycle.\r\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all,Stock Advisor’stotal average return is818%— a market-crushing outperformance compared to156%for the S&P 500.\r\nThey just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy right now…\r\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\r\nThe source of Chevron's gains was a surprising one, as Reuters reported that the company was angling for a piece of the data center market, developing the sites and supplying the electricity for facilities.\r\nData center demand is surging along with AI, and the energy to power it is at a premium.\r\nHowever, while that was a smart strategic move, it wasn't enough to keep the stock climbing in April as it fell sharply after tariffs were announced. Chevron will continue to be sensitive to the health of the global economy and oil prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inUnitedHealth Group, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andUnitedHealth Groupwasn’t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.\r\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, described the 145% duty on China as so extreme that it essentially acts as an embargo rather than a conventional tariff.\r\n“We now have 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, a number that high frankly isn’t really a tariff. It’s more of an embargo. Almost nobody’s gonna pay that much of a markup. It’s a recipe for losing money.”\r\nREAD ALSO10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar RecentlyandJim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks\r\nCramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump’s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. “As a nation, shamefully, we’ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,” he said\r\n“I think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.”\r\nCramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. “Yes, we have to take them on now or never,” he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept.\r\n“So the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it’s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it’s not worth it to go back… [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I’m actually thinking that might be where we’\r\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.

      "title": "What Makes UnitedHealth Group (UNH) a Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ",
      "body": "Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\r\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\r\nBelow, we take a look atUnitedHealth Group (UNH), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\r\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. UnitedHealth Group currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\r\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\r\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for UNH that show why this largest U.S. health insurer shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\r\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\r\nFor UNH, shares are up 14.17% over the past week while the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry is up 1.21% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 22.68% compares favorably with the industry's 2.76% performance as well.\r\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of UnitedHealth Group have risen 17.6%, and are up 36.49% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved -7.64% and 4.64%, respectively."

      "body": "\r\nLet PharmaVoice’s free newsletter keep you informed on what industry leaders are saying, straight from your inbox.\r\n\r\nBrian Thompson’s murder has raised questions about the cost of U.S. healthcare, embroiling insurers, drugmakers and PBMs in a battle for the future of the industry.\r\nWhat started as the shocking murder of a healthcare executive has now become a watershed moment for an entire industry.\r\nBrian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was gunned down in December while walking along a Manhattan sidewalk. After an intense manhunt, the suspected assailant was caught and identified as Luigi Mangione.\r\nThe case against 26-year-old Mangione, which includes state and federal charges, is moving swiftly. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced earlier this month that the Justice Department willseek the death penaltyagainst Mangione, who allegedly wrote the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” on shell casings used in the murder of the health insurance executive. Mangione’s lawyers have since asked a federal judge toblock the DOJ’s attemptat capital punishment.\r\nAnd while Mangione’s courtroom drama unfolds, the slaying’s impact is still rippling through the healthcare industry, from payers to pharma.\r\nNews of the murder uncorked long-simmering outrage across the country over insurer profits and patients’ struggles to pay for healthcare. Scrutiny of UnitedHealth — the largest U.S. health insurance company — has quickly intensified.\r\nWith a market capitalization ofover $400 billion, UnitedHealth brings in as much revenue as the tech giant Apple.\r\nLaunched in the 1970s in Minnesota, the insurance companybuilt its empirethrough a string of deals that expanded its reach. Several large acquisitions deepened United’s investment into the Medicare coverage field. It also swallowed up several insurance competitors, bought hundreds of surgical sites, became a player in the home health industry and launched a pharmacy benefit manager called Optum Rx.\r\nThroughout its history, UnitedHealth has been embroiled in controversies that include antitrust suits and astock manipulation scandalin 2006 that led its CEO to resign.\r\nBefore Thompson was murdered, UnitedHealth was beinginvestigated by the DOJfor potential antitrust activities, and PBMs in general have beenunder a microscopefrom U.S. lawmakers over their role in drug pricing. Now, more revelations have turned the heat up on UnitedHealth’s business dealings in the fraught U.S. healthcare system.\r\nA range of policymakers and regulators are unpacking more about the company’s far-reaching business — and United is fighting back by blaming the pharma industry and other players in healthcare. Meanwhile, industry executives have been shoring up security as distrust and criticisms of the industry mount.\r\nThe killing of a chief executive shed light on the disparities inherent in a system that rewards corporate profit-seeking while leaving millions of patients unable to afford life-saving medications.\r\nKeep up with the story. Subscribe to the PharmaVoice free daily newsletter\r\nBefore Thompson’s assassination, UnitedHealth was raking in billions from price hikes from 2017 to 2022 on drugs for patients with conditions like heart disease and cancer, according to areportfrom the Federal Trade Commission.\r\nAlong with fellow PBMs Cigna and CVS Health, drug markups with percentages sometimes in the thousands drove revenue of $7.3 billion above what they paid for the drugs in the first place, the regulator said.\r\nInvestigators have found that these companies allegedly continue to pump up revenues through extralegal means. Anaudit in Tennesseerevealed that Cigna’s Express Scripts in 2023 mishandled transactions with pharmacies to keep from paying reimbursements.\r\nUnitedHealth has also raked in profit from government insurers like Medicare. Through Medicare Advantage, PBMs madeabout $33 billionin 2021 from coding diagnoses that exaggerated patients’ conditions to pull in more from the program, and UnitedHealth made up about half of those additional payments, according to a report in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\r\nIn response to the scrutiny, United hasn’t conceded much with its business model. Instead, the insurance giant has blamed the pharma industry.\r\nDuring the company’s end-of-year earnings call in January, UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty pointed to the high cost of drugs in the U.S. compared to other countries and specifically called out GLP-1 drugmakers, noting that “one drug whichcosts $900 in the U.S.costs about a tenth of that in Europe.” He also defended the role of Optum Rx in negotiating “many tens of billions of dollars in savings” for patients and passing through 98% of rebates directly to patients.\r\nBeyond drug prices, Witty said that hospitals benefit from higher costs for healthcare services. The comments came as the company declaredrecord revenues in 2024that topped $400 billion.\r\nIn the months since, United has made at least one notable change on the PBM side: Optum Rx willstop requiring reauthorizationsfor around 80 drugs. The move will eliminate some paperwork burdens for physicians and patients and cut about 10% of Optum’s prior authorizations, the PBM said in March.\r\nPrior authorizations, which require providers to receive approval from a patient’s insurance plan before providing a service or drug, are a majorsource of discontentamong providers and patients. UnitedHealthcare also said last month that it planned toreduce 10%of prior authorizations this year.\r\nWhile much of the public ire related to the Thompson murder has been directed at health insurers, a range of companies are investing in beefed up security for their top executives.\r\nOver 70% of companies across industries have security plans in place for their top leaders, according to a surveyconducted by HR Policy Associationreleased earlier this year. While 37% focus their security efforts solely on the CEO, nearly 70% provide protection for all C-suite executives, and most use third-party contractors. Over half of the 180 respondents to the survey said they are prioritizing security for travel and physical safety in 2025.\r\nIn pharma, the increased emphasis on safety was acutely felt at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco in January, which is one of the industry’s largest events of the year. The San Francisco Police Departmentadded barriersand checkpoints to the event’s main hub — the Westin St. Francis hotel — and canceled some officers’ days off to make sure the event was fully staffed.\r\nProxy statements released this year have also revealed just how much large pharmas are shelling out to protect their executives. About $960,000 of Moderna’sCEO pay packagefor Stéphane Bancel was used for security in 2024.\r\nPfizer spentmore than $661,000to protect CEO Albert Bourla, while Gilead Sciencesreportedmore than $285,000 in security services for CEO Daniel O’Day. In general,other large pharmas— including Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly — spent between $70,000 and $200,000 on CEO security last year.\r\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry leaders\r\nBrian Thompson’s murder has raised questions about the cost of U.S. healthcare, embroiling insurers, drugmakers and PBMs in a battle for the future of the industry.\r\nSubscribe to PharmaVoice for important stories, insights & perspectives\r\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry leaders\r\nBrian Thompson’s murder has raised questions about the cost of U.S. healthcare, embroiling insurers, drugmakers and PBMs in a battle for the future of the industry.\r\nThe free newsletter covering the top industry headlines\r\nFacing price negotiations, patent cliffs and trade tariffs, big pharma is refining its strategy.

If the sales are approved, UnitedHealth would only operate 10% of home health and 4% of hospice services in the U.S.\r\nStill, the offers have not proved sufficient for the DOJ, which has grown increasingly concerned about the size and influence of UnitedHealth — a company that operates one of the largest insurers in the nation, a major pharmacy benefit manager and a healthcare technology company, while employing thousands of physicians.\r\nThe DOJ is reportedly investigatingthe conglomerate for its potential anticompetitive effects, including the relationship between Optum and its insurer UnitedHealthcare.

      "title": "UnitedHealth Group (UNH)  One of the Best Dividend Paying Stock According to Hedge Funds",
      "body": "We recently published a list of the11 Best Dividend Paying Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other best dividend-paying stocks.\r\nDividend-paying stocks have consistently attracted investor interest due to their long-term value. CNBC highlights this by examining the historical performance of the broader market. Between 1960 and 2024, a $10,000 investment in the index would have grown to over $982,000 purely from stock price appreciation, based on data from FactSet and NYU Stern. However, many companies in the index also returned capital to shareholders through dividends. Had an investor reinvested those dividends over the years, the investment would have ballooned to approximately $6.42 million by the beginning of 2025.\r\nThis outlook seems reasonable, especially when considering how crucial cash flow has become in today’s economic environment. Investors continue to favor income-generating assets, and dividends remain one of the most reliable ways to deliver that income. Reflecting this trend, several companies within the market have recently introduced dividend payments.\r\nAccording to S&P Global, companies in the S&P index now contribute roughly 85% of the total dividends paid across the market—up from 82% in 2024. This increase includes 2.7% of the total dividend pool coming from firms that only recently began issuing dividends. The top 29 companies in the index alone are responsible for 40% of all dividends paid by the index’s constituents and 35% of the total dividends across the entire US equity market. Under the current base-case forecast, these leading firms are expected to distribute a combined $280 billion in dividends. In a more optimistic (upside) scenario, that figure could climb by 2.75% to $288 billion, with major large cap companies projected to deliver the most significant gains by weighted average. If the most favorable (bull-case) conditions materialize, these 29 companies could boost total dividend payouts by an estimated 4.5%, contributing an additional 1% themselves.\r\nIt’s no surprise, then, that dividends have become a central theme in many investors’ strategies. According to Brian Bollinger, founder of Simply Safe Dividends, focusing on companies that regularly pay dividends can offer a sense of reassurance. He further noted that younger investors, in particular, have the opportunity to build long-term dividend growth portfolios aimed at maximizing total return and capital appreciation over time."

As shown below, PGR and UNH shares have shown great relative strength in 2025.\r\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\r\nLet’s take a closer look at what to expect from each.\r\nUnitedHealth Group offers a full spectrum of health benefits, with its Optum segment using data and technology to improve care delivery and health outcomes.\r\nUNH is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the earnings estimate revisions trend for its upcoming release largely stable over recent months.

      "body": "We came across abullish thesison UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) on Substack by Oguz Erkan. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on UNH. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH)'s share was trading at $587.06 as of April 14th. UNH’s trailing and forward P/E were 37.85 and 19.72 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\r\nValeri Potapova/Shutterstock.com\r\nUnitedHealth Group stands as a powerful compounder in the healthcare space, benefiting from the defensive nature of health insurance—a category of spending that consumers prioritize even during economic downturns. In uncertain times, discretionary expenses like tech upgrades, dining out, and travel are often the first to go, but health insurance remains untouchable due to the catastrophic financial consequences of going uninsured. This dynamic gives health insurers, especially UnitedHealth, exceptional pricing power, allowing them to pass on rising costs without losing customers. UnitedHealth’s dominance is underpinned by its vertical integration, particularly through its health services arm, Optum, which continues to grow at a healthy clip above 10% annually. Despite recent concerns sparked by the tragic death of its insurance CEO and skepticism voiced by Bill Ackman regarding profitability, the company’s fundamentals remain unshaken. These events created temporary dislocations in the stock, which long-term believers used as buying opportunities. UnitedHealth’s revenue has compounded at 11% annually over the past five years, and despite modest net profit and return on equity margins at 5%, the consistency and resilience of its business model position it as a reliable performer in all market conditions. Its forward P/E of 20 reflects a fair valuation, especially considering the current environment. The stock has already gained 22% year-to-date, outperforming a declining S&P 500, and still presents a compelling opportunity for investors—particularly on any dip below the $550 level. For those seeking tariff-proof exposure with strong cost-passing capabilities and a resilient growth engine, UnitedHealth remains a top-tier choice. The combination of its indispensable service, stable financials, and strategic integration make it a long-term winner, regardless of market cycles.\r\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) is on our list of the30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 150 hedge fund portfolios held UNH at the end of the fourth quarter which was 112 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\r\nOn Friday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer outlined what investors should focus on in the week, especially pointing to earnings reports from major banks.\r\n“Rumor, innuendo, intrigue these are the stuff of great novels, of fabulous miniseries, riveting plays, and now they’re the stuff of the stock market.”\r\nREAD ALSO:Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocksand10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently.\r\nHe noted the chaotic nature of the current environment and remarked that “this tape has it all,” and emphasized how unpredictable developments from the White House have added to the turbulence. Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes.\r\n“Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,” he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, “Except this isn’t an eight-part blockbuster, it’s our money.” Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday’s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic.\r\nCramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a “liberation day bottom,” a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, “Not sure, I’m just not sure.” He added:\r\n“Have you ever noticed the weekends don’t provide relaxation anymore because the president’s got advisors? He’s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He’s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime…. Monday’s trading, well, let’s just say that it looks like that it’s earning season so it’s gonna be even harder than usual.”\r\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\r\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here)."

      "body": "Currently,CVS HealthCVS andUnitedHealth GroupUNH are two major vertically integrated behemoths in the U.S. healthcare market and key constituents of the S&P 500 index. Both companies have transformed beyond their original identities — CVS Health from a retail pharmacy chain into a healthcare powerhouse through its acquisition of Aetna and UnitedHealth from a traditional insurer into a tech-enabled care provider via its expansive Optum platform. Each now combines insurance, care delivery, pharmacy benefit management (PBM) and value-based service models to offer end-to-end healthcare solutions.\r\nFor investors, it is difficult to choose between the two, as both CVS and UnitedHealth continue to diversify their revenue streams and scale up their clinical and digital infrastructure. While they share structural similarities in business segmentation — insurance, health services, and pharmacy operations — their financial trajectories, operating margins, capital deployment strategies and risk exposures differ notably. Let’s examine which is the stronger buy right now.\r\nAfter a rough 2024, marked by high utilization at its Aetna insurance unit as well as reimbursement pressure, CVS Health has experienced a dramatic recovery so far in 2025. The stock has become the S&P 500’s top performer, with a year-to-date return of 56%, thereby outperforming all other index members by a significant margin. UnitedHealth, on the other hand, is at number 16 on the chart with a 16.5% gain. The stocks, however, outperformed the benchmark’s 8% dip during this period.\r\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\r\nAetna Margin Recovery and Cost Efficiencies in Focus:CVS Health is prioritizing margin recovery in its Aetna business, which posted 23% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter despite an adjusted operating loss. Favorable reserve developments and less severe-than-expected medical trends supported the performance. For 2025, CVS Health projects $132 billion in healthcare benefits revenues and at least $1.5 billion in adjusted operating income, with a 100-basis-point Medical Benefit Ratio improvement to 91.5%.\r\nWhile Medicare Advantage and individual exchange membership may decline, these are expected to be offset by growth in commercial self-insured plans and stronger plan design. The company is also executing a $2 billion multi-year cost efficiency initiative with 2025 savings expected to fully absorb rising variable expenses."

He suggested the administration was being careful not to hand over competitive advantages to Southeast Asian rivals, particularly Samsung:\r\n“So what I saw today, and not to be facetious, but what I see is people saying, you know what, we’ve seen the downside. Maybe we can test it again. But the president has, I don’t want to say blink, because that’s nonsense. What the president did was say, OK, look, we’re not going to continue to punish American companies and give the green light to Korea. I don’t know if you heard Lutnick’s words. He was very specific.

Instead, he argued that a softer dollar actually benefits American multinationals and gives long-needed relief to CFOs who’ve spent years blaming currency strength for lost market share:\r\n“Well, look, I’m not so certain I’m going to do a little contrary stuff on the dollar here. When we listen to conference calls, for the last four years, all we hear about is it would have been so much better if the dollar weren’t so strong. We keep losing share, the dollar’s too strong. Suddenly the dollar’s weaker, and now we start hearing all the downside, what, the bonds? I mean, I’m almost thinking that, I’m gonna put this out there, the people who are saying that it’s the end of the world, that the dollar is weaker, I think they have to go do some work boots on the ground. […] So suddenly the dollar’s weaker and we are petrified? These are people who have an agenda. And their agenda is to say, you know what matters more than anything else? Our hegemony from a strong dollar. And I don’t get it. If you’re in our business of picking stocks, you’re sick and tired of hearing CFOs say, we are done. We’ve got to stop this dollar rise.”"

Let’s take a closer look at each.\r\nColorado-based Newmont is one of the world's largest producers of gold, owning several active mines in Nevada, Peru, Australia, and Ghana. The surge in gold prices has been the driving factor behind the stock’s strong YTD performance, up nearly 50%.\r\nNotably, the average gold price per oz reached $2,643 throughout its latest period, melting higher from the $2,004 mark in the same period last year. Free cash flow of $1.6 billion throughout the period was the company’s highest read ever.\r\nBelow is a chart illustrating NEM’s free cash flow on a quarterly basis. The amplified cash-generating abilities are a huge positive, allowing the company to shell out dividend payments or pay down any debt.\r\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\r\nThe favorable gold environment has led analysts to up their EPS expectations across the board, with NEM now sporting a very bullish near-term outlook.\r\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\r\nUnitedHealth offers a full spectrum of health benefits, with its Optum segment using data and technology to improve care delivery and health outcomes. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its EPS outlook inching higher across nearly all timeframes over the past couple of months.\r\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\r\nIt’s critical to note that the company is scheduled to report quarterly results this week, with our current consensus expectations alluding to 5% YoY EPS growth on 11% higher sales. The company has been a stellar earnings performer overall, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate in each of its last 20 quarterly releases.\r\nIts results are expected on Thursday, April 17th, before the market’s open. Investors should also note that the company is largely shielded from any tariff worries thanks to its domestic operations within the U.S.\r\nSFM shares have been strong thanks to robust quarterly results, with the company exceeding both consensus EPS and sales expectations in each of its last ten quarters. Up nearly 160% over the last year, the stock has crushed the S&P 500.\r\nContinued sales growth has pleased investors, with SFM reporting double-digit percentage YoY sales growth rates in each of its last three periods. Sales of $2.0 billion throughout its latest period grew an impressive 17% from the year-ago mark, reflective of a strong demand picture overall."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\r\nOn Friday, Mad Money host, Jim Cramer, shared his perspective on how investors might approach the stock market given the current economic uncertainty.\r\n“You gotta make a list and decide what you can live with and what’s simply too dicey to buy. That my good friends, is how you have to think about stocks right now if you’re willing to be a slave to this crazy market in order to try to pocket what you can during this difficult period.”\r\nREAD ALSO:Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 15 Stocks to WatchandJim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks.\r\nCramer emphasized that before making any trading decision unless the plan is to hold it long-term and ride out near-term turbulence, investors should run what he described as a “gauntlet” of significant considerations. The first question he raised is whether the company in question does business in any foreign country. While it is common for investors to be cautious about China these days, Cramer pointed out that any nation could suddenly draw the ire of the U.S. president.\r\n“Now, it’s one thing to be worried about China, but it’s another to recognize that any country could at any time find itself on the president’s bad side. And once they get on his bad side, any American company doing real business there, finished.”\r\nCramer stressed the importance of avoiding companies that rely on international operations or resources. The second point on his checklist involved evaluating whether a company is cyclical, essentially, if it is vulnerable to swings in the broader economy. Highlighting the scale of the current trade friction, Cramer pointed out that the United States is effectively embargoing $439 billion worth of goods from China. He noted that it is likely to push inflation to levels not seen in a very long time. He added:\r\n“It’s hard to disagree with that assessment and I say that as someone who generally supports a trade crackdown on the Chinese government.”\r\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11.

Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2445093/energy-stocks-take-a-dive-values-or-traps\r\nWelcome to Episode #401 of the Value Investor Podcast.\r\n\r\n(0:15) - Can You Find Value In The Energy Industry or Are They Traps?\r\n(6:30) - Tracey Takes A Deep Dive Into 3 Stocks To Consider For Your Portfolio\r\n(32:20) - Episode Roundup: XOM, CVX, EOG\r\nPodcast@Zacks.com\r\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\r\nIn April 2025, after the Liberation Day tariffs were put into place by the United States, crude oil plunged. WTI traded down to $56 a barrel and has been gyrating between $55 and $65 ever since.\r\nWhile lower oil prices can mean good news for consumers at the pump, it’s bad news for the energy producers who are unhedged and have certain breakeven levels.\r\nThe oil and natural gas stocks have gotten hammered due to falling commodity prices and the uncertainty from the tariff turbulence of 2025. Although oil escaped direct American tariffs.\r\nEnergy companies are lumped into different categories within the oil industry. In this podcast, Tracey talks about “Big Oil” which are the large, integrated oil companies and the American explorers and producers, or the “E & Ps.”\r\nThe Integrated Oil stocks, as an industry, are down just 3.9% year-to-date. But the American E&Ps, as an industry, are now down 27.8% on the year.\r\nThe E&Ps, which do not have refining, chemicals, or other divisions to offset their production, are much more volatile when oil sells off.\r\nJust because a stock sells-off and now has a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, doesn’t mean that it’s a true value in the classical sense of the word.\r\nRemember, a true value stock is cheap on a P/E basis, but also has rising earning estimates.\r\nAre the energy stocks cheap, or just traps?\r\nExxon Mobil is a large American integrated oil company. Shares of Exxon are down 7.1% year-to-date but have finally started sinking in the last month, falling 10.6% in that time.\r\nExxon appears cheap with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.1. The 2025 Zacks Consensus Estimate is looking for $7.13 but that’s 8.5% under the $7.79 Exxon made last year. One earnings estimate has been revised higher for 2025 and 2 lower in the last week."

      "title": "Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM)  Among the Best Dividend Paying Stocks According to Hedge Funds",
      "body": "We recently published a list of the11 Best Dividend Paying Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best dividend-paying stocks.\r\nDividend-paying stocks have consistently attracted investor interest due to their long-term value. CNBC highlights this by examining the historical performance of the broader market. Between 1960 and 2024, a $10,000 investment in the index would have grown to over $982,000 purely from stock price appreciation, based on data from FactSet and NYU Stern. However, many companies in the index also returned capital to shareholders through dividends. Had an investor reinvested those dividends over the years, the investment would have ballooned to approximately $6.42 million by the beginning of 2025.\r\nThis outlook seems reasonable, especially when considering how crucial cash flow has become in today’s economic environment. Investors continue to favor income-generating assets, and dividends remain one of the most reliable ways to deliver that income. Reflecting this trend, several companies within the market have recently introduced dividend payments.\r\nAccording to S&P Global, companies in the S&P index now contribute roughly 85% of the total dividends paid across the market—up from 82% in 2024. This increase includes 2.7% of the total dividend pool coming from firms that only recently began issuing dividends. The top 29 companies in the index alone are responsible for 40% of all dividends paid by the index’s constituents and 35% of the total dividends across the entire US equity market. Under the current base-case forecast, these leading firms are expected to distribute a combined $280 billion in dividends. In a more optimistic (upside) scenario, that figure could climb by 2.75% to $288 billion, with major large cap companies projected to deliver the most significant gains by weighted average. If the most favorable (bull-case) conditions materialize, these 29 companies could boost total dividend payouts by an estimated 4.5%, contributing an additional 1% themselves.\r\nIt’s no surprise, then, that dividends have become a central theme in many investors’ strategies. According to Brian Bollinger, founder of Simply Safe Dividends, focusing on companies that regularly pay dividends can offer a sense of reassurance. He further noted that younger investors, in particular, have the opportunity to build long-term dividend growth portfolios aimed at maximizing total return and capital appreciation over time."

      "body": "In the latest market close, Exxon Mobil (XOM) reached $103.39, with a +0.24% movement compared to the previous day. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.79%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.78%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.64%.\r\nThe oil and natural gas company's stock has dropped by 7.83% in the past month, exceeding the Oils-Energy sector's loss of 8.15% and lagging the S&P 500's loss of 3.56%.\r\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Exxon Mobil in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on May 2, 2025. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.69, showcasing a 17.96% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $85.77 billion, indicating a 3.23% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\r\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $7.04 per share and a revenue of $348.38 billion, demonstrating changes of -9.63% and -0.34%, respectively, from the preceding year.\r\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Exxon Mobil. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\r\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\r\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 4.97% lower. Exxon Mobil is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\r\nLooking at its valuation, Exxon Mobil is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 14.66. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 7.56, so one might conclude that Exxon Mobil is trading at a premium comparatively.\r\nWe can also see that XOM currently has a PEG ratio of 2.93. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.13 as of yesterday's close."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best bargain stocks to buy in May.\r\nWhile increasing tariffs and a hard sell-off have resulted in uncertainty, Neuberger Berman, an investment manager, expects that negotiations can bring some relief to initial tariff proposals. Furthermore, the firm anticipates a sharply slower growth than a US recession. Also, it believes that stimulus in Europe and China can rejuvenate global industrial activity, and the firm recommends styles, sectors, and regions that are most geared to it.\r\nGiven that a significant amount of tariff shock has now been priced in, Neuberger Berman is constructive on global equities for the remainder of the year. The firm expects that an ongoing recovery in the global industrial economy might be dampened but not derailed. The underlying momentum in the goods economy is expected to support equities that are most levered to it. Furthermore, the firm prefers value over growth (which is relatively expensive) and small caps over large caps. While an overdose of growth-inhibiting policy can impact the relatively healthy economy and push it into recession, the investment management firm believes that the US hasn’t yet reached that point. As per the firm, performance during the decline demonstrates relative strength in some of the more cyclical economic sectors in the US and around the world. The goods-oriented sectors, regions, and styles continue to outperform amidst the recent sell-off.\r\nREAD ALSO:7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Termand8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\r\nS&P Global expects inflation to remain closer to 3.0% in 2025 as tariffs raise the prices along the domestic supply chain as well as for the end consumers. For 2026, the firm expects growth to pick up after a slow start. This is because of the abatement of uncertainty associated with the structure of tariffs and the further easing of the policy rate by the Federal Reserve. Also, the growth is expected to be aided partly because of a more favorable growth backdrop in the eurozone, which can help expand US exports.\r\nNeuberger Berman opines that a combination of improving fundamentals and stabilizing risks increased the optimism in the energy sector. As per the firm, increased global industrial activity is expected to continue to buoy oil demand and keep prices aloft. Furthermore, energy seems to be the most undervalued sector in the S&P 500 relative to the current and expected earnings growth. The investment management firm believes that much of the negative news, including regulatory concerns and geopolitical risks, seem to be factored in. This suggests that energy stocks can increase as the sentiment improves."

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\r\nKey Points\r\nLast week's rally in the broader stock market indexes sprung theNasdaq Composite(^IXIC-3.07%)back upward after a more than 20% that technically put it into a bear market. However, it's apparent that market volatility may be far from over.\r\nIncome investors looking at the current landscape may be wondering if now is the best time to buydividend stocksgiven the wild swings to the upside and the downside. Here are some risks worth considering before buying dividend stocks and whyExxonMobil(XOM1.04%)is a good example of a dividend stock that you can buy with confidence during a bear market.\r\nImage source: Getty Images.\r\nInvestors who use dividends for financial planning or to supplement income in retirement will want to target companies with reliable payouts. After all, what good is a dividend if a company cuts it at the slightest sign of economic uncertainty?\r\nExxonMobil has raised its dividend for42 consecutive years-- which may come as a surprise given the ups and downs in the oil and gas industry. In the last decade alone, there was the crash of 2014 and 2015 and the plunge during the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, ExxonMobil reported its worst year on record in 2020 -- a staggering $22.4 billion loss.\r\nEven during a period of high uncertainty and a collapse in the global economy, ExxonMobil kept its dividend streak alive in 2020 because it relied on the strength of its balance sheet.\r\nExxonMobil's balance sheet is in its best shape in over a decade.\r\nExxonMobil's net total long-term debt position is just $14.7 billion, which is small for a company of its size. Its financial debt-to-equity ratio of 0.08 and debt-to-capital ratio of 12.5% showcase how the company has reduced its dependence on debt and can rely on free cash flow to fund operating expenses and long-term investments.\r\nIn fact, ExxonMobil has the lowest debt-to-capital ratio of the major integrated U.S. and European oil and gas companies -- a close second being its U.S. peerChevron.\r\n\r\nBP Debt To Capital (Quarterly)data byYCharts\r\nExxonMobil can support its dividend even if margins fall due to lower oil and gas prices. The company has considerably improved its cost structure and technological advancements that havereduced production costs.\r\nExxonMobil has a long-term plan through 2030 built around Brent (the international benchmark) crude oil prices averaging $65 per barrel. However, it also has an optimistic scenario at $85 Brent and a pessimistic outcome at $55 per barrel. Even at $55 per barrel, ExxonMobil expects to earn acash surplus of $110 billion from 2025 to 2030thanks to higher free cash flow from its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, development of onshore assets in the Permian Basin, production expansion offshore Guyana, and other moves.\r\nBrent crude oil prices averaged $81 per barrel in 2024 but have fallen in recent weeks due to tariff tensions, production increases in the Middle East, and recession fears. Brent crude oil is at a three-year low of around $63.60 at the time of this writing. But again, even at this level, the dividend is manageable -- although ExxonMobil may pull back on near-term capital expenditures if prices stay low.\r\nThe third risk worth considering before scooping up shares of dividend stocks during a bear market is whether the company can endure a prolonged slowdown. Or, in this case, tariffs.\r\nDividend affordability and a strong balance sheet are part of the equation, but so are competitive advantages. ExxonMobil can profit from its oil and gas production portfolio even at lower prices. Unlike some pure-play companies, ExxonMobil isn't dependent on a single geographic region. ExxonMobil also has a massive refining business and a growing low-carbon division. So, in the event of a slowdown, the company should bewell positioned to take market shareor even pounce on an acquisition opportunity.\r\nNot all dividend-paying companies have ExxonMobil's advantages. Some companies had strained balance sheets heading into 2025. Others have a dividend expense that is alreadyeating up the bulk of profits. So, for these companies, if profits come down and stay down for too long, there could be pressure for a dividend cut.\r\nDividends are an excellent way to collect passive income no matter what stock prices are doing -- allowing investors to book a return without having to sell stock. But a dividend is only as reliable as the company paying it.\r\nDespite operating in the cyclical oil and gas industry, ExxonMobil is a beacon of dividend reliability. With a yield of 4%, ExxonMobil is an excellent way to generate a sizable amount of passive income while staying invested in the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inExxonMobil, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andExxonMobilwasn’t one of them.

Meanwhile,JPMorganis even more bearish. Its recession model sees a nearly 80% chance the economy goes into a recession, up from 60% not long ago.\r\nRecessions tend to cause corporate profits to decline, which drives many companies to cut costs through layoffs and other initiatives. Some companies will even cut or suspend theirdividend paymentsto shareholders to conserve cash.\r\nHowever, other companies are more recession-resistant due to the durability of their cash flows and the strength of their balance sheets.ExxonMobil(XOM1.04%)andCoca-Cola(KO-0.19%)have proven their ability to weather recessions over the decades. They've both increased their dividends throughout at least the past four recessions. There's a good chance they can withstand the next one with similar ease.\r\n\r\nXOM Dividenddata byYCharts. Gray bars are recessions.\r\nExxonMobil hiked its dividend payment by 4% earlier this year, extending its streak to 42 years of annual payment increases. \"We're proudof the factthat we've increased our annual dividend per share for 42 years in a row, something only 4% ofS&P 500companies can claim,\" stated CFO Kathy Mikells during the oil giant's fourth-quarter earnings conference call. She continued, \"And we plan for that track record to continue for decadesto come, which is only possible by investing in the high-quality growthopportunities that drive leading returns and higher cash flows.\"\r\nThe energy company has been investing heavily in transforming its business to dramatically improve its underlying earnings power whilealsoexpanding into lower-carbon energy. This strategy has boosted its earnings capacity by nearly $14 billion over the past five years on a constant price and margin basis. Exxon plans to invest over $140 billion into major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program through 2030, which, along with structural cost savings, should add another $20 billion to its annual earnings capacity.\r\nThat incremental income will give Exxon even more fuel to grow its dividend, which is already on an incredibly safe foundation. Last year,Exxon produced $34.4 billion in free cash flow, easily covering its $16.7 billion dividend outlay. Meanwhile, it has a fortress balance sheet with an ultra-low 6%leverage ratioand a massive $23.2 billion cash balance. These factors put the oil giant's 3.8%-yielding dividend on a rock-solid foundation that should continue withstanding recessions.\r\nCoca-Cola boosted its dividend payment by 5.2% earlier this year. That extended its dividend growth streak to 63 straight years. That raise kept Coca-Cola in the ultra-elite group ofDividend Kings, companies with 50 or more years of annual dividend increases.\r\nThe company has benefited from the durable and growing demand for its beverage brands. Its portfolio features multiple billion-dollar brands that generate lots of free cash flow for the company. Coca-Cola expects to produce $9.5 billion in free cash flow this year, more than enough to cover its dividend outlay ($8.4 billion last year). The company also has a strong cash-rich balance sheet ($12.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments) with leverage at the low end of its target range.\r\nCoca-Cola's long-term target is to organically grow its revenue by 4%-6% annually, which should drive mid-to-high single-digit earnings-per-share growth. Meanwhile, the company can enhance its growth rate by making accretive acquisitions. That puts it in a strong position to continue increasing its2.9%-yieldingdividend.\r\nExxon and Coca-Cola have increased their dividendsevery yearfor several decades,which includesthe last four recessions.They're in excellent positions to continue raising their payout during the next downturn, whetherthat happenslater this year orfurtherin the future.Because of that, they're great dividend stocks to buy for a durable passive income stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you buy stock inExxonMobil, consider this:\r\nThe Motley FoolStock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… andExxonMobilwasn’t one of them.

      "body": "We recently published a list of the11 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other undervalued energy stocks.\r\nOn March 18, Tortoise Capital senior portfolio manager Rob Thummel appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ to discuss his outlook on the energy sector. He believes that natural gas is positioned to lead growth in the future within the energy sector. This natural gas demand is driven by electricity and energy exports. Thummel noted that the energy and tech sectors are converging due to advancements like AI and data centers. Electricity demand fuels natural gas consumption, while US energy exports help meet global needs for low-cost and low-carbon energy. He also highlighted that the US is now emerging as the largest exporter of LNG, even though it was an LNG importer just years ago. He anticipates that the US LNG exports will soon 2x in volume over time. Thummel also expects Europe and other countries to prioritize energy security and diversify their supply sources. This will ensure reliance on US energy exports.\r\nThummel emphasized a focus on energy infrastructure companies while discussing his specific investment strategies as they tend to be stable and have high dividend yields even in uncertain market conditions. He thinks that the certainty provided by energy infrastructure investments in an otherwise volatile market should not be neglected. Such companies generate substantial annual cash flows while maintaining disciplined financial practices.\r\nThummel thinks that the energy sector trades at a discount to historical valuations despite its fundamentals. This offers the potential for high returns.\r\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top energy stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15 as of April 10. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers.\r\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here)."

      "body": "We are yet to get first-quarter 2025 results from the energy companies, with the oil-energy sector’s earnings season to start this week. In the meantime,Exxon Mobil CorporationXOM has already offered an early glimpse of how the quarter might have shaped up. As oil and natural gas prices were buoyant in the March quarter, we expectBP plcBP andSLBSLB to beat on first-quarter earnings.\r\nPer the data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), the average Cushing, OK WTI spot prices for January, February, and March of this year were $75.74, $71.53 and $68.24 per barrel, respectively. Thus, the overall pricing environment was favorable in the first quarter of 2025, as the breakeven costs of the exploration and production companies in the shale plays are significantly lower.\r\nHowever, although crude prices were advantageous in the March quarter of this year, the overall prices of the commodity were a bit higher at $74.15, $77.25 and $81.28 per barrel in January, February and March of 2024, respectively. Hence, the oil-energy sector is likely to have generated lower total earnings in the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the prior-year quarter.\r\nOur data suggests that in the March quarter of 2025, the sector will probably generate total earnings of $27.5 billion, lower than $30.5 billion in the first quarter of 2024.\r\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\r\nNotably, the pricing scenario for natural gas was not only healthier but also favorable in the first quarter of 2025.\r\nSince the prices of both crude oil and natural gas were favorable for exploration and production activities, upstream energy players will likely report handsome first-quarter results. Oilfield service players will also likely remain in the sweet spot since they help upstream firms set up oil and gas wells effectively.\r\nXOM, one of the largest integrated energy players, recently reported in an SEC filing that it expects its upstream earnings for the March quarter to increase sequentially by as much as $800 million. The company attributed advantageous oil and gas prices for the improvement. Moreover, ExxonMobil expects its Energy Products business unit to witness a sequential improvement of $300-$700 million owing to the changes in industry margins.\r\nWith the existence of a number of players in the sector, finding the right energy stocks that have the potential to beat on earnings can be daunting. Our proprietary methodology, however, makes it fairly simple."

      "body": "Exxon Mobil CorporationXOM, the U.S. oil and gas giant, has failed to find commercially feasible natural gas reserves at an exploratory well, namely Elektra-1, which was drilled offshore Cyprus earlier this year. Earlier, XOM had mentioned that it collected extensive three-dimensional (3D) seismic data and discovered several large prospects offshore Cyprus, including the Electra prospect. Based on the evaluation of the seismic data, the company stated that the Electra prospect was promising.\r\nThe U.S. energy major recently completed drilling activities at the Elektra-1 well. The Ministry of Energy, Commerce and Industry in Cyprus noted that preliminary assessments and the data collected from the exploratory well indicated that the gas reserves at the prospect were commercially infeasible for development. However, the ministry also noted that XOM’s initial assessments, following the drilling operations, have shown promising results. The initial results of the evaluation confirm the presence of a hydrocarbon system alongside high-quality reservoirs.\r\nThe drilling operations at the Electra prospect were conducted by a consortium comprising ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Cyprus, and QatarEnergy International E&P LLC, with the former acting as the operator. The Elektra-1 well was drilled in Block 5 of the Exclusive Economic Zone (“EEZ”) in Cyprus. ExxonMobil holds exploration licenses in two offshore blocks in Cyprus, with QatarEnergy as its partner.\r\nThe country's energy ministry has stated that the information collected while conducting drilling operations will be analyzed further and considered by the consortium before determining its future plans in Block 5. The consortium will now focus on drilling another exploratory well, Pegasus-1, located in a different offshore block in Cyrus’ EEZ.\r\nThe results pose a major setback for Cyprus as the country is yet to produce natural gas from its offshore discoveries. Cyprus is trying to secure its position as an alternative natural gas supplier to the European Union (EU). After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, many European nations are trying to diversify their gas supply sources, and the Mediterranean region has attracted significant attention due to its offshore gas reserves. However, the initial assessment of the Elektra-1 well has dealt a blow to Cyprus’ ambitions to establish itself as an alternative supplier and contribute to the EU’s energy security."

      "body": "We recently published a list of the10 Best Oil Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best oil stocks.\r\nAfter an encouraging start to the year, the energy sector is once again lagging behind the overall market. At the time of writing this piece, the broader energy sector has slid by almost 8.2% since the beginning of 2025, against declines of around 7.9% by the wider market. The principal reason behind this fall is the decline in the global prices of oil, which have plunged by almost 14.5% since the beginning of the year.\r\nREAD NEXT:10 Best Clean Energy Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires\r\nThe continued uncertainty surrounding the ongoing tariff war and the recent decision by OPEC+ to increase supply in May have taken a toll on the global price, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price now hovering around a 3-year low of $61.5. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecasted WTI price to average $63.88 per barrel for 2025 before dropping to an average of $57.48 next year. Such a sharp decline in prices could threaten US oil production growth this year. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the US oil industry needs prices between $61 and $70 per barrel to be profitable.\r\nThe escalating trade tensions between the US and China have also raised the prospect of a global economic slowdown, potentially leading to a lower-than-forecasted consumption of oil. In its latest report, the EIA now expects global oil consumption to increase by 900,000 b/d in 2025 and 1 million b/d in 2026, down by 400,000 b/d and 100,000 b/d, respectively, from its initial forecast last month. The decrease in demand, coupled with increasing production, will continue putting pressure on crude prices, forcing many industry players to cut back activity to maintain investor payouts.\r\nThe American oil and gas sector is also frustrated by the back and forth trade policies of President Trump and is questioning how they align with his ‘drill, baby, drill’ mandate to further boost production. According to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, nearly a third of oil executives have stated that their business outlook has worsened since the end of 2024. Moreover, the imposition of the 25% tariff on steel and aluminum has already led to an estimated 4% increase in costs for drilling a well.\r\nThe pressing issues surrounding the global oil trade have forced the industry to shift focus to its second major source of revenue – natural gas. In contrast to oil, the benchmark US natural gas price at Henry Hub has surged by more than 123% since last year and by almost 18% since the beginning of 2025. The uptick comes as a result of slowing output in 2024, booming LNG exports, and fast-depleting inventories during the coldest winter in six years. Moreover, natural gas has emerged as a leading candidate to power the ongoing AI boom and its accompanying data centers, with many providers now even aiming to surpass utilities and supply directly to these power-hungry facilities."

Like Block(formerly Square) in the United States, STNE’s technology empowers businesses to accept credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallet payments through its point-of-sale payment solution.\r\n2. Banking Services:StoneCo is much more than a payment processor. Small and medium-sized businesses can use STNE to bank, pay bills, and manage accounts. In addition, because STNE collects transaction data, the company can utilize that data to assess a client’s creditworthiness and offer loans.\r\n3. Software Tools:Like Canadian e-commerce leaderShopify (SHOP),STNE offers a full suite of products that allow businesses to seamlessly conduct e-commerce transactions, analyze their client base, and manage customers.\r\nStone allows investors to harness the growth of a largely untapped and rapidly growing Brazilian payments market. Brazil is the world’s ninth-largest economy and boasts the largest economy in Latin America, with more than $2 trillion in annual GDP. In Brazil, retail sales are growing, the middle class encompasses roughly 60% of the population, and the country is modernizing into a digital economy.\r\nUnlike the United States, Brazil’s digital payment economy is unsaturated, with roughly only 15% of consumers using digital payments currently. However, Statista predicts that, from 2025 to 2029, the Brazilian digital payment market will register a ~29% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and grow from ~$300 billion to ~$900 billion.\r\nStoneCO has consistently delivered EPS results above Wall Street expectations. The company has outpaced Zacks Consensus Estimates in twelve of the past thirteen quarters. Last quarter, despite a difficult and uncertain macroeconomic environment, STNE beat Wall Street’s top-and-bottom-line expectations. A positive EPS surprise of 21.88% last quarter suggests that STNE’s business is gaining momentum."

      "title": "Petrobras' Environmental Hurdles Lead to Oil Blocks Auction in Brazil",
      "body": "Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. – Petrobras’PBR years-long disputes with the environmental authorities on drilling licenses recently led to an oil block auction, whereby Brazil’s oil regulator, ANP, will provide exploration rights in several offshore oil blocks.\r\nThe auction, which is scheduled to take place on June 17, will offer 172 blocks spanning both land and deep-water zones in northeastern and southern Brazil, including the Equatorial Margin — a region that could be key to Brazil’s energy future. The blocks across five sedimentary basins, including the deepwater Potiguar and Foz do Amazonas, located near the equator, will also be offered, which are considered to hold Brazil’s greatest potential for replenishing reserves and are projected to start declining by 2030.\r\nOut of the 172 oil blocks, 47 are at the Foz do Amazonas, where Petrobras, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold),won the exploration deal in 2023 and since then, has been awaiting environmental clearance to drill its first well. These oil blocks are expected to contain the same potential as those in Suriname and Guyana, where Exxon Mobil found billions of barrels of oil. The delay in environmental clearance certainly reduces the attractiveness of these blocks for the auction.\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\nCertain environmental working groups have suggested dropping some Potiguar Basin oil blocks, like Atol das Rocas and the Fernando de Noronha archipelago as they are in places of extreme environmental sensitivity and ecosystem connectivity.\r\nHowever, Brazil’s several ministries jointly allowed these sensitive areas to be offered for auction, even though this authorization expires just a day after the auction. This puts the Potiguar Basin at particular risk of exclusion from future rounds.\r\nDespite the controversies, the auction has attracted interest from the industry’s big players. Thirty-one companies have registered themselves to bid for the upcoming auction, including Petrobras,Exxon Mobil CorporationXOM,Chevron CorporationCVX,BP p.l.c.BP,Shell and Equinor.\r\nExxon Mobil is a U.S.-based oil and gas giant that has a track record of optimal capital structure and Capex discipline across the commodity price cycle, making it a low-risk energy player producing industry-leading returns. XOM’s expected growth rate for earnings per share for the next year is 21.88%, which aligns favorably with the industry growth rate of 16.30%."

      "body": "Exxon Mobil CorporationXOM is moving closer to expanding its oil output in Guyana, as its fourth floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel, One Guyana, begins the installation process offshore. This initiative, confirmed by Guyana’s maritime authority earlier this week, marks a significant step toward the rapid development of the country’s prolific Stabroek Block.\r\nBuilt by SBM Offshore, the One Guyana FPSO has a production capacity of 250,000 barrels per day. It departed Singapore in mid-February and reached Guyanese waters this week. Once operational, the vessel is expected to help push the consortium’s total production capacity to around 940,000 barrels per day by the end of 2025.\r\nThe FPSO will support the development of ExxonMobil's Yellowtail and Redtail fields, both located within the giant Stabroek Block. With over 11 billion barrels of recoverable resources discovered, the block has become one of the most significant offshore oil finds in recent history.\r\nAfter recent upgrades, the company produced an average of 616,000 barrels per day from its three operational FPSOs in 2024. The addition of One Guyana marks a significant step toward boosting that number.\r\nExxonMobil confirmed the vessel's arrival in a recent statement, noting that production from the Yellowtail project is expected to commence later this year, once installation and well work are complete. According to shipping data, One Guyana is currently positioned near Exxon’s three active FPSOs in Guyanese waters.\r\nWith two more FPSOs scheduled to arrive over the next two years, ExxonMobil is signaling continued confidence in Guyana's role as a key pillar of its upstream growth strategy. The rapid deployment of infrastructure and consistent production ramp-ups suggest that the South American nation is poised to become a major player in global oil markets, with ExxonMobil at the helm.Top of Form\r\nBottom of Form\r\nExxonMobil currently carries a Zack Rank #4 (Sell).\r\nInvestors interested in the energy sector may look at some better-ranked stocks likeArchrock Inc.AROC,Delek Logistics Partners, LPDKL andKinder Morgan, Inc.KMI.

      "title": "Chevron or ExxonMobil  Which Big Oil Leads the Permian Charge ",
      "body": "ChevronCVX andExxonMobilXOM are two of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. The Permian Basin has become a linchpin for both as they sharpen their focus on scalable, high-return assets. Each company is doubling down on this prolific region serving as a key source of cash flow, but their paths diverge in strategy and execution.\r\nAccording to the Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), U.S. crude oil production, largely driven by the Permian, is expected to reach 13.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2025 and 13.6 million bpd in 2026. With Permian output set to grow by 290,000 bpd this year from 2024 and an additional 170,000 bpd in 2026, the region will account for nearly half of the nation’s oil supply, solidifying its role in the energy market. This surge in production is backed by record-breaking rig efficiency, robust infrastructure and continued investments in drilling innovations, ensuring long-term sustainability and profitability for key players in the basin.\r\nChevron holds 1.78 million net acres in the Delaware and Midland sub-basins of Texas and New Mexico, making it one of the largest leaseholders in the Permian. It boosts efficiency by drilling several horizontal wells from a single site, a method known as factory-style development. In 2024, Chevron’s average daily output from the Permian basin stood at 405,000 barrels of oil, 251,000 barrels of NGLs, and 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas.Chevron aims to reach 1 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (BOE/d) in 2025 and is already close, producing 992,000 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2024. With layered rock formations, upgraded infrastructure, and sustainability steps like using electric fleets and solar energy, Chevron’s strategy focuses on both growth and reducing environmental impact.Meanwhile, ExxonMobil has aggressively ramped up its Permian presence through acquisitions — most notably its $63 billion buyout of Pioneer Natural Resources in 2024. This move expanded Exxon’s footprint to more than 1.3 million net acres and significantly boosted output. In 2024, ExxonMobil’s Permian production averaged 1.185 million BOE/d, up 570,000 from the prior year. The company plans to double that to 2.3 million BOE/d by 2030. To get there, it’s using advanced methods like special proppants and cube drilling, and it aims to cut emissions to net zero in its original Permian operations by 2030 and in Pioneer’s by 2035."

      "title": "Is Exxon Mobil (XOM) Among The Top Goldman Sachs Value Stocks ",
      "body": "We recently published a list ofGoldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other Goldman Sachs value stocks to invest in.\r\nAs we recentlydiscussedin another article, growth stocks are massively overvalued and trading at significant premiums, which is why investment firms advise investors to concentrate on value stocks. Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.\r\nSo, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.\r\nWarren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’sBerkshirepicks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.\r\nOverall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio.\r\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\r\nTo compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value."
