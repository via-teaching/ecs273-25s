The ban will apply to all existing orders from the US manufacturing giant, while Beijing has also told the country’s carriers not to buy any aircraft-related equipment or parts from other American companies.Trump hit back against the Chinese intervention on social media, saying that Beijing had “reneged” on deals for what he called “fully committed to aircraft.” Boeing’s shares slumped as much as 4.5pc in premarket trading following the reports but later recovered most of these losses. The company declined to comment. It comes afterChina imposed 125pc tariffs on US-manufactured goods, which more than doubled the cost of Boeing planes and made it impractical for airlines to buy them, according to Bloomberg. It is the latest move in the tit-for-tat trade war between the US and China, which has seen Washington impose tariffs as high as 145pc on Chinese goods. Boeing has been caught in the middle of the clash, losing access to one of the world’s biggest aviation markets in the process. While Airbus has dominated Western airliner exports to China in recent years, the world’s second biggest economy remains a vital market for Boeing and had been forecast to make up 20pc of global demand over the next two decades.Airbus forecasts that China will have more than 11,000 aircraft in service by 2043, of which 9,500 will be new deliveries. It is also not the first time thatBoeing has been a source of tension between Washington and Beijing, as China was the first country to ground the 737 Max jet following two fatal crashes in 2019. It was also one of the last to allow the plane to re-enter service, which led some Chinese airlines to abandon orders. The standoff highlights China’s lingering dependence on imported planes despite its attempts to build up its own aerospace industry. The C919, a rival to the 737 developed bylocal plane-maker Comac, has won only a handful of export deals.Boeing has what it calls a completion and delivery centre in China but no actual production line there. That is in contrast to Airbus, which operates two final assembly lines for narrow-body jets in the city of Tianjin, 70 miles from Beijing. Currently, around 10 Boeing 737s are preparing to enter Chinese airline fleets, based on data from Aviation Flights Group, with some waiting at Boeing’s manufacturing base in Seattle and others at the firm’s completion and delivery centre in eastern China. Paperwork and payments for some of the jets may have been completed before China’s reciprocal tariffs took effect on April 12, Bloomberg reported, meaning they could still be delivered. The Chinese government is also considering ways to provide assistance to airlines that lease Boeing jets and are facing higher costs, it said.China’s top three airlines – Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines – had planned to take delivery of 45, 53 and 81 Boeing planes respectively between 2025 and 2027. Trump announced a Chinese order for 300 Boeing aircraft worth $37bn (£28bn) at a signing ceremony with President Xi Jinping during his first term in 2017, only for the bulk of the deal to be revealed to consist of earlier agreements, some dating back to 2013. China tends to order jets through a centralised buyer before dividing them up between carriers. Such accords are often tentative, leaving the final purchases particularly prone to changes or cancellation. They also mean that Boeing may have been counting on shipping hundreds more planes to China not yet officially recorded as orders on its books. Meanwhile, the broaderimpact of tariffs on the aerospace industryremains confused. Airlines in both the US and Europe have indicated that they intend to defer deliveries should Washington impose levies on planes, but Mr Trump has so far failed to make clear whether that will be the case. The boss of Delta Air Lines said last week that the carrier would not pay any tariffs that might become applicable on upcoming Airbus deliveries, and would instead delay taking the planes. Michael O’Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, one of the world’s biggest customers for Boeing planes, said he would also probably defer deliveries from the US company if they were to become more expensive. Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday called on his country and Vietnam to "oppose unilateral bullying", Beijing's state media reported, during a regional tour as leaders confront US tariffs.Xi told Lam their two countries must "jointly oppose unilateral bullying, and uphold the stability of the global free trade system as well as industrial and supply chains," according to the Xinhua news agency. European Commission may reportedly let companies declare force majeure as part of strategy to rid bloc of Russian fossil fuels by 2027 UK retail bosses have warned that Trump’s tariffs will cause low-quality goods to be dumped into Europe from China via distributor sites like Amazon. Unable to sell competitively in the US due to US President Donald Trump’s 104 per cent tariffs on goods from China, as well as his decision to end the de minimis Chinese factories are mocking Donald Trump’s attempts to punish Beijing with tariffs by encouraging American shoppers to buy direct from “the world’s factory” at knockdown prices. Energy watchdog cuts forecast for growth in demand by a third, and says a trade war could mean it falls further The tussle over British Steel has laid bare just how exposed UK industry is to foreign influence. China is seeking to position itself as a pillar of stability as US President Donald Trump continues to spook investors with tariff plans.View on euronews China has instructed its airlines to stop taking deliveries from Boeing, in the latest twist in the country’s fast-moving trade war with the US. Sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that officials had also requested Chinese carriers halt purchases of any aircraft-related equipment and parts from US companies. Donald Trump has imposed tariffs as Global sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles rose 29% year-on-year in March, helped by growth in China and Europe, while EV growth in North America was hampered by U.S. President Donald Trump's stance towards emissions standards and uncertainties around tariffs, data showed on Tuesday.  U.S. tariffs on car imports may force some of the country's automakers which produce in neighbouring Mexico to readjust prices, or move their production, Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester said.  Chinese counter-tariffs, meanwhile, could affect Tesla's U.S.-made models, leading to an almost doubling in prices of its Model S and Model X cars sold in China, Lester said. MILAN (Reuters) -Stellantis Chairman John Elkann said on Tuesday U.S. tariffs and strict European Union emissions standards were threatening the industry, as the automaker continued its search for a new chief executive.  "With the current path of painful tariffs and overly rigid regulations, the American and European car industries are being put at risk," amid increased competition from China, Elkann said at the group's annual shareholders' meeting.  "That would be a tragedy as car manufacturing is a source of jobs, innovation and strong communities," he said.
