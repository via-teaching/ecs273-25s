Johnson & Johnson stock slipped on Tuesday, even after the company reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, and boosted its full-year sales forecast.

Johnson & Johnson stock fell alongside the broader market, despite beating first-quarter calls and hiking its 2025 sales guidance. Johnson & Johnson forecasts about $400 million in costs this year related to tariffs on medical devices, said Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk in an interview.  Wolk said the estimated costs represent a "worst-case scenario" and take into account President Trump’s 90-day pause, China's retaliatory tariffs and the resumption of the U.S. tariffs.  J&J isn't doing anything differently yet in response to tariffs, Wolk added. ConocoPhillips (COP) closed at $86.45 in the latest trading session, marking a +0.07% move from the prior day.
