In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against other best golf stocks to buy according to analysts.\nGolf stocks are publicly traded firms that are part of the golf industry. These companies include businesses that manufacture golf equipment, operate golf courses, and provide associated services, giving investors a chance to engage in the golf market.\nThe golf industry continues to evolve with women, social play, lessons, and online bookings driving key developments. According to a report by NBC Sports Next, female engagement has grown by 15%, with 800,000 more women golfers joining between 2020 and 2022, compared to a 2% rise among male golfers. Women now account for one-third of junior players and 49% of surveyed golfers. Golf remains a strongly social activity, with 49% of surveyed golfers primarily playing with friends. Business-related golf is also growing, notably among GolfNow users. While 36% of golfers took a lesson in the previous year, the number rose to 67% among GolfNow customers, with many preferring a combination of on-course and facility-based training. Moreover, younger golfers are frequently booking online, with 43% of those aged 18 to 34 reserving at least one round by 2023. Speed and convenience are essential, with 55% citing online booking as the quickest option. These developments point out expansion prospects for courses that cater to women, social golfers, and digitally aware players.\nAccording to the National Golf Foundation’s research, the golf business in the United States is still expanding rapidly, with 45 million Americans (aged 6 and up) playing golf in 2023, including 26.6 million on-course and 18.4 million in off-course venues like simulators and Topgolf. The business has seen nearly 2 million new golfers each year for the past ten years, with 3.4 million first-time players projected in 2023 alone. The largest consumer age group is still young adults (18-34 years old), with 6.3 million participants on the course and 5.8 million off. Since 2019, juniors (3.5 million) have shot up by 40%, with girls accounting for 37%. Female involvement has climbed to 7 million, making up 26% of on-course golfers. In 2023, rounds played reached a record high of 531 million, beating the pre-pandemic average by more than 10%. The US offers 16,000 courses at 14,000 facilities, with 75% open to the public. Despite a 12% drop in course supply since 2006, demand remains high, with 22.4 million people expressing a desire to play.\nFinally, TGL, the golf league that began playing matches in January 2025, is combining digital and physical components to create an entirely new hybrid golf experience. Teams of golfers compete in a specially created venue across a set of custom-made holes. They begin by hitting a large-screen simulator of real terrain, then shift to a transformable turntable as the green. Broadcasting innovations aimed at bringing golfers’ experiences closer to home viewers were deemed crucial from the start. The 2025 PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando showcased the golf industry’s strong momentum.\nMarc Simon, Vice President of PGA Golf Exhibitions, stated:\n“The show is a reflection of the industry, and golf is thriving right now,” “With the surging popularity of golf, we saw the largest number of exhibitors and largest occupied space since 2009, which is encouraging to see.”\nThe exhibition included over 1,000 exhibitors spread across 1.1 million square feet, showcasing golf’s continuous development in the $102 billion industry. More than 1,200 VIP buyers from 770 golf courses and mass merchandisers attended, totaling $810 million in purchasing power and roughly $2 billion in retail sales potential. The event has progressed beyond typical golf equipment and gear to include fitness, health, and wellness areas, as well as racquet sports and club facilities. The Clubhouse exhibition space was doubled in size, mirroring the trend in golf facilities toward broader member experiences.\nTechnology was a major focus, with AI-powered golf simulators, effective ball-flight data, and next-generation golf carts catering to growing personal cart ownership. Golf’s trends are shifting, with a record 200 influencers in attendance and robust clothing growth fueled by Gen Z consumers. The PGA Show’s reinvention is in line with industry trends, stressing experiential marketing and innovation. Looking ahead, organizers intend to continue responding to changing company needs in order to ensure long-term industry success.\nA team of trainers and athletes displaying a wide range of athletic and casual footwear.\nFor this list, we compiled an initial list of 12 golf stocks, which included companies that are involved in the golf industry. Then, we selected the 10 stocks that had the highest upside potential as of April 9, 2025. We have only included stocks in our list with an upside potential of 10% or higher. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the upside potential.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nAnalysts’ Upside Potential as of April 9: 52.04%\nNIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is among the Best Golf Stocks. It is a global athletic clothing and footwear corporation. While it is not a large player in the golf equipment market, it does provide a diverse line of golf clothes and footwear, including shoes and clothing tailored for comfort and style on the course. Its golf products are connected with well-known golfers such as Rory McIlroy and have received widespread recognition for their quality and performance attributes. However, other sports, such as basketball, jogging, and soccer, continue to receive wide attention.\nThe company’s business in China, a vital market, has struggled due to the economic downturn and increased competition from local businesses. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)’s CEO, Elliott Hill, focuses on restoring the brand’s core identity: sport and the athlete, with a particular focus on rebuilding relationships with retailers and promoting innovation.\nThe business aims to reconnect with players and sports fans by highlighting the brand’s genuine connection to the sport. It intends to relaunch its product lineup through innovation, ensuring that its offerings are not only in line with present trends but also far ahead of the curve in terms of performance and design. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) introduced several new items, including the Peg Premium and Vomero 18, which gained excellent consumer feedback. The new 24/7 apparel collection outperformed sales projections, showing successful footwear and apparel innovation.\nHill admits that NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has relied too heavily on promotions to drive sales and intends to transition to a full-price model in its online business while actively eliminating outdated inventory through less profitable channels.\nOverall, NKE ranks 2nd on our list of the 10 best golf stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of golf companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nTariffs are rattling markets and leading to spikes in volatility. Growth-focused sectors like technology and consumer discretionary are particularly vulnerable given their cyclicality and global exposure.\nApple (AAPL -3.82%) and Nike (NKE -2.14%) are down over 20% year to date at the time of this writing, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, which are also down significantly. Here's why both stocks are selling off and whether they are worth buying now.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThere's no sugarcoating Apple's exposure to tariffs, especially in China. China is a key market for Apple -- both from a manufacturing and a sales perspective.\nAfter Apple stock surged on April 9 in response to a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs to all countries except China, it sank 4% the following day on news that the tariff rate on Chinese goods would be raised to a staggering 145%. If it sticks, that steep of a tariff rate would crush Apple's near-term profitability. That's why the stock is down so much year to date.\n\n^SPX data by YCharts\nBuying Apple stock now is a belief that two things will happen:\nOn April 10, reports indicated that Apple was flying iPhones from India to the U.S. to circumnavigate tariffs on China. If Apple feels China could be a longer-term risk, it could work to permanently shift manufacturing out of China toward India and other partners in Southeast Asia. However, investors may want to wait for Apple's upcoming earnings call on May 1 to better understand how the company plans to reduce the tariff impact.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nAs for Apple's pricing power, iPhone growth has slowed in recent years. But the company has made up for some of that slowdown by growing its high-margin services segment and repurchasing stock to grow earnings per share. Entertainment services include Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, Apple Books, and more. Apple also has a growing list of financial services, from Apple Pay to Apple Card and Apple Cash.\nApple has yet to make as big a splash in artificial intelligence as some investors may have hoped for, so there are fears that it lacks the pricing power it once had. However, services have enhanced the breadth of the Apple ecosystem.\nAll told, Apple stands out as a solid buy if you believe in its ability to navigate supply chain challenges and its pricing power. But it's also reasonable to take a wait-and-see approach until investors get more clarity on Apple's response to tariffs from the earnings call in a few weeks.\nNike's year-to-date losses are even more alarming, considering it was already one of the worst-performing components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year. Nike has sold off so much that it is now hovering around its lowest level in a decade.\nThe abridged version of Nike's problems is that it overly invested in switching the business away from wholesale partnerships to digital, which worked during the pandemic but proved a costly error in recent years, as the direct-to-consumer segment has been underperforming wholesale and Nike's brick-and-mortar stores. In addition to management blunders, Nike has been hit hard by formidable competition from Adidas and newer players like On Holding and Deckers Outdoor-owned Hoka.\nTariffs throw yet another wrench in the Nike investment thesis at a time when the company was already licking its wounds from past mistakes. Reports indicate that Nike makes 95% of its shoes in China, Vietnam, and Indonesia. China is a key market for Nike's sales as well.\nFor the nine months ended Feb. 28, Greater China sales were $5.11 billion compared to $14.87 billion in North America and $9.26 billion in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. During that period, Nike sold more footwear, apparel, and equipment in Greater China than the rest of Asia Pacific and Latin America combined -- with Greater China making up a significant 15.1% of total Nike Brand revenue during that nine-month period.\nLike Apple, buying Nike stock now is a bet on the power of its brand, that it can turn the business around, handle competition, and pivot its supply chain. However, Nike is arguably more vulnerable than Apple, considering the business was already in the middle of a turnaround before the onset of trade tensions.\nNike has gone from a growth stock to a dividend-paying value stock. Despite its struggles, the company has continued to buy back stock and has 23 consecutive years of dividend raises. The sell-off in the stock price has pushed Nike's yield up to a 10-year high of 2.8% and its price-to-earnings ratio down to a 10-year low of just 18. Although if tariffs stick around, Nike's earnings will almost certainly fall in the near term -- making its valuation less appealing.\nApple and Nike may operate in entirely different industries, but the buy case for both companies is similar. Both face serious tariff risks, and neither company has been growing earnings at breakneck rates in recent years. However, these are two top brands whose valuations could look cheap in hindsight if they can endure this challenging period.\nApple stands out as the safer all-around play, whereas Nike has a higher risk and potential reward if it can turn the business around and navigate tariffs. Both stocks could be worth buying now if you have a long-term horizon. However, it's also reasonable to keep both stocks on a watch list and wait for upcoming earnings calls for more clarity on their strategies, given we are sailing through uncharted waters.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.\nThe market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump’s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year.\nThe year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios.\nIn the second month of 2025, the US government’s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States’ tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services.\nDW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods & services in the latest round of “Trump Tariffs”. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering “continuous stagflation”, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment.\nThis scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children’s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children’s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President & CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing:\n“Make sure that money can be talked about, that there’s no taboos…so that your children are learning those really good financial literacy skills that they need to set themselves up for success for the rest of their life.”\nInvesting in the markets for your children’s future has the advantage of time. In a report by MorningStar, investments in stocks have the added benefit of compounding return, which means the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to grow exponentially. CNBC reported on billionaire investor Mark Cuban and how he made billions from his first few million with a long-term view on his investments.\nTo compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources and gathered the stocks they collectively favored. These stocks have a long-standing history of performance, with strong balance sheets and sound financials. Then, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database of billionaire stock holdings to arrive at our list of 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires as of Q4 2024. For the stocks with the same number of billionaire holdings, we have used the total value of billionaire holdings as a secondary metric to rank the stocks. Billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of trainers and athletes displaying a wide range of athletic and casual footwear.\nNo. of Billionaires: 14\nValue of total Investment by Billionaires: $3.095 billion\nNIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a global leader in the athletic goods industry. The company designs, develops, markets, and sells a wide range of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services worldwide under prominent brands such as NIKE, Jumpman, Converse, and Chuck Taylor. These brands are considered household names for both children & parents/ adults alike.\nIn the Q3 2025 earnings report, NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE) revenue was $11.27 billion, down 9.33% YoY, although beating analyst estimates by $231.5 million. EPS was $0.54, also beating estimates by $0.25. The company attributes the decline in sales to rising inflation, high tariffs but remains a market leader in high-quality athletic goods. It is among the best kid-friendly stocks to invest in.\nRecent declines in international markets such as the Middle East, Europe, and Asia (including China & Vietnam) were the result of reduced buying by price-conscious consumers. As per the United States International Trade Commission (USITC), China is the largest importer of shoes from the United States at 37%, while Vietnam is responsible for 29.8%. China was hit with the aforementioned 34% trade tariffs, while Vietnam was hit even harder with 46%. This is likely to further impact NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE)’s overall revenue figure. Experts consider these conditions as an optimal time to invest in the stock to take advantage of the lower price.\nOverall, NKE ranks 6th on our list of best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of NKE, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Despite this launch, Nike's share price dipped 2.2% over the past week, a movement contrasting with the broader market’s 5.8% gain. This slight decline in Nike's price might not align with the broader market trend influenced by external factors, such as overall market optimism from major tech stocks rallying on tariff exemption news, which appeared to influence broader market sentiment more positively.\nBuy, Hold or Sell NIKE? View our complete analysis and fair value estimate and you decide.\nFind companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value.\nThe recent collaboration between Nike and Kool-Aid, featuring the vibrant Nike x Kool-Aid Ja 2 sneaker, may add fresh appeal to Nike's product lineup. This partnership aligns with Nike's strategy to enhance brand storytelling and leverage sports performance dimensions as growth drivers. Although the share price fell 2.2% recently, this may be a short-term fluctuation possibly reflecting external market conditions rather than an immediate impact of the collaboration. Over a longer period of five years, Nike's total shareholder return, which includes share price and dividends, was a decline of 34.31%, underscoring challenges the company has faced in maintaining upward momentum.\nCompared to the past year, Nike's performance has lagged behind both the US Market and the broader Luxury industry, which are indicators of the competitive and economic pressures it encounters. Analysts predict a modest revenue growth of around 1.9% annually, alongside a slight increase in profit margins to 9.9% within three years. However, for Nike to meet the consensus price target of US$78.49, the stock would need to see a significant increase from its current trading price of US$53.27, indicating a trading discount of about 33.4% against the target. The Kool-Aid collaboration may help boost revenue and support these forecasts by enhancing brand engagement and driving full-price sales, aiding in net margin improvements and inventory turnover.\nEvaluate NIKE's historical performance by accessing our past performance report.\n This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

Many of them provide website URLs and contact details for viewers to order directly from these suppliers. “Why don’t you just contact us and buy from us? You won’t believe the prices we give you,” said one creator selling luxury handbags.\nIn another video, TikTok creator @LunaSourcingChina, stands outside a factory she says makes Lululemon yoga leggings for $5 to $6 even though they retail in the US for more than $100. “The material and craftsmanship are basically the same,” she says.\nA Lululemon spokesperson said the company manufactures about 3% of its finished goods in Mainland China and that authentic products are only available for purchase at Lululemon stores, official websites and authorized partners.\nSome of the most popular videos – many uploaded in March but only gaining traction in recent days – have been amplified by a video titled “China exposed the truth” with 8.3 million views and 492,000 likes, as of Monday morning, New York time. The one that reveals the Chinese supplier to Lululemon garnered 2.6 million views and over 215,000 likes, while a “How we bypass tariffs” clip had close to 1 million views and 118,000 likes.\n“This campaign appears to be a calculated attempt to undermine President Trump’s tariff policy on China by leveraging TikTok to promote Chinese manufacturing as cheaper, more desirable, and accessible—even in defiance of trade restrictions,” said Alex Goldenberg, senior advisor at the Network Contagion Research Institute at Rutgers University.\nWhile it’s unclear how ordering directly from Chinese suppliers would allow consumers to sidestep the tariff — the duty waiver for small parcels that are sent to American homes is also being scrapped from May 2 — the videos are aimed at undermining the White House narrative that the economic measures are in Americans’ interest.\nThe levy on Chinese exports is now 145%, while Trump has paused additional tariffs on other countries for 90 days.\nThe flood of posts also reflects the increased effectiveness of Chinese creators at reaching into the daily lives of ordinary Americans. TikTok’s algorithm, and its ability to influence what information millions of US users see, is one of the main driving forces behind US government efforts to force its Chinese owner ByteDance Ltd. to relinquish control of its international operations. TikTok didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOther Chinese social media apps like Xiaohongshu, or Red Note, have also gained popularity among young US users amid uncertainty around access to TikTok.\n“These posts are much more confrontational and mocking of the US, rather than showing it as a threat,” said Tom Harper, lecturer in Chinese international relations at the University of East London. They follow a wave of AI-generated images depicting Americans working on assembly lines, Harper added.\nSome of the videos directly criticize US trade policies and call on American citizens to take action.\n“For decades your government and oligarchs ship your jobs to China, not for diplomacy, not for peace, but to exploit cheap labor and in the process, they hollow out your middle class, crash your working class and told you to be proud while they sold your future for profit,” user @neil778027 said in a video. “Americans, you don’t need a tariff, you need a revolution.”\nOn Friday, the US announced tariff exemptions on a range of Chinese products including electronics, computers and semiconductors, although it’s not known how long these exceptions will apply. Regardless, they will not affect most of the goods exported by China to the US, including the clothing and accessories produced by Chinese suppliers featured in the TikTok videos.\nMany European high-end luxury brands are also featured, but the makers of the videos don’t explain why they are featuring European brands in their pushback against the US.\nAnother key question raised by the videos is whether the factories have non-disclosure agreements with their international clients and how the videos will potentially affect long-standing business relationships between brands and their manufacturers.\nCameron Johnson, senior partner at Shanghai-based consultancy Tidalwave Solutions, who recently visited the Chinese trading hub of Yiwu, sees it as part of a fundamental shift in purchasing practices for China.\n“In the past, you might use a middleman or a trading company to source your products for your deal with quality control or go visit the factory, establish those relationships, and then maybe you would come on occasion,” he told Bloomberg TV. “But now what we’re seeing is just a complete democratization of sourcing products.”\n--With assistance from Annabelle Droulers, Daniela Wei, Zheping Huang and Omar El Chmouri.\n(Adds comment in seventh paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nCheap Consumer Goods Are the American Dream, Actually\nWorld Travelers Are Rethinking Vacation Plans to the US\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nNike Inc.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: \nUBS upgraded HubSpot (HUBS) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $675, down from $775. The firm cites valuation for the upgrade with the shares down 35% since mid-February\nBarclays upgraded Autoliv (ALV) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $97, down from $110. With the firm's recommendations shifting to a more defensive positioning, it believes Autoliv can relatively outperform the sector.\nHSBC upgraded KKR (KKR) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $119, down from $170. The firm says that despite heightened macro uncertainty, it sees opportunities.\nNeedham upgraded Neurocrine (NBIX) to Buy from Hold with a $138 price target. The firm cites its positive physician survey on Crenessity's ramp in congenital adrenal hyperplasia for the upgrade.\nBofA upgraded DuPont (DD) to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $75, down from $88. While the firm does see earnings risks to DuPont from trade disruptions, it views the near 30% pullback in the shares in the last two months as excessive. BofA also upgraded Westlake (WLK) to Buy from Neutral.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nBarclays downgraded General Motors (GM) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $40, down from $70. The downgrade of GM reflects the company's \"significant risk\" to near-term earnings from tariffs.\nBofA downgraded PepsiCo (PEP) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $155, down from $185. Frito-Lay North America's growth is likely to remain below long-term trendline this year and while international segments are scaling and making large contributions to sales and profit growth, it's not enough at this point to make up for slower growth at the North American snacks segment, the firm tells investors.\nBarclays downgraded Mobileye (MBLY) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $14, down from $22. The downgrade of Mobileye reflects its thesis that auto tech is at risk of a slower uptake.\nBaird downgraded Universal Health (UHS) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $224, down from $274. The firm sees minimal incremental buyers of stocks in the managed care and healthcare facilities group until the policy overhang clears. Baird also downgraded Tenet Healthcare (THC), Molina Healthcare (MOH), Elevance Health (ELV) and HCA Healthcare (HCA) to Neutral from Outperform.\nWells Fargo downgraded Howmet Aerospace (HWM) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $118, down from $132. The firm cut estimates across the aerospace group, as it thinks a global economic slowdown hits both original equipment makers and the aftermarket. Wells also downgraded Hexcel (HXL) to Equal Weight from Overweight.\nTop 5 Initiations: \nBerenberg initiated coverage of Nike (NKE) with a Hold rating and $58 price target. Within sporting goods, the firm favors incumbents over \"challenger brands\" given their \"deep\" franchise values which underpin the long-term sustainability of returns.\nBenchmark initiated coverage of MercadoLibre (MELI) with a Buy rating and $2,500 price target. MercadoLibre \"stands out as a dominant regional leader in the global e-commerce setting,\" says the firm.\nPiper Sandler initiated coverage of RxSight (RXST) with a Neutral rating and $18 price target. The firm likes the company's novel light adjustable lens technology and that it plays in the \"massive\" innovative intraocular lens marketplace, but is taking a \"wait-and-see approach.\"\nCiti reinstated coverage of Omnicom (OMC) and Interpublic Group (IPG) with Buy ratings and price targets of $103 and $35, respectively. U.S. tariffs will likely hurt U.S. advertising spending, but the firm finds both stocks \"very compelling\" even with the tariff impact.\nNeedham initiated coverage of Aurora Innovation (AUR) with a Buy rating and $10 price target. The firm says the company is positioned to leverage its Aurora Driver platform and industry partnerships to create the market for autonomous trucking on U.S. highways. \nPresident Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on some tariffs.

On the morning of the 9th, Trump posted on social media that it was a “great time to buy.” About four hours later, he announced he was suspending tariffs, propelling the S&P 500 index to a 9.5% gain, its biggest rally since 2008.\nGreene’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nGreene, one of the first lawmakers to file a disclosure since Trump announced his tariffs, is an active trader in stocks, filing eight disclosures so far this year. She’s been particularly bullish on the semiconductor and tech industries. Her sale of Treasuries, though, was the first time she’s sold after buying more than $500,000 of the government-backed securities since the beginning of 2025.\nCongressional Democrats have urged investigations into whether people connected to Trump profited from the timing of the tariff announcements.\nIn a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she did not know which officials may have had advance knowledge, but called it “unconscionable” that insiders may have profited from the market volatility.\nThe disclosure reports only require members to list values of transactions in broad ranges, and do not contain specific times of execution or cost basis, so it’s unclear precisely how many of Greene’s trades happened before Trump broke the news of the tariff pause.\nBut at least $11,011 to $165,000 in purchases came on April 8. As of 11:20 a.m. Tuesday in New York, shares of Blackstone, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Tesla traded higher than at any point on that day.\nOver the two days, her stock purchases totaled $21,021 to $315,000. She sold $50,001 to $100,000 of US Treasuries on April 8.\nAmong the other names in Greene’s purchases were chipmakers Nvidia Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., along with apparel companies Lululemon Athletica Inc. and Nike Inc.\n(Updates with Greene’s trading history in fifth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nThe chairman of the Federal Reserve has warned that Donald Trump’s trade war will fuel inflation and keep interest rates higher for longer, triggering a steep sell-off on Wall Street.\nLululemon (LULU) has received quite a bit of attention from Zacks.com users lately. Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.\nSince his inauguration in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has announced - and sometimes reversed - tariffs on a slew of products and countries.  \"Approximately 70% of our aluminum produced in Canada is destined for U.S. customers and is now subject to 25% tariff costs ... Currently the net annual result is approximately $100 million negative for our business,\" CEO William Oplinger said during a post-earnings conference call.  The aluminum producer said the tariffs on Canadian imports had cost the company roughly $20 million in the first quarter, ended March 31.\nThe stock market has been crashing this year and if you're a long-term investor, it can be a good time to invest in companies at discounted valuations.  Three stocks that are in a free fall right now that I still wouldn't bother buying today are Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Tilray Brands (NASDAQ: TLRY), and Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI).  Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla are down 37% year to date, and there is no shortage of reasons to explain why the stock is struggling.\nRecessions are a natural part of the economic cycle, but they can have severe negative consequences for your savings and finances. To minimize its impact on your life, take these steps to recession-proof your savings.\nWith President Donald Trump announcing a wide set of tariffs, there could be increased costs for a range of companies.  Visa (NYSE: V) is a giant in the payments processing space, helping to ensure secure and convenient transactions between vendors and their customers.  The company boasts a solid track record of growing its revenue, net income, and free cash flow, as shown in the table below.\nClark Howard, a prominent consumer finance expert, entrepreneur, author and radio host, challenges the conventional wisdom that striving for an 800 credit score (or higher) is a universally wise...\nA net gain on a home sale of $680k potentially could lead to having to pay capital gains taxes.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nNike (NKE -2.14%) needs no introduction. The global sportswear icon has been leading the industry for decades. It's a well-known consumer brand that has a presence virtually all over the world. People have recognized the business as having strength in product innovation and marketing.\nBut these strengths haven't prevented the consumer discretionary stock from tanking. As of this writing (April 12), it trades 69% below its record high. Nike's winning culture has been replaced by a losing track record due to ongoing challenges.\nIt's still hard to ignore the current dip, which might present a rare buying opportunity. If you're taking a closer look at Nike stock, know that adding the company to your portfolio is only a brilliant move if you believe one thing.\nInvestors seem to be avoiding Nike shares. This is clearly evident by looking at the valuation. They sell at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.1, which is basically their cheapest level in 10 years. Value investors are paying attention.\nThe stock's disappointing performance is warranted. Nike's revenue is declining. It generated $11.3 billion in sales in the third quarter of 2025 (ended Feb. 28), down 9% year over year. The leadership team expects a mid-teens percentage drop in the current fiscal quarter. This is happening at the same time that Nike's competitors continue to grow their top lines.\nUncharacteristically, Nike has struggled to release fresh new products to keep customers excited. And it prioritized digital sales at the expense of its third-party retailing partners. \nTariffs aren't helping this situation, either. Nike produces nearly all of its shoes in Vietnam, China, and Indonesia, countries that have high levies placed on products coming from them. We don't know how things will ultimately play out. However, Nike's margins could take a hit, or its customers could see higher prices. Neither of these scenarios will boost investor confidence.\nBuying Nike stock is a brilliant move, in the face of current headwinds, only if you think earnings per share (EPS) will be higher in the next five years. This requires, first and foremost, for revenue to start growing again. The leadership team mentioned that things should stabilize after Q4 2025.\nNonetheless, it's extremely difficult to predict when EPS will bottom out. Getting to mid-single-digit revenue gains and improving profitability will help.\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates expect EPS to rise at a compound annual rate of 15% between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2027. The best-case scenario is for the double-digit gains to continue after this forecast period. The idea is that the stock price should mimic the trajectory of bottom-line performance. It will require a lot of patience from investors.\nNike deserves credit. It's the leader in the global market for sportswear. It has one of the most powerful brands on the face of the planet. Its worldwide presence gives it unmatched visibility. And while its challenges are hard to ignore, the business generated $48 billion in revenue in the past 12 months. Nike isn't going away anytime soon.\nLow expectations (from the cheap P/E ratio) mixed with higher EPS five years from now can result in a fantastic outcome for investors. The question of buying the stock ultimately comes down to whether you believe management can successfully execute a turnaround by highlighting the brand in the eyes of consumers, releasing exciting new products, and making sure it's striking the right balance between wholesale and direct distribution channels.\nThe risk is high. But so is the potential reward. \n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Nike, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against other mid- and large-cap stocks insiders are buying after Trump’s tariff rollout.\nOn April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump declared “Liberation Day” and signed Executive Order 14257, imposing a baseline 10% tariff on nearly all U.S. imports, effective April 5. Higher tariffs—ranging from 11% to 50%—were scheduled for 57 countries and territories, including the European Union, China, and Japan. These increased rates were set to begin April 9 but were postponed for 90 days, with the exception of China, which continued to face elevated tariffs.\nIn April, some insiders took advantage of the dip to buy shares, while others chose to sell. Analyzing insider trading can provide valuable insights: purchases often signal confidence in the company’s future, while sales may reflect personal or diversification choices. Therefore, insider trading should be evaluated in the context of the company’s financial health and overall market conditions.\nToday, we’re focusing on stocks that insiders are buying in April. Using Insider Monkey’s insider trading screener, we identified 19 mid- and large-cap companies where at least one insider bought shares between April 2 and April 14. From this list, we ranked the top 19 stocks based on the highest value of insider purchases during this period.\nOur research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds, focusing on insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of trainers and athletes displaying a wide range of athletic and casual footwear.\nMarket Cap: $81.79 billion\nNIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a globally recognized and popular brand that designs, markets, and sells athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment under names like NIKE, Converse, and Jumpman. Its products are sold through retail stores, digital platforms, and independent distributors around the world. It is also one of the 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Nike (NYSE:NKE) reported $11.3 billion in revenue, a 9% decline from the previous year. Gross margin also fell by 330 basis points, reaching 41.5%. Wholesale revenues were $6.2 billion, down 7% on a reported basis and down 4% on a currency-neutral basis year-over-year. Net income was $800 million, down 32%, and diluted earnings per share was $0.54, a decrease of 30%.\nOn April 4, one insider, a director at Nike, Holmes Robert Swan acquired $502,756 worth of Nike shares at an average price of $58.46 per share. With this purchase of 8,600 shares, Swan increased his holdings to 31,983 shares.\nAccording to the 32 analysts, Nike (NYSE:NKE) stock is a “Moderate Buy” with a price target of $86.19 per share. The average price target suggests a potential upside of 55.67% from the latest price.\nOverall, NKE ranks 12th on our list of mid- and large-cap stocks insiders are buying after Trump’s tariff rollout. While we acknowledge the potential of NKE, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.
