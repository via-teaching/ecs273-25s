We recently published a list of 19 Mid- And Large-Cap Stocks Insiders Are Buying After Trump’s Tariff Rollout. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against other mid- and large-cap stocks insiders are buying after Trump’s tariff rollout.
On April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump declared “Liberation Day” and signed Executive Order 14257, imposing a baseline 10% tariff on nearly all U.S. imports, effective April 5. Higher tariffs—ranging from 11% to 50%—were scheduled for 57 countries and territories, including the European Union, China, and Japan. These increased rates were set to begin April 9 but were postponed for 90 days, with the exception of China, which continued to face elevated tariffs.
In April, some insiders took advantage of the dip to buy shares, while others chose to sell. Analyzing insider trading can provide valuable insights: purchases often signal confidence in the company’s future, while sales may reflect personal or diversification choices. Therefore, insider trading should be evaluated in the context of the company’s financial health and overall market conditions.
Today, we’re focusing on stocks that insiders are buying in April. Using Insider Monkey’s insider trading screener, we identified 19 mid- and large-cap companies where at least one insider bought shares between April 2 and April 14. From this list, we ranked the top 19 stocks based on the highest value of insider purchases during this period.
