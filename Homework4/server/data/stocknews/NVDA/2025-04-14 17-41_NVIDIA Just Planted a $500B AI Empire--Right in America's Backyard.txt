NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is going bigand going home. In a move that could redefine the global AI landscape, the chip giant is shifting its manufacturing base to the U.S., partnering with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Foxconn (FXCOF), Wistron, Amkor, and SPIL to produce its Blackwell AI chips and supercomputers. The company has already secured over a million square feet of manufacturing space in Arizona and Texas, with production set to scale aggressively over the next 1215 months. For the first time ever, the full stack of NVIDIA's AI infrastructurefrom chipmaking to packagingis being built entirely in the U.S., with a moonshot goal: half a trillion dollars' worth of AI systems in just four years. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. CEO Jensen Huang is not just hedging against geopolitical riskhe's engineering a whole new AI supply chain. After reportedly dodging export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chip by promising more domestic investment, NVIDIA now finds itself at the center of America's AI push. Huang called it the engine of the world's AI infrastructureand he's backing that up with deep investments in robotics, automation, and digital twins to future-proof operations. The company says the U.S. expansion could generate hundreds of thousands of jobs and unlock trillions in economic value over the long term. But this isn't just about headlines and hype. The real challenge lies in execution. Trade tensions with China could disrupt material supplies, and America's chronic shortage of skilled chip workers could bottleneck growth. Still, if Huang pulls this off, NVIDIA won't just be leading the AI raceit'll be rebuilding America's industrial backbone in the process. Investors betting on long-term AI infrastructure? Keep your eyes here. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Apple and NVIDIA received temporary tariff relief to avoid increased import costs and price hikes, prompting speculation on which stock to invest in. “Tesla (TSLA) has been holding up quite well over the past couple of weeks,” Schwab Network Correspondent George Tsilis said on the network recently. Moreover, TSLA does “not necessarily have the most exposure to international” catalysts, Tsilis added. An economist who worked for CME Group in the past, Tsilis was also a Financial Advisor for […] Another tariff climb down from the Trump administration sparked a relief rally in world stocks and bonds on Monday, but smoldering growth fears and deep-rooted doubts over the wisdom and execution of U.S. trade policy limited the euphoria.  Zoom out and the world continues to reassess its long-held faith in the dollar and U.S. Treasuries, the fates of which increasingly appear to be in the hands of foreign private sector investors. President Trump claimed that his re-election and tariffs were the reasons why Nvidia announced that it would build its AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S. A glut of the slow-selling delivery vans has built up on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border as GM fails to gain ground against Ford and Rivian. Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are currently 26% below their peak from December last year (as of April 10), a drop that has been spurred by ongoing tariff announcements.  As of this writing, there is a huge 145% tariff that's implemented on goods leaving China for the U.S. If this remains in place, it could harm Apple, because 80% of its production is still based in China, according to estimates from Evercore.  If the increased costs are eaten by Apple, on the other hand, its profitability will definitely take a hit. Two that look like screaming buys right now are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).  Each of these stocks is so cheap right now that investors cannot afford to miss out on the deals the market is offering.  At first glance, Taiwan Semiconductor appears to be an odd pick.
