NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) isgoingbigand going home. In a move that could redefine the global AI landscape, the chip giant is shifting its manufacturing base to the U.S., partnering with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Foxconn (FXCOF), Wistron, Amkor, and SPIL to produce its Blackwell AI chips and supercomputers. The company has already secured over a million square feet of manufacturing space in Arizona and Texas, with production set to scale aggressively over the next 1215 months. For the first time ever, the full stack of NVIDIA's AI infrastructurefrom chipmaking to packagingis being built entirely in the U.S., with a moonshot goal: half a trillion dollars' worth of AI systems in just four years.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.
CEO Jensen Huang is not just hedging against geopolitical riskhe's engineering a whole new AI supply chain. After reportedly dodging export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chip by promising more domestic investment, NVIDIA now finds itself at the center of America's AI push. Huang called it the engine of the world's AI infrastructureand he's backing that up with deep investments in robotics, automation, and digital twins to future-proof operations. The company says the U.S. expansion could generate hundreds of thousands of jobs and unlock trillions in economic value over the long term.
But this isn't just about headlines and hype. The real challenge lies in execution. Trade tensions with China could disrupt material supplies, and America's chronic shortage of skilled chip workers could bottleneck growth. Still, if Huang pulls this off, NVIDIA won't just be leading the AI raceit'll be rebuilding America's industrial backbone in the process. Investors betting on long-term AI infrastructure? Keep your eyes here.
