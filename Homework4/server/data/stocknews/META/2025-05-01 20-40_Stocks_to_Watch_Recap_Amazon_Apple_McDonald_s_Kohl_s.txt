Itâ€™s been an interesting week for  General Motors  one that has culminated with a guidance cut.  GM  Â reported first-quarter numbers on Tuesday but delayed its earnings conference call because President Donald Trump was set to change automotive tariff policies later in the day.  The car business still faces stiff tariffsâ€”25% levies on imported carsâ€”but things improved at the margin.
Meta Platforms  roundly beat first-quarter earnings expectations.  Its shares were rising early Thursday, though the companyâ€™s latest outlook around capital expenditures could give some investors pause.  Revenue for the quarter reached $42.3 billion, above expectations of $41.3 billion, and up 16% on the year, Meta reported Wednesday.
The automaker postponed its full-year guidance until after President Trump announces his revised tariff structure.
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Apple on Thursday trimmed its share buyback program by $10 billion, with CEO Tim Cook telling analysts that tariffs could add about $900 million in costs this quarter as the iPhone maker shifts its vast supply chain to minimize the impact of President Donald Trump's trade war.  Cook also said Apple's planned $500 billion in spending to expand its U.S. footprint would involve both capital outlays and increased operational expenses as it builds out server and chip factories with its manufacturing partners.  In addition, he outlined how Apple has started to build up a stockpile of products so that the majority of its devices sold in the U.S. this quarter will not come from China.
Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said the company knows how auto tariffs will affect its costs, but doesn't know how competitors will respond to the levies. Referring to Stellantis and General Motors, Farley said: "Are they going to build 10 factories? Are they going to take pricing and pass it on to the customers this summer?"  Farley said his automaker has seen double-digit sales increases since March and shrinking inventories at dealerships amid President Trump's tariffs.
The sportâ€™s efforts in the U.S. spent decades lost in translation. But with American owners and three stateside Grands Prix, F1 finally has the foothold it has been searching for.
