Meta (NASDAQ:META) just rolled out a sweeping expansion of its teen safety featuresand it's not just a PR move. Starting today, Teen Accounts are going live on Facebook and Messenger across the US, UK, Australia, and Canada. These accounts come with built-in guardrails: no Live streaming for under-16s without parental approval, and no turning off Meta's image-blurring tool in DMs unless a parent signs off. Instagram's had these features since last year, with 97% of 13- to 15-year-olds sticking to the default settings. Now Meta's extending the same playbook across its family of apps in a move aimed at both regaining teen usersand rebuilding trust with regulators and parents alike. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with META. Why now? Because Meta's been under serious fire. EU watchdogs are investigating how it protects minors, and a 2023 U.S. lawsuit accused its platforms of becoming hunting grounds for predators. With over 54 million Teen Accounts already active globally, this rollout signals that Meta isn't just reactingit's trying to get ahead. Teens will now get automatic limits on who can contact them, reminders to log off after an hour, and notifications shut down overnight. And for those under 16, parental permission is the key to unlocking anything less restrictive. But make no mistakethis is also Meta playing offense. Facebook has been bleeding younger users for years to TikTok and Snapchat. These Teen Accounts are part safety net, part growth strategy. By defaulting young users into these curated experiences, Meta is betting it can make its platforms feel safer, more parent-approved, and ultimately more appealing for the next wave of users. For investors, the real question is whether these changes will do more than protect reputationsand actually spark a meaningful shift in engagement and retention across Meta's aging ecosystem. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. The new settings will provide enhanced protections for millions of teen users. The authorisation was based on data from the multicentre Phase III SELECT-GCA trial.
