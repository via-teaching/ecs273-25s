Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg hoped to avoid a high-stakes antitrust trial playing out this week in Washington, D.C., but he wasn't willing to pay the price US antitrust cops wanted. He and the Federal Trade Commission encountered stratospheric differences on what it would take to settle a case seeking the breakup of Zuckerberg's empire, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. In March, Zuckerberg offered the head of the FTC $450 million, according to the Wall Street Journal, well short of the $30 billion demanded by the FTC. He eventually increased it to $1 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal, but FTC boss Andrew Ferguson wouldn't accept anything lower than $18 billion. The revelations about Zuckerberg's attempts to settle with the Trump administration add a new layer of drama to the legal battle between the social media giant and the FTC, which alleges Meta became a monopoly in the market for "personal social networking" by buying up potential rival social media startups such as Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta's Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion and WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion. The FTC reviewed and approved the purchases but now wants a judge to force Meta to divest both of them. Zuckerberg and his top aides made multiple visits to the White House to meet with President Trump and administration officials before the trial began. Zuckerberg also made two visits to the president's private Mar-a-Lago club. And Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund. Trump, according to the Wall Street Journal, did ask staff to work on a potential settlement. But Ferguson and the Justice Department's antitrust chief, Gail Slater, persuaded Trump to support their recommendation to proceed to trial. This week in court, the FTC wasted no time laying out evidence against Zuckerberg by calling the CEO as its first trial witness. Instagram became the FTC's central topic as prosecutors confronted Zuckerberg with his past emails. In a 2012 email, Zuckerberg told Facebook's then-CFO, David Ebersman, that purchasing Instagram and other startups could be viewed as a way for Facebook to buy time. "Even if some new competitor springs up, buying Instagram, Path, Foursquare etc. now will give us a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again," Zuckerberg wrote, according to an account of the testimony reported by Bloomberg. Zuckerberg agreed under questioning by the FTC's attorney that buying Instagram was intended to "neutralize a competitor," but he added that the purchase was also meant to boost Facebook's quality and functionality. ​​"I read this as talking about incorporating the functionality and staying ahead in terms of quality. But scale is one aspect of that, and time is one aspect of that," Zuckerberg testified, according to Bloomberg. "It's not accurate to say that the only reason we were interested was the scale or growth rate, which I think that your question is implying." Zuckerberg's testimony concluded on Wednesday by addressing Facebook's view of the Chinese social media app TikTok launched in 2018. Zuckerberg viewed the app's increasing popularity as a "highly urgent" threat and "we observed that our growth slowed down dramatically." "TikTok is still bigger than either Facebook or Instagram, and I don't like it when our competitors do better than us," Zuckerberg said, according to reports. Antitrust lawyers have said TikTok presents a potential sticking point for the FTC's case because the company offers similar services to Facebook and Instagram, yet is excluded in the group of companies that the commission claims compete in the market for personal social networking. "We haven't been shy about explaining why it doesn't make sense for the FTC to bring a case to trial that requires it to prove something every 17-year-old in America knows is absurd — that Instagram doesn’t compete with TikTok," a Meta spokesperson said. "We are prepared to win at trial." Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow Alexis on X @alexiskweed.

Trump's Treasury secretary wants business owners to relax. That's hard to do when Trump's tariffs are pushing costs higher and profits lower and threatening a recession. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Monday took the stand during the first day of a trial he hoped to avoid as the tech giant faces off against President Trump's antitrust cops in a case that threatens the $1.3 trillion empire Zuckerberg built. Facilitating and financing trades is proving to be a winning proposition for big banks in a chaotic market. The Trump administration plans to eliminate the IRS' Direct File program, an electronic system for filing tax returns directly to the agency for free, according to two people familiar with the decision.  The program developed during Joe Biden's presidency was credited by users with making tax filing easy, fast and economical.  The program had been in limbo since the start of the Trump administration as Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency have slashed their way through the federal government. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday the central bank will 'wait for greater clarity' before considering any changes to interest rates as he expects President Trump’s tariffs to generate 'higher inflation and slower growth.' All is not lost when it comes to investing in Nvidia. Here's what Lawrence McDonald of the Bear Traps Report has to say. Big banks are offering the latest view of how their customers are faring amid President Trump's tariff turmoil, and it's not all bad — at least for now. (Reuters) -Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested on Wednesday that hopes the central bank will step in to tamp down on market volatility are likely misplaced.  Asked if the Fed would intervene to counter sharp declines in the stock market, Powell said "I'm going to say no, with an explanation."  "What I think is going on in markets is markets are processing what's going on, markets are struggling with a lot of uncertainty and that means volatility," Powell said in an appearance in Chicago.
