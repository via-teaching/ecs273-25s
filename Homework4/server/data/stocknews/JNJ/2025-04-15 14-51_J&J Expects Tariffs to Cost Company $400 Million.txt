The administration announced earlier it would conduct an investigation into drug imports. That move is widely seen as a first step toward imposing new levies. Earnings and revenue both beat estimates for the quarter. Johnson & Johnson CFO Joe Wolk joined Bloomberg Open Interest to talk about how tariffs could hit the industry and the drug maker's bottom line. While the top- and bottom-line numbers for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) give a sense of how the business performed in the quarter ended March 2025, it could be worth looking at how some of its key metrics compare to Wall Street estimates and year-ago values. Pre-markets are down somewhat, following yesterday's +3/4-percent gain on the Dow and the S&P 500, +2/3-percent gain for the Nasdaq. President Trump described the Russian ballistic-missile strike that killed dozens of people in the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy as “a mistake.” J&J beats first-quarter earnings and sales estimates. It raises sales guidance for 2025 to reflect the addition of Caplyta from the Intra-Cellular acquisition. Johnson & Johnson stock fell alongside the broader market, despite beating first-quarter calls and hiking its 2025 sales guidance. New tariffs, primarily on medical technology products, are projected to add $400 million in costs this year, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said. C's first-quarter 2025 results benefit from a rise in NII and a fall in expenses. Rising loans and deposits balance acts as another positive. Economic jitters have consumers looking for more ways to save, Albertsons executives said. “Customers in general are thinking about their budgets and how to optimize them, maybe eating out less,” said Susan Morris, the supermarket chain's chief operating officer. While the top- and bottom-line numbers for Citigroup (C) give a sense of how the business performed in the quarter ended March 2025, it could be worth looking at how some of its key metrics compare to Wall Street estimates and year-ago values. Johnson & Johnson forecasts about $400 million in costs this year related to tariffs on medical devices, said Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk in an interview.  Wolk said the estimated costs represent a "worst-case scenario" and take into account President Trump’s 90-day pause, China's retaliatory tariffs and the resumption of the U.S. tariffs.  J&J isn't doing anything differently yet in response to tariffs, Wolk added. Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results Sign in to access your portfolio
