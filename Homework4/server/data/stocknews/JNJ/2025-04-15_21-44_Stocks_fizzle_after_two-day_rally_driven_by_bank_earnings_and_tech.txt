Apple also edged higher, extending its 2% gain from Monday, which followed a surprise tariff exemption from the Trump administration.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Meanwhile, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (<a class="link" data-rapid_p="23" data-ylk="slk:HPE;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://qz.com/quote/HPE" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HPE</a>) caught a wave of investor enthusiasm after activist firm Elliott Investment Management revealed a $1.5 billion stake and backed the company’s newly announced strategic review. The broader market got a lift as chipmakers, software stocks, and AI plays rode the wave, with early signs pointing to a tech-led session and plenty of earnings drama still to come.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Auto stocks gave back some of Monday’s gains, with Rivian (<a class="link" data-rapid_p="25" data-ylk="slk:RIVN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://qz.com/quote/RIVN" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RIVN</a>), Ford, and GM trading lower despite President Trump floating a potential delay in auto tariffs. “A US car with all US parts made in the US is a fictional tale,” analysts at Wedbush wrote, warning that the proposed tariffs — if not paused — could send the industry into “upside down mode” and trigger widespread supply-chain disruption.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">U.S. stock futures edged down Tuesday morning, with the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average trading just below the break-even line as investors braced for <a class="link" data-rapid_p="26" data-ylk="slk:a flurry of corporate earnings;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://qz.com/netflix-goldman-sachs-citi-bank-america-earnings-stocks-1851775909?_gl=1*1sllrr9*_ga*MzUxNzY2NjAwLjE3MjAwMTcyMjA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDczMTM3Ni4yOTAuMS4xNzQ0NzQ4MjUyLjIuMC4w" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a flurry of corporate earnings</a>.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The subdued start followed <a class="link" data-rapid_p="27" data-ylk="slk:a tech-driven rally on Monday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://qz.com/sp500-dow-nasdaq-apple-stock-goldman-sachs-earnings-1851776010" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a tech-driven rally on Monday</a>, a temporary lift amid lingering concerns around tariffs and <a class="link" data-rapid_p="28" data-ylk="slk:broader economic uncertainty;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://qz.com/ceos-predict-recession-chief-executive-tariffs-1851776020" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">broader economic uncertainty</a>.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Goldman Sachs (<a class="link" data-rapid_p="29" data-ylk="slk:GS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://qz.com/quote/GS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GS</a>) kicked off the week’s earnings slate with a profit jump, even as <a class="link" data-rapid_p="30" data-ylk="slk:CEO David Solomon warned of a “markedly different” environment;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://qz.com/goldman-sachs-blackrock-morgan-stanley-citigroup-1851776030" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CEO David Solomon warned of a “markedly different” environment</a> in the current quarter.

Like Goldman Sachs, the bank benefited from market volatility, which juiced results even as the broader economic outlook remains uncertain.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Looking to Bank of America’s consumer banking division, revenue rose 3% to $10.5 billion, with combined credit and debit card spend hitting $228 billion — up 4% from a year ago. The bank added about 250,000 new consumer checking accounts, marking its 25th straight quarter of growth, and saw 4 billion digital logins, with 65% of sales now digitally enabled.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Still, CEO Brian Moynihan struck a cautious tone, noting that “we potentially face a changing economy in the future.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Citigroup posted first-quarter 2025 net income of $4.1 billion, or $1.96 per share, on $21.6 billion in revenue — a 3% increase from a year ago. Growth was broad-based across all five core businesses, with standout performances in the markets and wealth divisions.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">U.S. personal banking revenue rose 2% to $5.2 billion, powered by gains in branded cards and retail banking, though partially offset by a drop in retail services. Net interest income climbed 6%, fueled by loan growth in branded cards and wider deposit spreads in its retail banking.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Johnson &amp; Johnson beat Wall Street expectations in the first quarter, reporting adjusted earnings per share of $2.77 on revenue of $21.89 billion. Sales of cancer drug Darzalex jumped 20% year over year to $3.24 billion, helping drive 4.2% growth in the company’s “innovative medicine” segment.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The healthcare giant raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $91.6 billion and $92.4 billion, reflecting the impact of its Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition and the addition of Caplyta, a treatment for bipolar depression. However, adjusted EPS guidance held steady at $10.50 to $10.70 as the company factors in tariffs, deal-related costs, and currency headwinds.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">J&amp;J also moved to reverse $7 billion previously set aside for talc-related legal settlements, after courts rejected its bankruptcy-based strategy for resolving lawsuits over its discontinued baby powder. The company maintains the claims are without merit and says it will defend them in state courts.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">During a television appearance on Monday, former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that Trump’s economic strategy is eroding global trust in U.S. financial assets, with volatility in Treasury yields reflecting broad investor unease.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Treasury yields continued to climb on Tuesday, with the 10-year yield reaching 4.43%, as investors reacted to ongoing trade tensions and concerns over inflation. The bond market’s volatility has raised questions about the long-term stability of U.S. financial assets.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 added about 0.8% on Monday, while the Nasdaq climbed about 0.6%. All three indexes briefly slipped into the red before rebounding, buoyed by tech stocks after the Trump administration <a class="link" data-rapid_p="36" data-ylk="slk:issued a surprise tariff exemption;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://qz.com/trump-tariff-exemptions-china-apple-microsoft-nvidia-1851775941" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">issued a surprise tariff exemption</a>.
