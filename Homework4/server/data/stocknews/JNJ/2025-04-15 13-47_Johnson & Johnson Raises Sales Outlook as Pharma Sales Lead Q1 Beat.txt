Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) opened the pharmaceutical earnings season on Tuesday by boosting its full-year sales forecast after posting stronger-than-expected first-quarter results. The announcement comes as the industry prepares for potential tariff shifts under the Trump administration. The New Jersey-based company reported adjusted earnings of $2.77 per share, beating estimates by $0.19. Revenue came in at $21.9 billion, roughly 2% higher than a year ago and ahead of the $21.57 billion analyst forecast. JNJ's pharmaceutical division drove the upside, generating $13.9 billion in revenue, surpassing the $13.4 billion consensus. Key products included Darzalex, which brought in $3.2 billion a 20% year-over-year increase and Xarelto, which generated $690 million, 33% above last year. Meanwhile, sales of Stelara declined 34% to $1.6 billion as generics enter the market, and Invega Sustenna dropped 15% to $903 million. MedTech performance was mixed. Cardiovascular sales climbed 16% to $2.1 billion, while orthopedics and electrophysiology posted modest declines. Despite some pressure from product-specific declines, Johnson & Johnson raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $91.0 billion and $91.8 billion. The company attributed the change in part to the addition of Caplyta following its acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Johnson & Johnson forecasts about $400 million in costs this year related to tariffs on medical devices, said Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk in an interview. Wolk said the estimated costs represent a "worst-case scenario" and take into account President Trump‚Äôs 90-day pause, China's retaliatory tariffs and the resumption of the U.S. tariffs. J&J isn't doing anything differently yet in response to tariffs, Wolk added. üîé Boeing (BA): Beijing ordered Chinese airlines not to place new orders for Boeing jets and is requiring carriers to seek approval before taking delivery of aircraft they have already ordered. üîé Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): The healthcare company raised its 2025 sales guidance, but held its earnings outlook. Citigroup (C) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of 6.52% and 1.95%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 2025. Do the numbers hold clues to what lies ahead for the stock? The headline numbers for Bank of America (BAC) give insight into how the company performed in the quarter ended March 2025, but it may be worthwhile to compare some of its key metrics to Wall Street estimates and the year-ago actuals. Johnson & Johnson stock fell alongside the broader market, despite beating first-quarter calls and hiking its 2025 sales guidance. While the top- and bottom-line numbers for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) give a sense of how the business performed in the quarter ended March 2025, it could be worth looking at how some of its key metrics compare to Wall Street estimates and year-ago values. LVMH‚Äôs latest sales figures show Chinese and U.S. demand for luxury goods was wobbly‚Äîeven before the trade war between the two countries kicked off in earnest. Shares in Louis Vuitton's owner sank Tuesday, after the company said sales fell 3% over the three months through March compared with a year earlier. The pullback meant LVMH lost its crown as Europe‚Äôs most valuable luxury company to Herm√®s, which reports later this week. Bank of America and Citigroup said consumer spending ticked higher in the first quarter, when concerns about the economy began to bubble up. PNC's first-quarter 2025 results reflect a rise in fee income and NII. Yet, increased expenses act as headwinds. Citi and Bank of America posted first-quarter net interest income of $14 billion and $14.4 billion, respectively. Wall Street expected $14.49 billion of NII for the quarter at BofA, according to data compiled by FactSet, and $13.56 billion at Citi. BofA said in January that it expected to drive between $14.5 billion and $14.6 billion of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the first quarter.
