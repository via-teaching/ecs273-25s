And Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani joins us now with the very latest, Anj.</p>, <p class="type-body-md-reg yf-rtg296">That's right, Josh. And we know that of course, tariffs are top of mind for the entire pharma sector as, we know, we heard the announcement from the administration yesterday about the specific pharmaceutical tariffs. Uh, Johnson &amp; Johnson sort of bridges two gaps. It's it also sells medical devices and that includes to China. So that is where a lot of the impact comes from for the business. Just taking a quick look at the earnings, they did beat on both the revenue as well as earnings per share, but that doesn't seem to really have helped their stock. It's been trading largely flat, but, you know, slightly negative all day long. And that's because Wall Street is still waiting to hear about the final impacts. We took a look at what they said during the earnings call and they said they were expecting about $400 million in terms of impact and that's largely coming from those medical devices. I had a chance to catch up with CFO Joe Wolk earlier today and here's what he had to say specifically about where that $400 million is coming from. Take a listen.</p>, <p class="type-body-md-reg yf-rtg296">The tariffs that we've included in that 400 million relate to products that are not exempt under USMCA, some of the aluminum and steel tariffs that currently exist and apply to our MedTech products, and then the China tariffs, both, uh, uh, from China as well as the retaliatory, uh, tariffs that China had levied upon us. That last piece makes up probably about 70% of the total $400 million. So those are products of origin here in the US being shipped to China, and that's the impact that we we actually have. So we'll have to see with respect to pharmaceutical tariffs.</p>, <p class="type-body-md-reg yf-rtg296">So they're still waiting like the rest of the industry for the rest of the, you know, the other shoe to drop, essentially. And that's where things stand right now for, uh, for the medical devices. Uh, we've seen analyst notes all day talking about how they have less protection, uh, from China in particular, but also the Mexico, Canada, as you as they mentioned, or as he mentioned earlier, about the steel and aluminum there. Uh, looking at what's ahead and how to sort of, you know, wait for everything else to fall out for the year, I asked him how he's thinking about this, in particular how to, you know, run the company knowing that the the situation is still kind of fluid. And here's what Joe had to say.</p>, <p class="type-body-md-reg yf-rtg296">My only role, I guess, as CFO at this point would be to look at the profitability of business. If these tariffs continue to escalate, then you just have to make decisions like we would in any other part of our business. And we're currently doing within our orthopedics and surgery portfolio, rationalizing skews that are on the less profitable and perhaps even unprofitable side, in either certain markets or certain product portfolios. And that would be no different.</p>, <p class="type-body-md-reg yf-rtg296">So, as you can see, just looking at, uh, you know, rationalizing the business, and this is already impacting the company, the first of the major pharmaceuticals to report in this quarter. So we'll just have to wait and see how the rest stack up by comparison.</p>, <p class="type-body-md-reg yf-rtg296">All right, thank you, Anj. Appreciate it.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">Johnson &amp; Johnson forecasts about $400 million in costs this year related to tariffs on medical devices, said Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk in an interview.  Wolk said the estimated costs represent a "worst-case scenario" and take into account President Trump’s 90-day pause, China's retaliatory tariffs and the resumption of the U.S. tariffs.  J&amp;J isn't doing anything differently yet in response to tariffs, Wolk added.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">HP (HPQ) concluded the recent trading session at $23.74, signifying a -1.25% move from its prior day's close.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">US benchmark equity indexes were little changed intraday as companies continued to report financial</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">In the most recent trading session, Eli Lilly (LLY) closed at $757.18, indicating a +0.38% shift from the previous trading day.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">Veeva Systems (VEEV) closed the most recent trading day at $222.72, moving -0.42% from the previous trading session.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">ASML reported lower-than-expected orders, citing weakness in the chip sector. The Dutch company reported bookings of 3.94 billion ($4.47 billion) in the three months through March, lower than the average analyst expectation of 4.82 billion. ASML is the sole producer of cutting-edge lithography machines used by semiconductor companies like TSMC to make advanced chips.
