These events occurred alongside solid earnings reports, with a significant rise in net income and earnings per share compared to the previous year. While the company's stock price increased by 6.64% over the last quarter, the broader market also trended upward, climbing 5.9% in the past year. These company developments likely complemented the overall market movements and investor sentiment, rather than diverging from broader trends.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-rapid_p="12" data-ylk="slk:You should learn about the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Johnson &amp; Johnson.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://simplywall.st/company/id/f8f92af2-8452-4ce8-b374-906eb8af2a37?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;blueprint=3751633" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">You should learn about the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Johnson &amp; Johnson.</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-rapid_p="14" data-ylk="slk:Outshine the giants: these 25 early-stage AI stocks could fund your retirement.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434414/ai-penny-stocks/global?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=conclusion-grid&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;blueprint=3751633" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Outshine the giants: these 25 early-stage AI stocks could fund your retirement.</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Johnson &amp; Johnson's recent dividend increase and positive Phase 3 clinical data for icotrokinra could significantly bolster investor confidence by enhancing perceptions of future earnings potential and revenue growth. The company's total return, including dividends, was 17.11% over the past five years, indicating steady but moderate financial performance. This is set against the backdrop of a one-year underperformance relative to the US Pharmaceuticals industry's 7% decline.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Looking forward, these announcements could positively influence earnings forecasts, especially with expected boosts from TREMFYA and RYBREVANT within the Innovative Medicine segment. This aligns with strategic acquisitions and product launches that have been projected to grow revenue and expand market footprint. Despite these gains, competition and economic pressures remain considerations, particularly in international markets like China.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Currently trading at US$150, the share price reflects a modest discount to the analyst consensus price target of US$171.11. This implies potential upside and suggests market expectations are still reconciling with Johnson &amp; Johnson's future growth prospects. Revenue and earnings forecasts will likely incorporate these developments, while still being mindful of existing risks such as biosimilar competition and macroeconomic pressures.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-rapid_p="15" data-ylk="slk:Review our historical performance report to gain insights into Johnson &amp; Johnson's track record.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://simplywall.st/company/id/f8f92af2-8452-4ce8-b374-906eb8af2a37/past?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;blueprint=3751633" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Review our historical performance report to gain insights into Johnson &amp; Johnson's track record.</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your financial situation.

Wolk said the estimated costs represent a "worst-case scenario" and take into account President Trump’s 90-day pause, China's retaliatory tariffs and the resumption of the U.S. tariffs.  J&amp;J isn't doing anything differently yet in response to tariffs, Wolk added.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch.

The administration announced earlier it would conduct an investigation into drug imports. That move is widely seen as a first step toward imposing new levies. Earnings and revenue both beat estimates for the quarter.
