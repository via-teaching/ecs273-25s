We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Reveals Details Of Trump’s Tariff Negotiations & Discusses 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.
In his recent appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the supply chain disruption that firms were facing and planning for in the wake of President Trump’s tariffs. “I think that this was the week where people said I better have an alternative supply chain, I just have to. Wherever it is, which is going to hurt the gross margins,” Cramer said.
Cramer also linked the current supply chain disruptions to the one that businesses faced during the coronavirus pandemic. Cramer mentioned an unnamed CEO who had prepared for the current disruption by learning lessons from COVID. According to Cramer:
“I’m speaking to a major CEO, at a major tech company who said, do you think that we didn’t learn anything from COVID? COVID was a total shutdown [in] China and we learned to move away from China. And China misjudged what we learned during COVID.”
The conversation then shifted to President Trump’s negotiations with America’s trading partners. While most media attention has focused on China, he mentioned negotiations with Japan and South Korea. Starting with Japan, Cramer outlined:
“I was talking to someone who has been in on the Japanese negotiations. And I asked for color. And he said, they’re color-full. But that someone’s playing very hardball, in our country, and I presume, that someone is, obviously our President. And I said, does he know that you are our friends, and he just didn’t respond. I thought it was interesting.”
As for Korea, he believes that the country is the Trump administration’s favorite due to its already sizable manufacturing presence in the US. Cramer shared:
“My answer on Korea is, that. . . they are loved. . . Okay, so Korea builds plants here right, and they are not the plants like the Germans they are not assembly plants, they make everything here, so they are brought up, constantly as the paradigm, like why can’t you guys be like Korea? Where all the intellectual property is made here. And I think it’s rather amazing. . .I brought them up as being why are they getting a free ride to some people? And they said no, there’s no free ride, they actually listened to what we wanted.”
Of course, since China is the President’s first target when it comes to negotiations, it was unsurprising that the country came up. Cramer isn’t a fan of China. What amazed Cramer was Hayman Capital Management founder and CIO, Kyle Bass’s comments where he outlined “one country lies, one country doesn’t. . .China lies. Look I find these talks unfathomable. I don’t see any progress.”
As for who has the cards in the negotiations between the US and China, Cramer said: “Well, that’s the problem. We don’t know.”

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a well-known healthcare company. The tariff-induced selloff in growth stocks and in those that have exposure to China has translated into tailwinds for the firm. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)’s shares are up by 7.9% year-to-date as investors have flocked to firms with domestic US exposure. In his previous comments about the firm, Cramer said that the market is operating in a forgiving environment for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Here are his latest thoughts:
“You said it yourself like JNJ, the thing that. . .didn’t save their quarter, but what made it so that you kind of liked it is the weak dollar. So remember most of these companies are like wow, bring it down . . . the companies themselves are very pro weak dollar. So when you speak to them offline, they love it.”
