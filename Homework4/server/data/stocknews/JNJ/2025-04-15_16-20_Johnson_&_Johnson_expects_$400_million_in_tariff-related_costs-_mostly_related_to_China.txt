The most substantial impact comes from tariffs against China and retaliatory tariffs from China, said Joseph Wolk, Johnson &amp; Johnson's chief financial officer, in a conference call with analysts following the company's latest earnings results.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The company's estimate also includes the impact from tariffs on aluminum and steel, along with tariffs against key U.S. trading partners Canada and Mexico. Johnson &amp; Johnson said that contractual agreements already in place limit its leverage on price increases that could potentially soften the impact.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The cost estimate does not include possible tariffs on imports of pharmaceuticals. The Trump administration has launched an investigation into imports of pharmaceuticals, which is a step towards imposing tariffs.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Tariffs, especially on pharmaceutical products, could lead to supply chain issues and shortages, said CEO Joaquin Duato.

The muted open followed Monday’s tech-led rally, which briefly masked deeper market jitters tied to tariffs and macro uncertainty.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">Johnson &amp; Johnson is holding its earnings outlook steady despite President Donald Trump signaling he could put tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry. The administration announced earlier it would conduct an investigation into drug imports. That move is widely seen as a first step toward imposing new levies. Earnings and revenue both beat estimates for the quarter. Johnson &amp; Johnson CFO Joe Wolk joined Bloomberg Open Interest to talk about how tariffs could hit the industry and the drug maker's bottom line.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">Insurance bellwether Travelers' first-quarter profit exceeded analysts' expectations on Wednesday, as strong underwriting gains helped soften the hit from over $2 billion of catastrophe losses driven by the Los Angeles wildfires.  The results shed a light on the fallout from one of the costliest natural disasters in California's history, which claimed several lives and destroyed property, with some estimates pegging the economic losses at $250 billion.  Travelers' catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, touched a record $2.27 billion for the quarter ended March 31, compared with $712 million a year earlier.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), on Tuesday, reported a first-quarter 2025 adjusted EPS of $2.77, up 2.2% year over year, beating the consensus of $2.60.

Innovative Medicine sales increased 2.3% or 4.2 operationally to $13.90 billion.
