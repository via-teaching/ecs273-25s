Content: The latest monthly report from OPEC shows that the cartel has revised its global oil demand growth forecast for 2025 downward for the first time since December, now projecting an increase of 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) — 150,000 bpd less than previous estimates. The revision stems largely from slower-than-expected consumption and new U.S. tariffs that have rattled trade dynamics and economic sentiment globally. As President Trump ramps up tariff measures, including a 125% levy on Chinese imports, investors are growing increasingly wary about how this might dampen energy demand, particularly in emerging markets.Despite these geopolitical headwinds, oil prices remain relatively steady, with WTI crude hovering over $60 per barrel. However, volatility is high. Crude futures are down more than 10% so far this month, largely on fears that slowing global trade and rising supply will pressure prices. Against this backdrop, it may be wise for investors to adopt a more defensive approach—one that focuses on large, resilient players likeChevronCVX,ConocoPhillipsCOP, andEOG ResourcesEOG. These companies have the scale, balance sheets, and capital discipline to navigate turbulence, making them safer bets in uncertain times. OPEC’s cautious tone isn’t just based on oil-specific fundamentals. The group’s Monthly Oil Market Report also trimmed its global economic growth outlook for 2025 to 3.0%, from 3.1%, reflecting growing uncertainty in light of the ongoing trade tensions. The U.S. economy is forecasted to expand by 2.1% in 2025, while growth in the Eurozone and China is expected to slow to 0.8% and 4.6%, respectively. These projections imply weaker industrial activity and transport fuel demand—the key drivers of global oil consumption.OECD nations are forecast to contribute a mere 40,000 bpd to demand growth in 2025, while non-OECD countries, traditionally the growth engine, are expected to add around 1.25 million bpd. However, these numbers could fall if trade tensions and inflation continue to hurt energy use by consumers and businesses. On the supply front, OPEC’s report showed that the broader OPEC+ group reduced output slightly in March, with total production falling by 37,000 bpd to 41.02 million bpd. Cuts from Nigeria and Iraq offset gains from Kazakhstan, which continues to exceed its output cap. However, OPEC+ is scheduled to increase output again in May, raising questions about how the additional barrels will be absorbed in a softer demand environment.Meanwhile, non-OPEC supply growth has also been revised down. OPEC now expects non-OPEC+ liquids production to rise by 900,000 bpd in 2025—100,000 bpd less than previously forecast. Most of this increase is still expected to come from the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. However, with U.S. shale growth slowing and cost inflation a growing concern, the global supply outlook looks slightly more balanced than a month ago.
