A dealmaking freeze and the biggest stocks rout since 2023 are raising the stakes for Wall Street’s earnings season Crude oil is off to a weak start in 2025, falling more than 15% so far this year. On Monday, prices fell below $60 a barrel — the lowest since 2021. The decline came as fears of a global recession grow and OPEC+ surprised markets by speeding up the end of production cuts. Making things worse, Saudi Arabia also sharply lowered its official selling prices, adding more pressure to an already shaky market. Given this uncertainty, investors may find stability in large-cap, high-yield energy stocks like Kinder Morgan KMI, Canadian Natural Resources Limited CNQ, Chevron CVX and , which offer steady dividends and resilience against market swings. A storm is brewing in the global energy markets as intensifying trade disputes and an unexpected surge in oil supply send shockwaves through investor sentiment. The Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs—ranging from 10% to 34% on key trade partners—are already prompting downward revisions to global growth forecasts. As countries like China gear up to retaliate, U.S. energy exports are squarely in the crosshairs, raising concerns over weakened industrial output and softer fuel demand worldwide.Adding to the strain, OPEC+ stunned markets by announcing a crude production hike of 411,000 barrels per day for May—three times more than anticipated. Major producers, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, are ramping up output just as economic uncertainty is clouding demand prospects. With ample spare capacity and the potential for a growing surplus later this year, the risk of prolonged oversupply is rising, threatening recent price stability.In a further sign of market softness, Saudi Arabia slashed its flagship crude prices by the steepest margin in over two years, underscoring the mounting pressure on oil benchmarks like Brent. The combination of geopolitical friction and supply-side shocks is setting the stage for a volatile chapter in global energy markets.

These companies—each with a market cap over $10 billion—are built on steady cash flows and durable business models that help weather the volatility of commodity cycles.
