OPEC and its allies have revised their oil demand projectionsdownward for both 2025 and 2026, citing mounting global trade tensions and tariffs as key risks to economic growth.
The group now expects global crude demand to rise by 1.3 million barrels per day over the next two years roughly 150,000 barrels per day lower than previous forecasts. OPEC+ also adjusted its global GDP growth outlook, trimming expectations to 3% for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026, each down by 0.1 percentage point.
The global economy showed a steady growth trend at the beginning of the year, the organization said in its monthly oil market report. However, recent trade-related dynamics have introduced higher uncertainty to the short-term global economic growth outlook.
Among the factors behind the downgrade, OPEC+ pointed to U.S. President Donald Trump's newly imposed 145% tariffs on China the world's largest crude oil importer as a significant headwind for energy demand.
Despite the lowered outlook, the oil-producing bloc has agreed to ramp up output starting in May. Analysts warn this move could flood the market with excess supply at a time when consumption is weakening.
Since the tariff announcement on April 2, oil prices have fallen sharply. Brent crude is currently trading around $64.68 per barrel, down 13% since the start of the month and off another 1% on April 14.
Major oil producers have not been spared. Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Shell (NYSE:SHEL), and BP (NYSE:BP) have all seen their shares drop over 10% in the past month.
