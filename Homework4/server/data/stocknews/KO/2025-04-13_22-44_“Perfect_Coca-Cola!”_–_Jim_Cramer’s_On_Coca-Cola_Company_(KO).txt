In this article, we are going to take a look at where Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, described the 145% duty on China as so extreme that it essentially acts as an embargo rather than a conventional tariff.</p>, <p class="yf-1ba2ufg">“We now have 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, a number that high frankly isn’t really a tariff. It’s more of an embargo. Almost nobody’s gonna pay that much of a markup. It’s a recipe for losing money.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><b>READ ALSO </b><a class="link" data-rapid_p="12" data-ylk="slk:10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-stocks-on-jim-cramers-radar-recently-2-1505060/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><b>10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently</b></a><b> and </b><a class="link" data-rapid_p="13" data-ylk="slk:Jim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/jim-cramer-talked-about-these-8-stocks-2-1504690/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><b>Jim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks</b></a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Cramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump’s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. “As a nation, shamefully, we’ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,” he said</p>, <p class="yf-1ba2ufg">“I think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Cramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. “Yes, we have to take them on now or never,” he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept.</p>, <p class="yf-1ba2ufg">“So the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it’s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it’s not worth it to go back… [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I’m actually thinking that might be where we’</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (<strong><a class="link" data-rapid_p="15" data-ylk="slk:see more details here;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">see more details here</a></strong>).</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><b><i>Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81</i></b></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) produces nonalcoholic drinks that include soft drinks, water, tea, juice, and plant-based options. It also supplies beverage concentrates and syrups for sale through retail channels. During the episode, Cramer stated, “Utility, Verizon, perfect Coca-Cola, Waste Management. Yeah, these are timeless.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">On March 31, during an episode of Squawk on the Street, Cramer mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and said:</p>, <p class="yf-1ba2ufg">“In terms of shorting, like if you wanna short, do you short Coca-Cola? No, cause Coca-Cola in 2000, after the NASDAQ broke, was really a terrific stock to own… Look at that April 14th to April 17th 2000 period when we had this dramatic switch. Which was rather incredible, which was the fastest I’ve seen where Coca-Cola went from being a loser to a winner. I think we’re there. Coca-Cola’s having a good quarter.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Overall, KO <strong><b>ranks 7th</b></strong> on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of KO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.
