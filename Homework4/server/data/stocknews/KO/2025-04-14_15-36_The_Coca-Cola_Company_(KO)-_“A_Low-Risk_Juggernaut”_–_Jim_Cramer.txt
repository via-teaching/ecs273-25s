In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">On Thursday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer cautioned viewers about what may lie ahead once the 90-day pause on new tariffs comes to an end. While discussing the latest Consumer Price Index report, Cramer acknowledged that the numbers looked favorable, with inflation appearing relatively tame and even some categories experiencing actual price declines. He pointed to energy prices, saying, “The best, anything it touched energy, which is plummeting.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><b>READ ALSO: </b><a class="link" data-rapid_p="12" data-ylk="slk:Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/jim-cramer-discussed-these-12-stocks-1506794/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><b>Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks</b></a><b> and </b><a class="link" data-rapid_p="13" data-ylk="slk:10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-stocks-on-jim-cramers-radar-recently-2-1505060/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><b>10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently</b></a>.</p>, <p class="yf-1ba2ufg">“This is essentially an embargo. President Trump’s ecstatic that the tariffs are already taking in $2 billion a day. He’s thrilled that supposedly 75 countries are begging for something more reasonable than the 90-day pause when the 90-day pause comes to an end.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">According to Cramer, President Trump is “ecstatic” that these tariffs are already generating $2 billion a day in revenue and is thrilled about 75 countries “supposedly” asking for something more workable once the 90-day grace period concludes. Despite the seemingly positive revenue flow, Cramer expressed concern over the broader consequences. He pointed out that many Americans have yet to grasp the full impact of trade policies that have allowed foreign businesses to flood U.S. markets with inexpensive products, often pricing out domestic companies.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">While many consumers embraced the lower costs, Cramer reminded his audience that it came at the expense of American jobs. “Now we’re going to have to pay a price. He stressed that consumers should be prepared to pay significantly more for a wide range of goods. He said that the additional cost largely will likely benefit foreign companies, which will hike prices in response to the tariffs imposed on them. He clarified his position by stating he is not a staunch advocate of free trade for its own sake. “No other country plays by the rules on trade, so we shouldn’t either,” he said but cautioned:</p>, <p class="yf-1ba2ufg">“We just have to be more thoughtful about this or we’ll end up doing more harm than good. Again, as someone who wants fair trade, not free trade, I am rooting for the president to pull this off, but not at the expense of great American companies that have done nothing wrong and are the best in the world.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (<strong><a class="link" data-rapid_p="15" data-ylk="slk:see more details here;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">see more details here</a></strong>).</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">A row of factory workers assembling bottles of sparkling soft drinks on a conveyor belt.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><b><i>Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81</i></b></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">A caller asked what Cramer thought of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and he replied:</p>, <p class="yf-1ba2ufg">“I love that…. James Quincey is terrific. It’s got a good dividend. It’s really well run. It’s got an international presence… and it’s doing well in this environment. You have a winner.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that offers a wide variety of nonalcoholic drinks. Its products include soft drinks, water, tea, juice, plant-based options, concentrates, and syrups for retail use. In February, Cramer said:</p>, <p class="yf-1ba2ufg">“… Sometimes companies can practically print money simply because they’re so well run. Take Coca-Cola. Under the steady hand of James Quincey, Coca-Cola has become a low-risk juggernaut with a solid dividend, definitely a stock that is worth owning.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Overall, KO <strong><b>ranks 3rd</b></strong> on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar. While we acknowledge the potential of KO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.
