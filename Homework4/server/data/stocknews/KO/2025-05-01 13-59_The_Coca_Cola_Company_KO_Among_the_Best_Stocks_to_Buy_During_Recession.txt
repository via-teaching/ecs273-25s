As per BlackRock, 2025 started with a bumpy ride for the US stocks. That being said, the asset manager believes that the sentiment has been a critical driver, but fundamentals seem to be healthy. This makes up for an optimistic longer-run outlook. Despite the tariff shocks creating difficult markets, the firm is constructive in its outlook and opines that volatility is an opportunity to capitalize on stock dispersion. Furthermore, Asia continues to exhibit a diversification opportunity for making investments in the AI theme, with equities providing low correlation to US counterparts.
The trade and tariff uncertainty, which fueled the early-year volatility, advanced at the beginning of Q2 due to the US tariff pronouncements, according to the investment management company. This resulted in a global market meltdown and revived fears related to recession. However, as the quarter progressed, the tariff tensions took a backseat, and there was some optimism visible in the broader US markets. The asset manager believes that, while tariffs remain a critical measure, the potential for market-supporting policies like deregulation and corporate tax cuts provides some room for emergent optimism.
The firm highlighted the importance of an active approach in a bid to capitalize on inefficiencies and to make precise and intentional decisions amidst historic change and transition. While the results of bilateral tariff negotiations remain unpredictable, having a pulse on company dynamics, mainly when the macro picture remains unclear, can act as a differentiator for portfolios.
The firm opines that corporate strength has supported the US equities’ momentum, and it comes through in earnings and market share. As per the firm, relatively pro-industry policies have stimulated healthy FCF. Several companies throughout different time frames have deployed the cash for future business growth. Even though the policy uncertainty in the current time of transition led to the pause in large investment decisions, the company believes that moves toward deregulation and the reshoring of supply chains once policy gets settled can result in the revival of CapEx spending throughout industries, such as technology and industrials. Despite tariffs dominating, the asset manager expects that deregulation and other policy priorities can regain attention. The high drive for innovation is the long-term secular trend that can support the US equities.
