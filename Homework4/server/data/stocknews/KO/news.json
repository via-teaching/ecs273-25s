There are several top stocks offering yields much better than the S&P 500 average of 1.44%, but some of these businesses are struggling competitively and are only offering high yields because their share prices have collapsed.\nIt's ideal to find high-yield stocks of strong companies that are delivering solid financial results and showing share price appreciation potential. Here are two dividend payers that are doing just that.\nCoca-Cola (KO -0.19%) has historically weathered recessions well. It has increased the dividend for 63 consecutive years after recently increasing its quarterly payment by 5% to $0.51. It's a great option for someone looking to boost their portfolio's average yield with relatively low risk.\nCoca-Cola generates a significant portion of its annual revenue from making concentrate syrup for its trademark brand. This is a capital-light business model that churns out robust profits. The company's profit margin has remained above 20% over the last five years. \nDespite choppy consumer spending behavior, global unit case volume grew 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 1% for 2024. The company continues to adjust its marketing strategy and capitalize on its knowledge of local markets globally to drive sales. The company has been particularly effective at linking its beverages to different occasions, such as music or food, that resonate with consumers.\nThe stock has climbed 20% over the last year, and it currently offers a forward dividend yield of 2.88%. Analysts expect Coca-Cola to grow earnings at an annualized rate of 6% over the next several years. Combined with the high yield, investors can expect to earn an average annual return around 9%, which is slightly less than the historical return of the S&P 500 but with the advantage of earning a much higher dividend yield.\nLeading wireless service providers are very resilient in recessions. Eliminating a phone or internet payment plan is probably the last thing people are going to cut in a recession. Shares of AT&T (T -1.85%) have climbed about 59% over the last year, driven by healthy demand for wireless phone plans and high-speed internet service.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nAT&T cut its dividend in 2022 to shore up funds to service its debt. The company's current quarterly dividend is $0.2775, bringing its forward yield to 4.2%. Instead of increasing its dividend, management has left the dividend unchanged as it focuses on paying down debt and investing for growth.\nIt's normal for telecoms to use a lot of debt, since they benefit from regular monthly bills from customers, which provides a high level of certainty for annual revenue and cash flows. The company's debt has declined from $177 billion in 2021 to $123 billion in 2024, while paying out less than half its free cash flow in dividends over the past year.\nAT&T entered 2025 with momentum. It reported 1.7 million postpaid phone net additions last year, which refers to the monthly bills people pay for wireless service. The company also added 1 million AT&T Fiber net additions for the seventh consecutive year. It aims to keep pressure on competitors by focusing on delivering quality service and good deals. \nThe company generated more than $17 billion in free cash flow last year on $122 billion of revenue. The 4.2% forward yield, combined with management's optimism that it can grow AT&T's business to increase the share price, makes this an excellent income investment for 2025 and beyond.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, described the 145% duty on China as so extreme that it essentially acts as an embargo rather than a conventional tariff.\n“We now have 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, a number that high frankly isn’t really a tariff. It’s more of an embargo. Almost nobody’s gonna pay that much of a markup. It’s a recipe for losing money.”\nREAD ALSO 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently and Jim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks\nCramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump’s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. “As a nation, shamefully, we’ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,” he said\n“I think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.”\nCramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. “Yes, we have to take them on now or never,” he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept.\n“So the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it’s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it’s not worth it to go back… [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I’m actually thinking that might be where we’\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) produces nonalcoholic drinks that include soft drinks, water, tea, juice, and plant-based options. It also supplies beverage concentrates and syrups for sale through retail channels. During the episode, Cramer stated, “Utility, Verizon, perfect Coca-Cola, Waste Management. Yeah, these are timeless.”\nOn March 31, during an episode of Squawk on the Street, Cramer mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and said:\n“In terms of shorting, like if you wanna short, do you short Coca-Cola? No, cause Coca-Cola in 2000, after the NASDAQ broke, was really a terrific stock to own… Look at that April 14th to April 17th 2000 period when we had this dramatic switch. Which was rather incredible, which was the fastest I’ve seen where Coca-Cola went from being a loser to a winner. I think we’re there. Coca-Cola’s having a good quarter.”\nOverall, KO ranks 7th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of KO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +3.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.6% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coca-Cola belongs, has gained 1.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCoca-Cola is expected to post earnings of $0.72 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.96 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.19 indicates a change of +8.1% from what Coca-Cola is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Coca-Cola.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Coca-Cola, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $47.99 billion and $50.46 billion estimates indicate +2% and +5.1% changes, respectively.\nCoca-Cola reported revenues of $11.54 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.4%. EPS of $0.55 for the same period compares with $0.49 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.69 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.01%. The EPS surprise was +7.84%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCoca-Cola is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coca-Cola. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar.\nOn Thursday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer cautioned viewers about what may lie ahead once the 90-day pause on new tariffs comes to an end. While discussing the latest Consumer Price Index report, Cramer acknowledged that the numbers looked favorable, with inflation appearing relatively tame and even some categories experiencing actual price declines. He pointed to energy prices, saying, “The best, anything it touched energy, which is plummeting.”\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks and 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Recently.\n“This is essentially an embargo. President Trump’s ecstatic that the tariffs are already taking in $2 billion a day. He’s thrilled that supposedly 75 countries are begging for something more reasonable than the 90-day pause when the 90-day pause comes to an end.”\nAccording to Cramer, President Trump is “ecstatic” that these tariffs are already generating $2 billion a day in revenue and is thrilled about 75 countries “supposedly” asking for something more workable once the 90-day grace period concludes. Despite the seemingly positive revenue flow, Cramer expressed concern over the broader consequences. He pointed out that many Americans have yet to grasp the full impact of trade policies that have allowed foreign businesses to flood U.S. markets with inexpensive products, often pricing out domestic companies.\nWhile many consumers embraced the lower costs, Cramer reminded his audience that it came at the expense of American jobs. “Now we’re going to have to pay a price. He stressed that consumers should be prepared to pay significantly more for a wide range of goods. He said that the additional cost largely will likely benefit foreign companies, which will hike prices in response to the tariffs imposed on them. He clarified his position by stating he is not a staunch advocate of free trade for its own sake. “No other country plays by the rules on trade, so we shouldn’t either,” he said but cautioned:\n“We just have to be more thoughtful about this or we’ll end up doing more harm than good. Again, as someone who wants fair trade, not free trade, I am rooting for the president to pull this off, but not at the expense of great American companies that have done nothing wrong and are the best in the world.”\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA row of factory workers assembling bottles of sparkling soft drinks on a conveyor belt.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\nA caller asked what Cramer thought of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and he replied:\n“I love that…. James Quincey is terrific. It’s got a good dividend. It’s really well run. It’s got an international presence… and it’s doing well in this environment. You have a winner.”\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that offers a wide variety of nonalcoholic drinks. Its products include soft drinks, water, tea, juice, plant-based options, concentrates, and syrups for retail use. In February, Cramer said:\n“… Sometimes companies can practically print money simply because they’re so well run. Take Coca-Cola. Under the steady hand of James Quincey, Coca-Cola has become a low-risk juggernaut with a solid dividend, definitely a stock that is worth owning.”\nOverall, KO ranks 3rd on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar. While we acknowledge the potential of KO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nWarren Buffett is famous because of the long-term success he has achieved running Berkshire Hathaway. But there are two interesting things about this company. First, it is run kind of like a mutual fund. Second, it doesn't pay dividends despite the fact that Buffett often invests in dividend-paying companies. Here's why that matters and why you might want to buy one of these three dividend payers he owns.\nOne of the core tenets of Buffett's investment approach is to buy good companies when they are attractively priced. But the next step is to hold for the long term so he can benefit from the growth of the businesses he buys. One of the nuances that gets lost in this is that he uses the cash generated from the companies he owns outright or owns in Berkshire Hathaway's common stock portfolio to reinvest in his business. That allows him to compound those cash flows over time and this enhances the returns he generates for investors.\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\nFrom a big-picture perspective, you can do the same thing by dividend reinvesting. All it takes is a phone call to your broker, or, more likely, a button press on your broker's website or in its app. And in one quick and easy move you'll be investing more like Warren Buffett.\nBut what if you want to invest even more like Oracle of Omaha? Well, three dividend-paying stocks he owns today are Coca-Cola (KO -0.19%), Chevron (CVX 0.65%), and Kraft Heinz (KHC -2.00%). Here's a look at these three Buffett stocks to see if they'll be a good fit for your Buffett style dividend reinvesting.\nCoca-Cola is a very easy company to like. It is the industry-leading beverage company with a globally diversified business. It is large enough to have economies of scale in distribution, marketing, and research and development, and it can, and does, act as an industry consolidator. The dividend has been increased annually for over five decades, making it a Dividend King. The dividend yield is 2.9%, which is well above the market's yield today.\nFor conservative dividend investors it is a solid choice. The only problem is that the stock looks a little expensive at the moment, with both the price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios above their five-year averages. However, if you are willing to pay a premium for income security, Coca-Cola could be a good fit for your portfolio.\nAnother industry leader in Buffett's portfolio is energy giant Chevron. It is one of the largest integrated energy companies you can buy, with a business that spans from the upstream (energy production) through the midstream (pipelines) and into the downstream (chemicals and refining). This diversification helps to soften the impact of the inherent swings in the commodity-driven energy sector. On top of that, the company has a very strong balance sheet, which allows it to take on leverage during industry downturns to support its business and dividend.\nThe dividend, notably, has been increased annually for 38 years thanks largely to Chevron's solid business model. That said, energy price volatility still has a material impact on the stock price. Right now energy prices are weakening and the dividend yield is a very attractive 4.7%. The yield could go higher if oil prices continue to fall. But the history here suggests that the dividend will continue to get paid even if oil prices continue to fall. You could try to time your entry into Chevron, but the truth is it is a strong energy choice at just about any point of the energy cycle.\nThe last big dividend stock on this list is Kraft Heinz. It is a tough consumer staples stock to love when you compare it to Coca-Cola. Yes, Kraft Heinz's dividend yield is a lofty 5.3%, but the dividend has been static since it was cut in 2019. The big story is the business overhaul that's taking place.\nThe company was created via the merger between Kraft and Heinz. The goal at that time was to cut costs to boost profitability. But cutting costs can only take a company so far before it needs to refocus on growth. That's what Kraft Heinz has been doing, after turning to a new management team. But the results haven't been particularly impressive, which is why the dividend has been stuck in neutral for so long. If you consider this high-yield food maker you'll need to go in understanding that it is a turnaround story that will require extra monitoring. It's probably only appropriate for more aggressive investors.\nWhile Buffett owns Coca-Cola, Chevron, and Kraft Heinz in his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, you don't actually need to own these specific stocks to benefit from dividend reinvestment. These are just three stocks to get you thinking about the real investment tool that's important here, which is the reinvestment of dividends so you can compound your returns over time -- just like Buffett does with his investments.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chevron wasn’t one of them.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.\nKey Points\nCoca-Cola (KO -0.19%) is a famous company with an iconic brand known the world over. Operating in the consumer staples space, consumers tend to keep buying its products right through periods of stock market and economic turmoil. That's how Coca-Cola has managed to support and grow its dividend through the years despite often material headwinds.\nWhile Coca-Cola is an elite company, it is far from the only consumer staples maker that can help you rest easy amid stock market unrest. Here are a few others.\nIf the stock market falls into a bear market are you going to stop buying toothpaste, toilet paper, and soda? If the economy succumbs to a recession, will you stop using soap, laundry detergent, and food? That answer, I hope, to those two questions is no. And this is why consumer staples makers are so attractive during troubled times (if not all the time).\nImage source: Getty Images.\nMany of the products that companies like Coca-Cola sell aren't actually necessities. In this case you could just drink tap water instead of soda. However, the cost of most consumer staples products is fairly modest while the benefits are material, even if those benefits are really just emotional. Brand loyalty tends to run high in the consumer staples niche. Even better, consumer staples products are bought frequently because they get used regularly.\nIf you are having trouble sleeping at night amid market uncertainty, you should consider adding some more consumer staples stocks to your portfolio mix.\nCoca-Cola is a solid choice for highly conservative investors. It has an above-market dividend yield of 2.9% backed by a dividend that has been increased annually for more than 50 years, making this beverage giant a Dividend King. The company has a global distribution network, strong R&D skills, and massive marketing heft. The only problem is that the stock looks a little expensive right now, with its price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios both above their five-year averages. If you're willing to pay up for safety, you might want to buy Coca-Cola.\nBut beverage peer PepsiCo (PEP -1.88%) has similar business strengths and a more diversified portfolio that includes snacks and packaged foods. It is also a Dividend King. However, the real attraction lies in its valuation, with PepsiCo's P/S and P/E ratios both below their five-year averages. Its dividend yield is an even higher 3.7%. And with PepsiCo investing in growth through bolt-on acquisitions, it is continuing to grow its business with the same playbook that has worked well for more than five decades.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nThat said, you might want something a little different. Unilever (UL 0.61%) could be just what you are looking for, with its portfolio of consumer products and food. The big story with Unilever is that North America and Europe only make up around 40% of its top line, with the rest coming from Latin America and Asia, where economic growth is expected to be higher over the long term. Add in a 3.1% dividend yield and this is an attractive consumer staples option for those with a more adventurous bent.\nThen there are ultra high yielders like Altria (MO -0.40%) and British American Tobacco (BTI -1.21%). Both of these cigarette makers are facing material long-term headwinds as the volume of the cigarettes they sell has been in decline for years. However, smokers tend to be very loyal and often increase their use of cigarettes during uncertain times. During the coronavirus pandemic, both Altria and British American Tobacco put up their strongest volume numbers in years.\nWhile these two tobacco companies come with material long-term risks, the short-term benefit of collecting Altria's 7.2% yield and British American Tobacco's 7.5% yield might be worth it for some investors. Given the nature of cigarettes, those lofty yields are likely to be safe over the near term.\nAlthough all of the companies listed here are attractive in their own way, the list is hardly exhaustive. There are many more consumer staples stocks that are worth looking at if you are worried about the market and fear a recession. While there is no way to fully avoid the impact of either of these big-picture events, buying companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Unilever, Altria, and British American Tobacco can help ease your worries and let you rest a little better thanks to their reliable businesses and dividends.\n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

Goldman Sachs has hiked its recession probability a few times in recent weeks, bumping it from 20% all the way to 45%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan is even more bearish. Its recession model sees a nearly 80% chance the economy goes into a recession, up from 60% not long ago. \nRecessions tend to cause corporate profits to decline, which drives many companies to cut costs through layoffs and other initiatives. Some companies will even cut or suspend their dividend payments to shareholders to conserve cash. \nHowever, other companies are more recession-resistant due to the durability of their cash flows and the strength of their balance sheets. ExxonMobil (XOM 1.04%) and Coca-Cola (KO -0.19%) have proven their ability to weather recessions over the decades. They've both increased their dividends throughout at least the past four recessions. There's a good chance they can withstand the next one with similar ease. \n\nXOM Dividend data by YCharts. Gray bars are recessions.\nExxonMobil hiked its dividend payment by 4% earlier this year, extending its streak to 42 years of annual payment increases. \"We're proud of the fact that we've increased our annual dividend per share for 42 years in a row, something only 4% of S&P 500 companies can claim,\" stated CFO Kathy Mikells during the oil giant's fourth-quarter earnings conference call. She continued, \"And we plan for that track record to continue for decades to come, which is only possible by investing in the high-quality growth opportunities that drive leading returns and higher cash flows.\" \nThe energy company has been investing heavily in transforming its business to dramatically improve its underlying earnings power while also expanding into lower-carbon energy. This strategy has boosted its earnings capacity by nearly $14 billion over the past five years on a constant price and margin basis. Exxon plans to invest over $140 billion into major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program through 2030, which, along with structural cost savings, should add another $20 billion to its annual earnings capacity. \nThat incremental income will give Exxon even more fuel to grow its dividend, which is already on an incredibly safe foundation. Last year, Exxon produced $34.4 billion in free cash flow, easily covering its $16.7 billion dividend outlay. Meanwhile, it has a fortress balance sheet with an ultra-low 6% leverage ratio and a massive $23.2 billion cash balance. These factors put the oil giant's 3.8%-yielding dividend on a rock-solid foundation that should continue withstanding recessions. \nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nCoca-Cola boosted its dividend payment by 5.2% earlier this year. That extended its dividend growth streak to 63 straight years. That raise kept Coca-Cola in the ultra-elite group of Dividend Kings, companies with 50 or more years of annual dividend increases. \nThe company has benefited from the durable and growing demand for its beverage brands. Its portfolio features multiple billion-dollar brands that generate lots of free cash flow for the company. Coca-Cola expects to produce $9.5 billion in free cash flow this year, more than enough to cover its dividend outlay ($8.4 billion last year). The company also has a strong cash-rich balance sheet ($12.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments) with leverage at the low end of its target range. \nCoca-Cola's long-term target is to organically grow its revenue by 4%-6% annually, which should drive mid-to-high single-digit earnings-per-share growth. Meanwhile, the company can enhance its growth rate by making accretive acquisitions. That puts it in a strong position to continue increasing its 2.9%-yielding dividend. \nExxon and Coca-Cola have increased their dividends every year for several decades, which includes the last four recessions. They're in excellent positions to continue raising their payout during the next downturn, whether that happens later this year or further in the future. Because of that, they're great dividend stocks to buy for a durable passive income stream. \n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in ExxonMobil, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ExxonMobil wasn’t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (NASDAQ:CCEP) stands against other best performing European stocks to invest in.\nThe world economy is hanging by a thread, as the macroeconomic environment consists of trade wars, retaliatory tariffs, and political unrest in Ukraine and the Middle East. It adds to economic uncertainty, with market experts offering cautious economic forecasts. According to EY, the euro area will experience a modest economic turnaround in 2025, and growth is expected to increase from 0.7% last year to 1.3% and 1.8% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. It is forecasted to simmer down to 1.4% in 2027. Among all European countries, Malta is projected to experience the highest GDP growth in 2025 at 4%. EY expects soft employment growth across Europe, driven by demographic challenges and subdued labor demand. Unemployment will likely remain at 2024 levels. While nominal wage this year will clock in higher than pre-pandemic levels, wage growth will take a hit. Central and Eastern European countries are forecasted to experience relatively higher inflation in 2025, while the overall rate remains just over 2% in the euro area.\nMeanwhile, German economic institutes have slashed their growth projections for 2025 to 0.1% from the previous forecast of 0.8% in September 2024. This revised estimate does not incorporate the recent tariffs levied by the US. These tariffs will be a major setback for European economies, possibly toppling them over the edge of recession for the third consecutive year. The new conservative government declared a €500 billion fund to improve infrastructure and defence and stimulate growth. The fiscal package enhances the economic outlook for 2026 and 2027.\nHowever, as the United States is feeling the pressure from high valuations and growing political instability, analysts are looking towards Europe as a better bet for stock investors. Analysts point towards Europe offering a more stable outlook, with lower stock prices, clearer policy direction, and even potential interest rate cuts on the horizon. Investors seem to be shifting their focus, partly because the threat of US tariffs on Europe, especially on automobiles, feels less uncertain now that details are clearer. There is also less exposure to tech in Europe, which is seen as a good thing right now. Europe’s markets, with just 10% tech exposure in the Europe 600 compared to 30% in the broader market, look more balanced.\nWith solid earnings, rising share buybacks, and cheaper stock valuations, investors are turning to Europe. Experts suggest that European and UK markets now have their best shot in years at outperforming the US. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the best-performing stocks in Europe so far in 2025.\nA woman pouring a freshly made beverage from a large-scale bottling line.\nTo compile our list of the top performing European stocks this year, used the Finviz screener, applying filters for the region and a market cap of over 10 billion to identify stable European companies. Next, we applied a performance filter and selected 11 European stocks with the highest YTD share price growth as of April 11. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 24\nYTD Share Price Performance as of April 11: 13.13%\nCoca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (NASDAQ:CCEP) is a UK-based company that manufactures, bottles, and distributes soft drinks, energy drinks, water, juices, tea, and coffee, featuring popular brands like Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Monster, Schweppes, and Minute Maid. CCEP ranks 10th on our list of the best performing stocks in Europe.\nOn April 8, Bernstein maintained a Market Perform rating on Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (NASDAQ:CCEP) and lifted the price target to $84.5 from $82, citing strong fundamentals and consistent dividends. The investment firm expects 10% EPS growth because of cost savings and a lucrative product mix at CCEP, though short-term debts exceed liquid assets.\nCoca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (NASDAQ:CCEP) reported its Q4 2024 results on February 14, 2025. The company announced a full-year revenue of €20.7 billion, reflecting an increase of 3.5% year-over-year, while operating profit rose by 8% to €2.7 billion. The company recorded a free cash flow of more than €1.8 billion, in addition to a new €1 billion share buyback program.\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (NASDAQ:CCEP) was part of 24 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 32 in the prior quarter. Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors was the leading stakeholder of the company, with 3.92 million shares valued at $301.3 million.\nOverall, CCEP ranks 10th among the 11 Top Performing European Stocks So Far In 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of European stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

For many investors, especially retirees, capital preservation has been top of mind. How can you keep your savings safe and still be invested in the stock market -- or is that even possible nowadays?\nOne blue chip stock you may be considering is Coca-Cola (KO -0.19%). The beverage company is known for its robust results and resiliency over the years. Can it be a good investment right now and be a way to help keep your portfolio safe?\nA huge advantage Coca-Cola has over other businesses is that it operates all over the world. That gives it flexibility. For example, President Donald Trump recently announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. But Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said that the company could adjust and use other packaging materials, such as plastic, to minimize the impact of those tariffs.\nThe company also has strong margins. Last year, Coca-Cola reported $10.6 billion in earnings on sales totaling $47.1 billion, which equates to a profit margin of nearly 23%. Even if there's an increase in costs, the company's strong profit margins put it in an excellent position to continue delivering solid earnings numbers. Coca-Cola, however, hasn't been a fast-growing business recently; from 2022 through 2024, its earnings grew by just 9%. \nThe last time the stock market was in a prolonged free fall was 2022. Growth stocks cratered amid concerns about rising inflation. Coca-Cola stock, however, proved to be a fairly safe investment at the time. Including its dividend, the stock's total returns were more than 10%, far better than the S&P 500's.\n\n^SPX data by YCharts\nHistorically, Coca-Cola has been a low-volatility stock to own, as it has averaged a beta of 0.45, indicating that it doesn't follow the market's swings. For investors seeking safety right now, that can make this an attractive investment. But it's important to remember that the past doesn't predict the future, and while Coca-Cola was able to pass on rising costs to consumers amid high inflation in recent years, it may not be as easy to do that now with many consumers feeling stretched.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 818% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 156% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nCoca-Cola stock can be a good place to park your money right now. If you just want to collect a good, safe dividend, this can be one of the better investments to consider putting in your portfolio today. Coca-Cola's business is rock solid and isn't going anywhere. It provides a dividend that yields 2.9% and can generate a lot of recurring income for you. \nThe only downside is that its growth prospects may not be all that strong, but this could still be an ideal stock to own if you're looking to keep your risk low and want some stable dividends. \n\n \n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 64% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\nAnd things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$15b in market cap last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 27%.\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Coca-Cola, beginning with the chart below.\n See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola \nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\nWe can see that Coca-Cola does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Coca-Cola's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Coca-Cola is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.3% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.4% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.1% of the company stock.\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Coca-Cola Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. \nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 26% stake in Coca-Cola. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nPublic companies currently own 9.3% of Coca-Cola stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Coca-Cola better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Coca-Cola (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

PEP. These two titans have been battling it out for more than a century, not just on supermarket shelves but across airwaves, billboards and now digital screens. While the rivalry was once defined by the cola commercials and the taste tests, the modern battlefield is far more complex — a competition spanning global market share, diversified portfolios, strategic agility and shareholder value.At first glance, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo may seem like mirror images: both are massive, globally recognized brands with deep roots in American culture and omnipresent product lines. But dig deeper, and you will find two fundamentally different companies. Coca-Cola is a beverage purist, focused solely on liquid refreshment, while PepsiCo has evolved into a diversified powerhouse, balancing beverages with an empire of snacks and packaged foods. Their strategic paths, investment philosophies and long-term visions diverge — and it is this divergence that makes the comparison so compelling for investors.This face-off is not just about which brand tastes better; it is about which business performs better. From market share and financial strength to innovation and sustainability, we will break down how each company stacks up in the real metrics — business strategy, revenue performance, portfolio depth, stock valuation and long-term potential.Whether you are a fan of fizz or a believer in balance, the data may surprise you. Let us step into the ring and see who really has the edge.\nCoca-Cola has long been the undisputed king of the global beverage industry — a brand so iconic that it is often the first name that comes to mind when people think of soft drinks. Commanding a 43% share of the global carbonated soft drink (CSD) market, Coca-Cola has maintained its dominance by staying laser-focused on one thing — beverages. This singular focus has allowed the company to build a powerhouse portfolio of more than 500 beverage brands, ranging from the legendary Coca-Cola Classic to innovations like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Smartwater, and its growing investments in coffee and energy drinks.What sets KO apart is its asset-light franchise model, in which it owns the brands and marketing muscle while outsourcing bottling and distribution to strategic partners. This model delivers high operating margins, scalability and a strong free cash flow — key ingredients for its long-standing reputation as a dividend aristocrat. The company currently yields a steady dividend of around 3%, backed by resilient cash flows even in volatile markets.Strategically, Coca-Cola has been pivoting from sugary sodas to healthier, functional and premium offerings. From acquiring Costa Coffee to expanding Fairlife’s high-protein dairy products, Coca-Cola is reimagining itself as a broader wellness beverage company. KO is also doubling down on emerging markets, where per-capita consumption is still relatively low but rapidly rising, creating a significant long-term growth opportunity.In a world of growing health consciousness, Coca-Cola is working hard to future-proof its brand by focusing on low and no-sugar alternatives, innovative packaging, and digital transformation through data analytics and AI-driven marketing. Its long-term goals are grounded in sustainability — achieving 100% recyclable packaging by 2030 and becoming water-neutral, which resonates with the next generation of socially conscious consumers.For investors, Coca-Cola offers a compelling blend of stability and slow-burning global growth. Its strong brand equity, disciplined capital strategy and exposure to high-growth regions make it a resilient pick for long-term portfolios, especially for those seeking reliable income and a defensive play in uncertain economic times.\nPEP may have started as KO’s feisty challenger in the cola wars, but it has evolved into something far more diversified and resilient. With a beverage market share of around 25%, PepsiCo might not match Coca-Cola’s dominance in CSDs.However, PEP outpaces KO in overall portfolio strength, thanks to its snacking and convenient food business, worth more than $40 billion, which includes iconic brands like Lay’s, Doritos, Quaker and Cheetos. In fact, more than half of PepsiCo’s revenues comes from snacks and foods, giving the company a two-pronged strategy that provides a buffer against beverage market volatility and allows it to ride consumer trends across categories.PepsiCo’s real strength lies in its balanced and adaptable business strategy. While Coca-Cola is doubling down on drinks, PEP is spreading its bets across consumer tastes and winning. It continues to invest heavily in healthier snacks, plant-based options and better-for-you products. At the same time, PEP is innovating in beverages through products like Bubly sparkling water and zero-sugar Gatorade, and leveraging its acquisition of SodaStream to expand into at-home consumption trends.Unlike Coca-Cola’s leaner operating model, PepsiCo is vertically integrated, with more direct control over manufacturing, distribution and retail execution. While this results in slightly lower margins, it gives the company superior agility and execution capabilities, especially in emerging markets, wherein localized supply chains are key to success. The company’s emphasis on digital transformation, AI-powered demand forecasting, and personalized marketing also puts it ahead of the curve in leveraging technology for growth.Looking forward, PepsiCo has bold ambitions; it plans to be net-zero by 2040. It is also heavily investing in regenerative agriculture and continues to expand its global snacking footprint, particularly in high-growth markets across Asia, Latin America and Africa. The company’s \"PepsiCo Positive\" sustainability initiative ties profitability to purpose — a strategic alignment that increasingly matters to institutional investors and ESG-focused funds.\nShares of PepsiCo show a declining trend in the year-to-date period due to the ongoing challenges related to subdued category demand in its convenient food business and the impacts of a product recall in the QFNA segment. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola shares have demonstrated steady growth in the past year, driven by resilient business trends. Year to date, PepsiCo shares have declined 6%, whereas Coca-Cola stock has rallied 15.5%.\n \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n \nFrom a valuation standpoint, PEP currently trades at a lower forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 17X compared with Coca-Cola’s 23.8X, making it more attractively priced, driven by its earnings and diversified revenue stream.\n \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n \nThe PEP stock looks cheap from a valuation perspective. Moreover, its diversity, pricing power and innovation engine make it a compelling long-term holding, especially for those seeking both growth and downside protection.Coca-Cola does seem pricey. However, its valuations reflect its strong brand equity, disciplined capital strategy and exposure to high-growth regions, making it a resilient pick for long-term portfolios.

PEP’s 2025 revenues are projected to decline 0.2% year over year to $91.7 billion, and EPS is expected to ascent 1.4% year over year to $8.27.\n \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n \nCoca-Cola’s EPS estimates for 2025 have been unchanged in the past 30 days, while the consensus estimates for 2026 moved down by a penny in the same period. KO’s 2025 revenues and EPS are expected to increase 2% and 2.8% year over year, respectively, to $48 billion and $2.96 per share.\n \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor investors seeking a blend of reliability and global reach, Coca-Cola offers a compelling case. As the undisputed leader in the beverage industry, the company’s streamlined, high-margin model and world-class brand portfolio offer a foundation for stability, resilience and predictable income.KO continues to evolve, introducing healthier, low-sugar alternatives and expanding its footprint in high-growth emerging markets, reinforcing its relevance in a shifting consumer landscape. However, its lofty valuation could be a hurdle for value-oriented investors seeking more compelling entry points or diversified growth exposure.Conversely, PepsiCo is the quintessential all-weather investment. Its diverse mix of beverages and snacks provides a natural hedge against category-specific headwinds, offering exposure to multiple growth levers. While the company is currently navigating shifts in consumer behavior, PepsiCo’s ability to innovate and localize its offerings across global markets positions it for sustained, long-term growth.PEP’s discounted valuation, balanced business exposure and broader growth potential give it a slight edge over Coca-Cola. With solid fundamentals and a discounted valuation, PepsiCo currently presents a more dynamic investment opportunity, particularly for those seeking a mix of defensive strength and forward-looking growth.Both KO and PEP currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), reflecting a neutral outlook — but beneath the surface, their strategic differences tell two distinct investment stories.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other best dividend monarchs.\nDividend-focused investors are generally well-acquainted with terms like Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Kings, but many may not be aware of a lesser-known group called Dividend Monarchs. While they fall under the broader category of dividend growth stocks, they carry a distinct title. The Dividend Monarchs Index highlights US companies that have managed to raise their dividends consistently for at least 50 consecutive years. These firms have weathered decades of market ups and downs, showcasing both resilience and steady performance in terms of dividend growth and stock returns. As an evolution of the well-known S&P Dividend Aristocrats Index Series, the S&P Dividend Monarchs Index sets an even higher standard, recognizing a more exclusive tier of long-term dividend payers.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices has been a pioneer in dividend growth strategies since the 1980s, initially tracking US companies with at least 10 years of dividend increases. As the number of such companies grew, the threshold was raised to 25 years, forming the basis for the Dividend Aristocrats Index, launched in 2005. This index became a widely recognized benchmark, eventually expanding to include mid- and small-cap stocks as well as global markets. By April 2023, over $40 billion in ETF assets tracked these indices. With a rising number of companies now surpassing 50 consecutive years of dividend growth across different market caps, S&P introduced the Dividend Monarchs Index in 2023 to reflect this new elite group.\nThe key distinction between Dividend Kings and Dividend Monarchs lies in the inclusion criteria. While both require at least 50 consecutive years of dividend increases, Dividend Monarchs must also meet specific standards set by S&P. To qualify for the Dividend Monarchs Index, a company must be part of the Composite 1500, have a float-adjusted market capitalization of at least $2 billion, maintain a three-month average daily trading value of $5 million or more, and consistently grow its dividend over five decades. This added layer of eligibility makes Monarchs a more selective, index-based group.\nCompanies that meet the tough 50-year dividend growth requirement tend to show strong profitability and financial stability. According to an S&P Dow Jones Indices report dated April 30, 2023, the Dividend Monarchs Index outperformed both the broader market and the S&P Composite in terms of return on equity (ROE) and showed more consistent earnings. The report also noted that, based on back-tested data since January 31, 2018, the Dividend Monarchs Index displayed more defensive traits—offering lower volatility and smaller drawdowns than the S&P 500 during market declines.\nAlthough the Dividend Monarchs Index is a relatively new concept with only five years of back-tested performance, it has grown significantly during that time, expanding from 11 to 35 constituents. Despite the index’s short history, the companies included have a track record of at least 50 consecutive years of dividend growth, dating as far back as 1972. According to data presented by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the performance of these companies—measured through both price returns over the past 50 years and total returns since December 1989—has generally outpaced that of the broader market. This suggests that many of the index’s constituents have delivered stronger long-term results. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best Dividend Monarchs to invest in.\nA row of factory workers assembling bottles of sparkling soft drinks on a conveyor belt.\nFor this list, we scanned the holdings of the S&P Dividend Monarchs Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 50 consecutive years of dividend growth. From that list, we picked 10 stocks that were most popular among hedge funds, as per Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the hedge funds having stakes in them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\nWarren Buffett’s favorite, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a multinational beverage company that offers a wide range of products. The company has traditionally held up well during economic downturns. A large share of its yearly revenue comes from selling concentrate syrup for its signature beverages—a business model that requires relatively little capital investment yet delivers strong profitability. Over the past five years, the company has consistently maintained profit margins above 20%, underscoring the strength and efficiency of its operations.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) reported revenue of $11.5 billion, marking a 6.5% increase compared to the same period last year. Organic revenue rose by 14%, driven by a 9% boost in pricing and mix, along with a 5% uptick in concentrate sales. The company gained ground across its beverage categories, with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar showing notable growth—unit volume jumped 13% during the quarter. Its continued success was also supported by creative marketing efforts, which have added roughly $40 billion in retail sales to the flagship brand over the past three years.\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) maintained solid cash generation, producing $2.9 billion in operating cash flow and $1.6 billion in free cash flow. The quarter also saw an adjusted operating margin of 30.7%, highlighting the company’s strong profitability. It announced a 5.2% hike in its quarterly dividend in February to $0.51 per share, which was the company’s 63rd consecutive year of dividend growth. The stock supports a dividend yield of 2.84%, as of April 15.\nOverall, KO ranks 3rd on our list of the best Dividend Monarchs to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of KO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than KO but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\nDisclosure: None.

Here's a look at why dividend investors like Realty Income and why there's another net lease REIT that may be a better choice today.  What does Realty Income do?\nMany growth-focused companies don't pay dividends at all, which is why the yield on the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has fallen to just 1.4%.  Stocks with reliable dividends and high yields can be excellent ways to collect passive income no matter what the broader market is doing.  Here's why these three fool.com contributors think Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE: BEP) (NYSE: BEPC), and MSC Industrial Direct (NYSE: MSM) are three high-yield dividend stocks to buy now.\nThe stock market has slumped sharply this year due to concerns that tariffs could cause a recession.  One positive from the sell-off is that lower stock prices cause dividend yields to rise.  Because of that, investors can lock in dividend yields of 5% or more on some high-quality companies right now.\nToronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD) has a 5% dividend yield.  Realty Income's (NYSE: O) yield is 5.7%.  There was a large fine, the company is upgrading its internal controls, and TD Bank, as it is more commonly known, is operating under an asset cap in the U.S. The asset cap is the big problem because it basically means TD Bank can't expand its U.S. business until regulators are convinced the money laundering issue is in the past.\nWith President Donald Trump announcing a wide set of tariffs, there could be increased costs for a range of companies.
