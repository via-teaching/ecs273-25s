Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported Q2 strong results, underscoring its resilience. Its product gross-margin decline of 0.7 percentage point to below 36% in its March quarter, while iPhone gross margins slipped 1 ppt to 38.3%; revenue forecasts were largely unchanged, but shares tumbled about 4% Friday after analysts pinpointed a roughly $900 million tariff hit in the June quarter.
J.P. Morgan's Samik Chatterjee retained an Overweight rating with a $240 price target (down from $245) but warned that tariffs, now tracking above estimates, will bite into margins and trim earnings, noting that limited F3Q guidance had outperformed Street fears before tariff commentary drove the sell-off.
Jefferies cut its rating to Underperform, arguing each 1 ppt tariff uptick could shave 1.5 ppt off FY25 pre-tax profits, with its DCF-based valuation implying 20% downside.
On the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook detailed that India now supplies about half of U.S.-destined iPhones and Vietnam handles production of most iPads, Macs, Watches and AirPods, a strategy Morgan Stanley's Erik Woodring says capped the June tariff bill near $900 million and underscores that Southeast Asia diversification is working; however, management offered no segment-level guidance for the June quarter, leaving analysts cautious.
Bank of America's Wamsi Mohan maintained a Buy rating but cut his target to $235 from $240 on cautious margin forecasts, while Wedbush's Daniel Ives reiterated Outperform and raised his target to $270, praising Cupertino's grip on trade risks, and niche contrarians argue today's sell-off is a contrarian entry point given the broader macro resilience.
Analysts also highlighted Apple's Services segmenthistorically accounting for over 20% of revenueand steady Wearables, Home and Accessories growth as crucial buffers against hardware margin pressures.
Edison Lee of Jefferies noted that resilient subscription and software sales help cushion earnings, and Tech Contrarians' Investing Group urged long-term investors to see the tariff-driven pullback as a buying opportunity, arguing that American supplier content outweighs any Chinese manufacturer gains.
Investors should note that although tariff headwinds may squeeze near-term gross margins and earnings, Apple's diversified revenue streamsfrom robust Services contributions to high-margin Wearablesand effective supply-chain reshoring underpin its ability to sustain cash flow and fund shareholder returns.
Markets will now focus on Apple's July Q3 guidance and any mid-June developments in U.S. trade policy for fresh directional cues.
