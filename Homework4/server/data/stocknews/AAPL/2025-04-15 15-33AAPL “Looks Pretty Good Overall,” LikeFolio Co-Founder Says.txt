"Apple (AAPL) continues to dominate" when it comes to serving and exciting customers, Andy Swan, the co-founder of LikeFolio told Schwab Network recently.
Swan predicted that the tech giant would launch "an incredible consumer product within the next couple of years," adding that "we're very bullish on Apple over the long term."

Signs of Strength for Apple
In the area of year-over-year increases in internet searches by consumers, "the iPhone is surging, and the iPad, MacBook, and Air Pods are all doing very well," Swan reported.
Meanwhile, MacBook is benefiting from the Vibe coding trend that was triggered by the proliferation of AI, and AAPL "is doing a great job of continuing to hold and advance its market share versus Android in most places," Swan reported.
Also importantly, Apple "is doing a phenomenal job of integrating AI technology in a smart, sustainable way," he stated.
The Recent Price Action of AAPL Stock
In the last month, the stock has dropped 5%, while it's down 13% in the last three months. Over the last 12 months, however, the shares are up 20%.
While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.
