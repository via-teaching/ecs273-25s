Many of those plans, however, were already in the works or don't necessarily go <a class="link" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" data-rapid_p="26" data-ylk="slk:above prior spending levels;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apples-500-billion-is-mostly-already-in-the-books-7cc7123e" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">above prior spending levels</a>. Nvidia, for example, talked up <a class="link" data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" data-rapid_p="27" data-ylk="slk:building chips in the US last year;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/foxconn-blackwell-omniverse/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">building chips in the US last year</a>.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">And while that doesn't take away from the fact that the companies are pouring money into the US, it doesn't exactly support the idea that they're moving vast amounts of their manufacturing capabilities to America.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">"We believe hardware companies will remain focused on accelerating US-bound product assembly out of China, and see India and Mexico as the most-likely incremental beneficiaries of these actions (we'd argue Vietnam and Mexico have been the biggest beneficiaries over the last 5 years)," Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in an investor note.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">"We just don't see large volume hardware production ever reaching US shores — these plans take years to devise, the costs (capex and opex) associated with manufacturing hundreds of millions of products annually in the US are high, and most importantly, tariff exemptions on finished goods disincentivize on-shoring (and is why we didn't see onshoring after President Trump's first administration)," he added</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Even if companies brought their manufacturing bases to the US, they'd still have to deal with a host of headwinds ranging from worker salaries to the need to continue importing certain parts from abroad.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">According to Bank of America's Wamsi Mohan, while Apple may be able to find enough laborers in the US to build its iPhones, importing the company's entire supply chain will still take some time.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">"This is because, while it may be possible to move final assembly to the US, moving the entire iPhone supply chain would be a much bigger undertaking and would likely take many years, if even possible."</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">It's not just Apple that's contending with these issues. Everything from laptop makers to display producers would face the same problems if they were to move to the US. That doesn't even take into account the potential price increases associated with manufacturing tech products in the US.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">According to some estimates, prices on devices could jump by hundreds of dollars, resulting in demand destruction as consumers seek out less expensive options or hold onto their existing smartphones and computers for longer periods.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">While it's unlikely manufacturing is coming back to the US, there's still plenty of uncertainty about how tech companies and consumers navigate the next four years of tariff shocks.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><em>Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, which is now based in Singapore, said in separate but nearly identical notices that their operating expenses have gone up “due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs.”  Both companies said they would be making “price adjustments” starting April 25, although neither provided details about the size of the increases.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">The news comes a day after Nvidia warned of a $5.5 billion hit as Washington restricted exports of its AI processor tailored for China.
