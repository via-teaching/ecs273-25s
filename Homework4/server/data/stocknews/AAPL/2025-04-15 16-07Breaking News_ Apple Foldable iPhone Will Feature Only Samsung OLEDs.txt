April 15- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has reportedly chosenSamsung Displayas the exclusive supplier of OLED screens for its first foldable iPhone, expected to debut in the second half of 2025.
The move sidelines competitors such as LG Display and China's BOE, highlighting Samsung Electronics' (SSNLF) dominance in foldable OLED tech. Samsung's ability to minimize screen creasesa key flaw in current foldableswas said to be a major factor in the decision, the report said.
Mass production is expected to begin later this year or in early 2025. The foldable device is rumored to feature a 7.8-inch internal OLED screen, similar in size to the iPad Mini, and a 5.5-inch external display. The price could land near $2,000, putting it in direct competition with Samsung's own Galaxy Z Fold.
The production volume is still under discussion, but industry insiders suggest Apple may exceed its initial target of 9 million units, potentially reaching over 15 million.
The deal could help Samsung make up for its loss of foldable OLED market share last year that dropped to around 40% and reach 70% in 2025 as demand for the technology soars and competition dwindles, analysts say.
