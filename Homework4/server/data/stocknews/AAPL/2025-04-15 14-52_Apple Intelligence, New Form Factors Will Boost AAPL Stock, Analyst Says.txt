Apple (AAPL) will effectively develop Apple Intelligence, while "new form factors" will boost the tech giant's 2026 revenue, Angelo Zino, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research predicted recently on the Schwab Network. Zino has a $235 price target and a Buy rating on the shares. A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Apple's Positive Catalysts The development of Apple Intelligence, which will become "more accessible" in China, will enable the demand for the iPhone 17 to be strong,  Zino asserted. Further, "new form factors" that will be launched by the firm, such as foldables, will boost its revenue in 2026, according to the analyst. Turning to Services, Zino predicts that the business will continue to grow at an annual rate of about 9%, providing another positive catalyst for AAPL stock. Apple "Can Work With" the Tariffs, Zino Says Apple is likely to end up with "a blended tariff" of 10%-30% on its products, based on the combination of hardware that it will import from China and India, Zino estimated. At those levels, the company can increase its prices "moderately," preventing both "meaningful demand destruction" and significant gross margin declines, the analyst predicted.
