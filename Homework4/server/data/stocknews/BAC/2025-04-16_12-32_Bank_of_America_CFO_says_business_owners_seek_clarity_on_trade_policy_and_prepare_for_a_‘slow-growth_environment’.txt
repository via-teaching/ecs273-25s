BofA’s commercial clients range from small businesses to middle-market and large corporations.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">They’re seeking clarity, not just around trade policy, but also the tax package and regulatory reform. “Every day provides a little more information” and also “a little bit more in the way of certainty for people,” he said.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">He added: “It's a slow-growth environment. That's what we continue to try and support our clients through.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">CFOs certainly are grappling with <a class="link" data-rapid_p="12" data-ylk="slk:tariff uncertainty;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://fortune.com/2025/04/14/leading-tariffs-advice-levis-veteran-cfo/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tariff uncertainty</a>. Some are <a class="link" data-rapid_p="13" data-ylk="slk:taking actions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://fortune.com/2025/03/17/companies-facing-tariff-turmoil-should-embrace-strategic-optionality-cfo/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">taking actions</a> such as devising alternative-sourcing plans, stockpiling greater inventory, and creating financial buffers.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">However, BofA's research team at this point doesn't believe we'll see a recession, Borthwick said. And clients continue to show "encouraging signs." Employment remains healthy, and consumers have proven resilient, he said.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">For its Q1, Bank of America reported on Tuesday net income of $7.4 billion and earnings per share of 90 cents, up from 76 cents the same time last year. Revenue growth was 6%. It was driven by net interest income (NII), which was up 3% from the prior year, reaching $14.6 billion, partially helped by lower deposit costs. NII is the difference between what the bank earns on loans and investments and pays out on its liabilities, including deposits.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">BofA maintained its guidance that NII will reach $15.5 to $15.7 billion in the fourth quarter and achieve 6% to 7% year-over-year growth for 2025, Borthwick said. This goes against the grain of what’s becoming more common this earnings season—some companies are <a class="link" data-rapid_p="14" data-ylk="slk:pulling guidance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://fortune.com/2025/04/11/ceo-earnings-guidance-delta-carmax-profits-outlook/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">pulling guidance</a> due to tariff tumult.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">“We run our business to withstand volatility over the short and the long term and through our responsible growth strategy,” Borthwick said on the media call. BofA is prepared to manage through any potential downturn in the economy, he said.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">An analyst asked during BofA’s Q1 earnings call on Tuesday if there will be any potential impacts from the U.S. stock market <a class="link" data-rapid_p="15" data-ylk="slk:losing trillions in wealth;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://fortune.com/2025/04/13/trump-tariff-stock-market-losses-dow-sp500-nasdaq-breakeven-rally/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">losing trillions in wealth</a> following the announcement of the Trump administration's sweeping <a class="link" data-rapid_p="16" data-ylk="slk:tariff policy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://fortune.com/2025/04/02/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-liberation-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tariff policy</a>.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The real risk in any bank's balance sheet is going to be its credit posture, CEO Brian Moynihan said on the call. Even if there is “a very slight recession…we should fare well in that,” he said.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">No one has a crystal ball to perfectly predict the future, Moynihan said. BofA is positioning itself for every outcome, he said. “But we don't want people to lose sight of the strong performance of this company and our team in the first quarter of 2025,” Moynihan said.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><strong>Sheryl</strong> <strong>Estrada</strong><br/><a class="link" data-rapid_p="18" data-ylk="slk:sheryl.estrada@fortune.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="mailto:sheryl.estrada@fortune.com">sheryl.estrada@fortune.com</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">This story was originally featured on <a class="link" data-rapid_p="19" data-ylk="slk:Fortune.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://fortune.com/2025/04/16/bank-of-america-cfo-business-owners-trade-policy-slow-growth-tariffs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Fortune.com</a></p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">The purchases are a sign of confidence despite growing concern about an economic slowdown this year.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">As chair of the House Financial Services Committee, French Hill is helping shepherd key crypto legislation.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">Patreon is finally experimenting with native livestreaming, a new feature that could attract more creators and help them earn more money.
