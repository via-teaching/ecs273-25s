Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) posted what appeared to be a strong Q1 2025, with11% year-over-year growthin net income and 18% growth in EPS to $0.90. Management boasted through 12 consecutive quarters of growth in trading revenues and highlighted a resilient consumer segment. But under the positive story, a complicated story is revealed. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with BAC. A deep analysis of the finances, specifically around cash flow, margin quality, and business segment variance, hints at structural weakness hiding under the surface-level growth. Source:Q1 Deck Initially, BAC produced a clean beat. Revenue rose 6% YoY to $27.4B, with a minor 3% increase in both Net Interest Income (NII) and 10% growth in noninterest income. On closer examination, however, one sees that earnings quality is diminishing. Free cash flow metrics, still hidden from headline coverage, provide a more conservative story. While the EPS did increase by $0.14 YoY, free cash flow is not increasing proportionally, under the strain of a 6% sequential increase in noninterest expenses as well as flattening net charge-off volumes. Operating income grew only 12% while the credit loss provisioning rose 12% YoY to $1.48B. The net charge-offs continued to be high at $1.45B, flat YoY as well as QoQ, despite the rhetoric from management of "responsible growth" as well as "strong credit quality." Consumer charge-offs rose as credit card delinquencies have risen, with loss rate increasing from 3.79% to 4.05% quarter-on-quarter. That deterioration is contrary to the CEO remark that "consumers have shown resilience." In addition, the quarter-end reserve build of $28M reversed a release from the previous quarter, quietly reflecting increasing credit stress under the surface. This reserve pattern, combined with worsening deposit cost dynamics (i.e., increasing cost of deposits within GWIM and Global Banking up to 2.50% and 2.89%, respectively), indicates forward-looking margin compression risks regardless of healthy short-term EPS. Source: Q1 Deck BAC's story of diversified resilience falls apart upon analyzing segment-level trends. For example, Global Markets revenue jumped 12% YoY (the best level in a decade), while its efficiency ratio declined from 59% a year ago to 58%. This means gains were accompanied by higher costs rather than higher productivity. Growth of trading and sales, especially record Equities revenue of +17% YoY, overwhelmed the flatness of investment banking (down 3% YoY) as well as business lending (down 13% YoY). In Consumer Banking, revenues ascended 3% YoY to $10.5B, though its net income actually declined by 5% to $2.53B. The decline was fueled by a 6% rise in costs as well as a 12% rise of credit loss provisions. The risk-adjusted margin of the segment declined to 6.68%, lowest they have seen since 2022, even as the company is celebrating 250,000 new checking accounts. Global Wealth and Investment Management (GWIM) reported an 8% growth in revenues and a 15% gain in AUM fee revenues, thanks to market appreciation. Yet, net income remained steady YoY, as costs kept up with revenues by growing +9% YoY. Although AUM flows remained healthy ($24B for Q1), costs of deposits went up to 2.50%, while deposits declined by 4% YoY, reflecting customers moving out of cash for higher yields elsewhere. Global Banking, traditionally a volume anchor, reported flat revenues along with a 3% fall in investment banking fees YoY. While treasury service charges rose by 14% and deposits grew well (+9% YoY), they were offset by weaker NII and subdued business lending. Source: Q1 Deck At face value, BAC's strategy is still all about "Responsible Growth," digital growth, as well as fee income volume scaling. But some of the recent trends do cast doubt as to whether the bank is on the attack or defense. An example: Consumer Banking registered a 17% YoY gain in digital logons and now accounts for 65% of its sales through digital venues. Impressive, perhaps, but accompanied by slowing foot traffic (financial centers dropped to 3,681 from 3,804) as well as credit card balances leveling off ($100.2B vs. $100.9B in Q4). Correspondingly, the bank boasted of adding 7,200 new GWIM client relationships, though overall client balances sequentially fell from $4.25T to $4.16T, and deposits lost $11B YoY. The digital push is actually a channel-optimization tactic instead of actual economic activity expansion. Even Zelle payment volumes, up 23% YoY, are not likely to positively impact the bottom line. One of the indicators of defensiveness is reserve behavior by BAC. In the face of steady charge-offs, the choice of building reserves instead of releasing them indicates forward-looking worries, perhaps relating to consumer credit fundamentals or commercial real estate. The commentary by the company's management recognized "a potentially changing economy," backpedaling from its otherwise optimistic tone. Source:federalreserve.gov At ~$37 a share, BAC is trading around10.2x forward earningsand 1.37x tangible book value. On the surface, that looks reasonable by historical standards, but further scrutiny calls into question whether current multiples are reflective of underlying risks. Free cash flow yield, normalized for reserve builds and higher costs, compresses to ~7%, reflecting low margin of safety. Peer group comparisons uncover the discrepancy. JPMorgan is trading at a modest premium (~1.5 times TBV) with higher return on tangible common equity (ROTCE of 19% compared with 13.9% for BAC) and higher quality fee franchise. BAC's ROTCE was lifted by share buybacks ($4.5B) during the quarter, hiding the fact that pretax pre-provision income rose by only 12% YoY, a lower growth compared with the growth of its EPS on the back of tax and capital efficiency. One other red flag is NII guidance. Q4 2025 NII is guided by management for $15.5B$15.7B, reflecting only 7.5% sequential growth over the subsequent three quarters. With only 3% YoY growth Q1 NII and asset sensitivity reducing (a 100bps parallel shift down detracts from NII by $2.2B), the upside seems restricted, particularly within a lower-rate scenario. Warren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio) and the departed Charlie Munger both have stood behind Bank of America in earnest, with Buffett through Berkshire Hathaways multi-billion-dollar investment and Munger through theDaily Journal Corp(Trades,Portfolio)orations historically concentrated stake. Their support confirms the long-term strength of the franchise, specifically its scale of deposits and built-in earnings power. However, even as the banks underlying value remains secure, a deep examination of its most recent earnings leaves the impression that the medium-term might not be as straightforward. Increasing charge-offs, pressure on efficiency, and tepid loan growth are signs that the next-term performance might differ from the ease of compounding the headline results might suggest. For institutional investors taking a cue from Buffett and Munger, the question isnt anymore whether Bank of America is a solid bank, or whether todays price tracks sufficient skepticism about the future. In short, Bank of America Q1 2025 earnings are strong on the face of it, but under forensic examination, there are material disconnections between cash flow integrity, segment profitability, and strategic positioning. Investors need to look past headline EPS and analyze underlying credit trends, funding cost structures, and NII guidance credibility to formulate a balanced risk-reward assessment.
