United Airlines doesn’t expect tariffs to have a significant impact on what it pays for planes, Chief Executive Scott Kirby said. Most of the aircraft deliveries United is waiting on will come from Boeing, and most of its new Airbus planes are being built in Alabama, though the network of suppliers that the plane makers rely on is spread throughout the world. Rival Delta Air Lines said last week it won’t pay tariffs on any new Airbus planes coming its way and would defer any deliveries affected by new levies.
