</p>, <p class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html" id="mntl-sc-block_4-0"> The bank said it now expects U.S. hotels' average revenue per available room, or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revpar.asp">RevPAR</a>, to grow 0.4% in 2025, down from its prior estimate of 1.4%.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger wrapped" data-id="#citation-1" tabindex="0"><span>1</span></span> As a result, Goldman analysts dropped their rating for Hyatt Hotels (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=H">H</a>) stock to “sell," and downgraded Marriott International (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=MAR">MAR</a>) and Hilton Worldwide (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=HLT">HLT</a>) to “neutral.” 
</p>, <p class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html" id="mntl-sc-block_6-0"> The updated forecast does not account for a recession, Goldman said, which “would likely drive further downside." The bank currently places the odds of a recession at 45%, noting that past economic downturns have brought double-digit declines in RevPAR.
</p>, <p class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html" id="mntl-sc-block_8-0"> Shares of Hyatt dropped 3% Monday, while Marriott and Hilton fell about 1%, amid broader market gains.

</p>, <p class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html" id="mntl-sc-block_11-0"> In March, three of the largest U.S. airlines—Delta Air Lines (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=DAL">DAL</a>), Southwest Airlines (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=LUV">LUV</a>), and American Airlines (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AAL">AAL</a>)—had <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/americans-aren-t-traveling-as-much-as-airlines-expected-this-year-11694535">dropped projections</a> for the first quarter of the year, citing weakening travel demand amid worries about the economy.
</p>, <p class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html" id="mntl-sc-block_13-0"> Delta CEO Ed Bastian said last week that people are “acting as if we're going <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/americans-are-behaving-as-if-theyre-going-into-a-recession-delta-ceo-says-11711319">[into] a recession</a>,” and the airline withdrew its full-year guidance.
