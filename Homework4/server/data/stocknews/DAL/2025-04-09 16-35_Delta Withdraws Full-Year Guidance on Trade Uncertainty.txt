A dealmaking freeze and the biggest stocks rout since 2023 are raising the stakes for Wall Street’s earnings season Delta Air Lines Inc. withdrew its full-year financial guidance due to uncertainty surrounding global trade as it reported first-quarter results. While Delta still anticipates a profit in 2025, it declined to reaffirm the forecast issued in January. Dani Burger reports on Bloomberg Television. Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) kicked off earnings season with a whimper, but the airline's relatively benign outlook was far better than some investors had anticipated.  The results provided a lift to the entire sector, with carriers including Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) up as much as 5.3% at the open.  The stocks gave back some of those gains as the morning continued, but Southwest was still up 2% as of 11 a.m. ET.
