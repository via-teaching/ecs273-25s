We recently published a list of How Did Jim Cramer’s 12 Bold Predictions Play Out?. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently discussed.
During the most recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer revisited the recent turbulence in artificial intelligence stocks, three months after the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI firm that initially rattled markets. He noted that despite the broad pullback in the sector, many of the fears triggered by DeepSeek’s debut have not materialized, which has led to a reconsideration of the panic that followed.
“Three months ago, January 23rd is a day that will live in artificial intelligence infamy. That’s when we learned that a Chinese firm called DeepSeek had figured out a way to train high quality generative AI models using far less hardware. They claim their hardware costs were around $6 million versus $80 to $100 million for their enormous American competitors.”

The announcement sent shockwaves through the market. Cramer recalled how NVIDIA saw its stock fall sharply over just two trading sessions. The market reaction spread quickly beyond and hit other companies tied to data center infrastructure, which eventually pulled down the broader Nasdaq. However, Cramer noted that the company then revealed plans to build $500 billion worth of AI infrastructure in the United States over the next four years.
Cramer noted that initially, it seemed to signal a renewed sense of stability. But soon after, the administration imposed a ban on selling AI chips to China, which forced the GPU kingpin to write down $5.5 billion tied to that entire initiative. Even so, Cramer emphasized that the company’s core business remained strong.
“We understand that they’re basically sold out for the year, even as they can only sell their best stuff in the United States and the 18 friendly countries.”
Cramer attributed the export restrictions to a policy from former President Biden, one that President Trump has not reversed. Despite the geopolitical constraints, Cramer stressed that demand for the company’s technology is still overwhelming. He argued that the stock never should have experienced such a steep drop in the first place. He added:
“Even with the trade war, the AI infrastructure theme seems totally back on track. In fact, it never left the track to begin with.”

During the lightning round, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL), one of the major U.S. airlines, was brought up by a viewer seeking Cramer’s opinion at the time. Cramer gave a straightforward reply:
“I like Delta very much. I actually have to prefer [inaudible]. I like it. I like United too. I think they’re both good. Now remember they’re very inexpensive stocks but they trade wildly. But I do like Delta.”
The airline stock is down 16.59% since that episode aired.
Cramer discussed airline stocks and the negative sentiment around them earlier in April. Here’s what he said about Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL):
“I know that people don’t like the stock but if you want an airline, the one that people are buying, it’s Delta. It’s all the way down to 40. It sells at seven times earnings. People feel that the travel bull market is over. I regard these as what I call trading vehicles. But if you want to trade one; the one you want to trade is Delta, DAL.”
Overall, DAL ranks 6th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of DAL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DAL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's ASE Technology Holding Co. has yet to decide how it will support a plan by Nvidia to build artificial intelligence servers worth as much as $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, it said on Wednesday.  The company, the world's largest chip packaging and testing provider, is still evaluating an invitation from a customer to invest in the U.S. and has yet to decide on the investment size or timing, its Chief Financial Officer Joseph Tung told an earnings call.  He did not name the customer but the company later confirmed to Reuters that he was talking about a plan announced by AI chip giant Nvidia made public earlier this month to expand production in the U.S., with the help of partners including ASE subsidiary Siliconware Precision Industries.
