A dealmaking freeze and the biggest stocks rout since 2023 are raising the stakes for Wall Street’s earnings season Delta Air Lines reported significant growth in revenue and net income during its recent earnings announcement, yet its share price saw a decline of 15% over the last week. This movement occurred against the backdrop of a turbulent market rocked by escalating trade tariffs, with the broader market indices experiencing a 12% drop.
