Umpleby will be replaced as CEO by Chief Operating Officer (COO) Joe Creed, a 28-year Caterpillar veteran. Creed also will be joining the board on May 1.

Shares of Caterpillar, a Dow component, were little changed before the opening bell, edging just a bit higher. Wall Street analysts have a mean price target of around $364 on the shares, representing a more-than-20% premium to yesterday's close.
