He was named COO in October 2023, widely seen as a precursor to his elevation to CEO.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Analysts highlighted Creed’s leadership in Energy &amp; Transportation as key to Caterpillar’s evolving strategy. <br/><br/>Barclays noted investor focus on the segment has grown alongside demand for data centers and power generation, where Caterpillar sees potential for competitive differentiation.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Umpleby’s tenure is credited with restoring stability and profitability through a renewed focus on core businesses. <br/><br/>Barclays said his leadership saw Caterpillar streamline its operations, prioritize R&amp;D, and make selective, strategic acquisitions like the $400 million deal for Weir’s Oil &amp; Gas unit.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Related articles</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-rapid_p="12" data-ylk="slk:Wall Street sees strategic continuity as Caterpillar names Creed CEO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wall-street-sees-strategic-continuity-as-caterpillar-names-creed-ceo-3986229?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_campaign=yahoo-www" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wall Street sees strategic continuity as Caterpillar names Creed CEO</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-rapid_p="13" data-ylk="slk:BofA downgrades U.S. chemical sector amid slowdown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bofa-downgrades-us-chemical-sector-amid-slowdown-3986411?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_campaign=yahoo-www" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BofA downgrades U.S. chemical sector amid slowdown</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-rapid_p="14" data-ylk="slk:Bernstein starts Xiaomi at ‘outperform,’ sees EV push as key equity driver;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bernstein-starts-xiaomi-at-outperform-sees-ev-push-as-key-equity-driver-3986340?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_campaign=yahoo-www" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bernstein starts Xiaomi at ‘outperform,’ sees EV push as key equity driver</a></p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">Halliburton (HAL) doesn't possess the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely earnings beat in its upcoming report.
