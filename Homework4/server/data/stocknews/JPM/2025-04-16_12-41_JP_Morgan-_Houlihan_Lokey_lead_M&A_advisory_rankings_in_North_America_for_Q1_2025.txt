During Q1 2025, it advised on 25 billion-dollar deals that also included four mega deals valued more than or equal to $10bn.”</p>, <p>The analysis further indicates that Goldman Sachs ranked second in terms of value, advising on $110.9bn worth of deals, followed by Morgan Stanley with $89bn, Citi with $76.5bn, and Barclays with $66.7bn.</p>, <p>In terms of deal volume, JP Morgan held the second position with 43 transactions, followed by Goldman Sachs with 36 deals, Morgan Stanley with 31 deals, and Piper Sandler with 25 deals.</p>, <p><em>GlobalData’s league tables are based on the real-time tracking of thousands of company websites, advisory firm websites and other reliable sources available on the secondary domain.
