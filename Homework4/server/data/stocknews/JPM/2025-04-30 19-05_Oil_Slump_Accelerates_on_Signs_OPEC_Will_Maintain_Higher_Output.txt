West Texas Intermediate fell as much as 4.2% on Wednesday after Reuters reported that Saudi Arabian officials have been telling allies and industry experts that the kingdom can endure a sustained period of depressed prices. The most-active contract capped its biggest monthly decline since November 2021.
The report added to existing concerns that Saudi Arabia planned to steer OPEC+ to agree on another supply surge next week.
“This confirms the market’s fears that Saudi Arabia’s accelerated unwinds were not temporary, but a long-term strategy shift,” said Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Group. It raises the question of whether “Saudi is going to repeat the 2020 playbook to dramatically increase production.”
OPEC+ rocked the crude market in early April, with a surprise decision to increase supply in May by 411,000 barrels a day, the equivalent of three monthly tranches from a previous plan. Morgan Stanley has said it expects a “meaningful surplus” to develop over time, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. warned the cartel may accelerate planned production increases at a meeting next week.
Beyond OPEC+, non-cartel nations are also expected to add supplies, including drillers in Canada and Guyana, feeding concerns about a global glut.
At the same time, hopes are fading that there will be quick breakthroughs in US-led trade negotiations, weighing on the outlook for energy demand. The US economy contracted for the first time since 2022 in the first quarter as a result of a surge in pre-tariff imports and softer consumer spending. In China, factory activity slipped into the worst contraction since December 2023, revealing early damage from the trade war.
Trump said in remarks to ABC News that China deserved the steep tariffs he’d imposed on their exports. Hee said later Wednesday that he didn’t want China’s products unless the country is fair.

UBS on Wednesday posted better than expected first-quarter net profit, but the Swiss bank warned of an uncertain outlook as U.S. tariffs raise global growth fears even as the market tumult drove up earnings in its trading activity.  Switzerland's biggest bank reported net profit attributable to shareholders of $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025, down from $1.8 billion a year earlier, but beating an average estimate of $1.3 billion in a company-provided poll of analysts.  In its investment banking division, global markets enjoyed a record quarter with revenues up 32% year-on-year, underpinned by higher client activity in equities and foreign exchange, UBS said.
The Commerce Department reported that GDP declined in 1Q, but the fall was attributed mainly to greater imports as underlying demand stayed strong.  Top of mind for yields traders, the Treasury said it won’t adjust debt-auction sizes for the foreseeable future.  Trading is calm today, however, after this morning’s two major updates at 8:30 a.m. ET—the advance estimate of 1Q GDP, which fell at an annualized 0.3% pace, and the Treasury Department’s quarterly refunding statement.

Former Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren says a US recession is likely this summer unless the Trump administration pulls back on its tariff policy. He expects the Federal Reserve to move slowly until it's apparent "what the inflation and employment shocks are." He speaks on "Bloomberg Surveillance."
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Treasury's primary dealers say they would prefer to end the federal debt ceiling, as it likely increases debt service costs and market volatility and may hurt the dollar's reserve asset status, minutes of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) showed on Wednesday.  "The Committee expressed that its preferred option would be for Congress to delegate broad authority to the administration to borrow as necessary to fund government obligations," the TBAC said in the minutes from its quarterly refunding meeting held on Tuesday.  Treasury debt yields surged this month after Trump announced punishing "reciprocal" tariffs on many countries on April 2.
Countries across the Middle East and North Africa face significant challenges to economic growth as the region faces economic uncertainty due to tariff measures, lower-than-recent oil prices and cuts to financial aid, the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday.  The IMF's regional outlook report for the MENA region said Brent crude oil prices — which are down from highs above $120 a barrel in 2022 — are likely to be $65 to $69 per barrel in 2025 and 2026, making energy-exporting economies vulnerable to market fluctuations.  Tariff plans by the U.S. and other countries and geopolitical tensions also have created mounting economic uncertainty globally that is weighing down on the region's economies, which could negatively impact their growth by anywhere from 2% to 4.5%, said Jihad Azour, director for Middle East and Central Asia at the IMF.
