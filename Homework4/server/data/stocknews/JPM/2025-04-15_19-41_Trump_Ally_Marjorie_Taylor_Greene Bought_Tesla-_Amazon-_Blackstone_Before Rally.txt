On the morning of the 9th, Trump posted on social media that it was a “great time to buy.” About four hours later, he announced he was suspending tariffs, propelling the S&amp;P 500 index to a 9.5% gain, its biggest rally since 2008.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Greene’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Greene, one of the first lawmakers to file a disclosure since Trump announced his tariffs, is an active trader in stocks, filing eight disclosures so far this year. She’s been particularly bullish on the semiconductor and tech industries.

As of 11:20 a.m. Tuesday in New York, shares of Blackstone, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Tesla traded higher than at any point on that day.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Over the two days, her stock purchases totaled $21,021 to $315,000.
