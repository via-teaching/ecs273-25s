The moves in yields accelerated as equities slumped more than 2%.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The “bond market is comforted by Powell’s sanguine outlook on funding conditions and reserve abundance, but the equity market is getting anxious as investors are looking for the Powell put — which is not there yet,” said Tracy Chen, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management. “There is no sense of urgency to act from Powell. He is in a wait-and-see mode given all the uncertainty in tariff standoff.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The rally in bonds also followed a solid $13 billion sale of 20-year bonds, which was awarded at 4.81% compared with a 4.814% when-issued yield at the 1 p.m. New York time bidding deadline.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Earlier, data showed US retail sales rose substantially in March on a jump in car purchases and other goods such as electronics, suggesting consumers were scrambling to get ahead of tariffs.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">In sharp contrast with the state of market a week ago, when Trump’s about-face on tariffs shook investors, futures volumes on Wednesday were well below recent levels. By about 3 p.m. New York time, Treasury contracts were running at about 60% of 20-day average, with SOFR futures at a similar level.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">To Gregory Faranello, head of US rates trading and strategy for AmeriVet Securities, the Treasury market is now trading more cleanly than it was earlier in the month as the risk of global tariffs raised threats to the economy, undermining Treasuries’ reputation as the world’s safest asset.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">“Positions feel better balanced, so back to a risk-off” market, he said. Faranello favors five-year notes “if the Fed is going to be reactionary versus preemptive.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Powell’s Message</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Powell’s comments, delivered at the Economic Club of Chicago, were in sharp focus across Wall Street after a bout of volatility in the $29 trillion Treasury market.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The Fed chief acknowledged that tension was building between the central bank’s dual mandates of ensuring US growth while keeping inflation checked.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Still, he echoed Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, who’d pointed out that there’s good reason for officials to hold interest rates at current levels until there is more clarity on how tariffs and other policy changes will impact the economy.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Traders were pricing in about 90 basis points of easing by the end of the year, implying a minimum of three quarter-point reductions starting in July. At JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., economist Michael Feroli said that Powell’s comments were consistent with the bank’s view that the first cut of the year will actually come in September.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Powell said that despite recent volatility, the market was functioning, so there wasn’t a need for the Fed to step in now. The remark jolted US equity markets, and helped fuel a further advance in bonds.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">The dollar, meanwhile, held tight to its losses — bringing its year-to-date decline to 6.4%, according to a Bloomberg gauge.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">He also said the Fed’s recent decision to slow the pace of its balance-sheet runoff — known as quantitative tightening — and the fact that reserves remain abundant mean the central bank can continue QT longer.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">--With assistance from James Hirai.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">(Updates prices, adds comments throughout.)</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-rapid_p="16" data-ylk="slk:GM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-04-14/inside-gm-mary-barra-s-35-billion-bet-on-electric-cars?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-rapid_p="17" data-ylk="slk:Trade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/us-china-trade-war-clears-path-for-sodium-ion-batteries?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Trade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-rapid_p="18" data-ylk="slk:How Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/mar-a-lago-membership-fees-help-explain-trump-s-tariff-obsession?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">How Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-rapid_p="19" data-ylk="slk:Trump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-09/doge-government-cuts-are-pushing-out-the-wrong-people?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Trump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><a class="link" data-rapid_p="20" data-ylk="slk:The Beauty Salon Recession Indicator;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-11/recession-indicator-us-hairstylists-report-clients-cut-spending?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Beauty Salon Recession Indicator</a></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">©2025 Bloomberg L.P.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">Trump's Treasury secretary wants business owners to relax.

An email from Krebs, posted to SentinelOne's website, said he offered his resignation last week after Trump singled Krebs and SentinelOne out for punishment, part of a campaign of retribution aimed at former officials that Trump has deemed insufficiently loyal.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">(Reuters) -The ripple effects of Donald Trump's global trade war are increasingly being felt across numerous industries all at once and on Wednesday were once again exerting pressure on U.S. stock markets that have been roiled for weeks by his erratic trade policies.  Stocks fell broadly, with tech stocks hit particularly hard after bellwethers like Nvidia that are highly tied into the world's supply chain warned of hits to their bottom line.  Meanwhile, airlines said they are bracing for an uncertain summer travel season, and the head of the Federal Reserve noted slowing economic activity - but also cast a wary eye on the threat that tariffs pose to its goal of lowering inflation.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">Demand for coal has been hampered by consumers switching to cheaper natural gas stockpiles for energy, but that trend is expected to change after U.S. President Donald Trump signed executive orders earlier this month aiming to boost coal production.  "CSX faced operational challenges to start the year, which contributed to first quarter results that did not meet our expectations," CEO Joe Hinrichs said in a statement.  Intermodal shipping, which involves two or more means of transportation for goods, saw a 2.1% rise in volume during the quarter, while that of coal fell 8.5%.</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">A family-owned and -operated Florida trucking company has announced it will close after 44 years in business.

"We're running very large deficits at full employment, and this is a situation that we very much need to address" Powell said at an event at the Economic Club of Chicago.  "All of this domestic discretionary spending, which is essentially where 100% of the conversation is, is small as a percentage of federal spending and is declining ... When people are focusing on cutting domestic spending, they're not actually working on the problem."</p>, <p class="clamp yf-1y7058a">Nvidia stock sank after a surprise disclosure it would take a hit north of $5 billion following new chip export restrictions.</p>, <p class="modules-module_tipMessage__ZQFev">Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results</p>, <p class="redirectMsg">Sign in to access your portfolio</p>, <p>
