JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) reported a strong net income of $14.6 billion, with an EPS of $5.07, reflecting robust financial performance.
Revenue increased by 8% year-on-year to $46 billion, driven by higher asset management fees and investment banking fees.
The firm maintained a high CET1 ratio of 15.4%, demonstrating strong capital adequacy.
Consumer and small business segments remain financially healthy, with spending and credit utilization in line with expectations.
The asset and wealth management division reported a 12% increase in revenue, driven by strong net inflows and higher market levels.
Net interest income excluding markets was down by $430 million or 2%, impacted by lower rates and deposit margin compression.
Credit costs increased to $3.3 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.3 billion, indicating rising credit risk.
Expenses rose by 4% to $23.6 billion, largely due to higher compensation and legal expenses.
The investment banking outlook remains cautious due to elevated market uncertainty and client hesitancy.
Home lending originations dropped 42% year-on-year, reflecting challenges in the housing market.
Q: Can you amplify the macro commentary and discuss how uncertainty is affecting customer activity and growth expectations?A: Jeremy Barnum, CFO, noted that recent news has led to some distortions in consumer spending data, with front-loading of spending due to expected price increases from tariffs. On the corporate side, clients are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, focusing on short-term adjustments rather than strategic priorities, which affects the investment banking pipeline.
Q: How does the current macro uncertainty impact your NII ex markets guidance of $90 billion?A: Despite the curve now including three rate cuts, which should create a headwind for NII ex markets, the guidance remains unchanged due to favorable balance effects, such as higher wholesale deposit balances and outperforming beta in CDs and wholesale. The removal of a placeholder for potential card late fee rule impacts also offsets some of the headwinds.
Q: Jamie, can you elaborate on how the banking system can be a source of strength during economic turbulence?A: Jamie Dimon, CEO, emphasized that while a recessionary environment is generally negative for bank equity performance, the banking system's financial strength allows it to support clients and the economy. He highlighted that banks are well-capitalized to handle potential credit losses and continue serving clients.
Q: With rising recession risks, why is there no change to the full-year credit card net charge-off forecast?A: Jeremy Barnum explained that the forecast is based on current data and acknowledges a wide range of potential outcomes. Mechanically, card charge-offs are baked in a few quarters ahead, so even if unemployment rises, it may not immediately impact charge-offs.
Q: How does macro uncertainty affect your capital deployment strategy, particularly regarding investments and buybacks?A: Jamie Dimon stated that investments in technology, AI, and branches will continue regardless of the environment. The bank maintains excess capital to navigate turbulence and serve clients, with flexibility to adjust buybacks based on market conditions.
Q: Are there any changes in consumer credit card spending patterns, particularly in travel?A: Jeremy Barnum noted a decline in airline travel spend, which aligns with airline reports of headwinds. However, this may not indicate broader patterns. There is also some front-loading of spending on items expected to increase in price due to tariffs.
Q: How do you view the proposed SLR changes and their impact on your treasury purchasing appetite?A: Jamie Dimon mentioned that SLR changes alone won't significantly impact JPMorgan. Broader reforms across SLR, G-SIB, CCAR, and Basel III are needed to enhance market intermediation. The bank's treasury purchasing strategy remains focused on client needs rather than regulatory changes.
Q: What is your outlook for the markets business given recent volatility and client risk-taking behavior?A: Jeremy Barnum stated that while the markets business benefits from volatility, client risk aversion could be a headwind. The bank will continue managing risks and serving clients, with no specific market guidance provided.

Stocks are rising worldwide Monday after President Donald Trump relaxed some of his tariffs, for now at least, and as stress from within the U.S. bond market seems to be easing.  Apple and other technology companies helped lift Wall Street after Trump said he was exempting smartphones, computers and some other electronics from some of his stiff tariffs, which could ultimately more than double prices for U.S. customers of many goods coming from China.  Stock markets in other countries likewise bounced following the cooldown in Trump’s trade war with China, the world’s second-largest economy.
