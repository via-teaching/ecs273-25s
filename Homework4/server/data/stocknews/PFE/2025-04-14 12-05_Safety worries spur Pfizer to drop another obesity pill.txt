By abandoning danuglipron, Pfizer has now given up on two oral weight loss medicines since 2023, setting back its plans to compete with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.
Danuglipron’s development has already been a roller coaster ride for Pfizer. Testing of a twice-daily regimen revealed ahigh rate of side effects in Phase 2 studies. Pfizer was confident aonce-daily formulationwould perform better, however. Last year, CEO Albert Bourla claimed the company could besecond to market, behind only Lilly, with an obesity pill.
Pfizer will now have to look elsewhere. The company said the frequency of liver enzyme elevations, a sign of possible organ damage, in testing of danuglipron was “in-line” with other obesity medicines. But the “totality of information” from the danuglipron trials, the case of possible liver damage and recent input from regulators have led it to discontinue development, the company said.
Pfizer still has other candidates in its pipeline. One pill targeting a gut hormone called GIP is in Phaes 2 testing, while another GLP-1 drug it’s working on withNxera Pharmais in Phase 1. The company is also searching for obesity drugs through abroad alliance with startup creator Flagship Pioneering.
Nonetheless, the setback sparked speculation among Wall Street analysts that Pfizer might turn to deals for new obesity medicines, particularly if the drugs in its pipeline have a similar molecular structure to danuglipron. Shares of Viking Therapeutics, Altimmune, Structure Therapeutics and Metsera — all of which have weight loss drugs in clinical testing — rose in trading Monday.
Viking hasinjectable and oral obesity drugsin advanced testing, whileAltimmune has released promising Phase 2 datafor a dual-acting treatment. Structure releasedpositive Phase 2 data last year, and Metsera had strong enough data from along-acting GLP-1 shotit’s developing that it was able to raise$275 million in an initial public offeringin January.
