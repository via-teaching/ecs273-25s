Key Points If you're a dividend investor, now can be an ideal time to go bargain-hunting. The stock market is in the midst of a broad sell-off, with investors dumping all types of stocks, both bad ones and good ones. Fear has taken over, and while it may seem like a terrible time to buy, it may actually be a great one, especially if you're looking for stocks to buy and hold for the long haul. Three dividend stocks that are near their 52-week lows and which may make for solid income-generating investments are Pfizer (PFE 2.75%), Lockheed Martin (LMT 4.30%), and Rogers Communications (RCI 1.30%). Here's what you need to know about these stocks and why they are worth buying for their dividend income. One of the most attractive dividend yields you can find on the markets right now comes from Pfizer. At 7.5%, it's paying you more than five times the S&P 500 average of 1.4%. It's a mouthwatering payout, and the big question for investors comes down to whether it's safe or if it's too good to be true and due for a cut. Based on the stock's more than 16% decline this year (as of Monday), investors don't appear convinced that Pfizer's dividend is safe, not with the new government potentially taking a tough stance on healthcare and vaccines in general. The stock's payout ratio is more than 100%, which may also be concerning. But that's due to multiple one-time expenses, including asset impairment charges and restructuring costs. The healthcare company is expecting its top line to be fairly stable in 2025 and says it's on track to generate $4.5 billion in cost savings by the end of the year due to its Cost Realignment Program. CEO Albert Bourla previously referred to the company's dividend as a "sacred cow," suggesting that it is an important priority to keep it going. While there will be some risk as Pfizer faces patent expirations on key products, it has been investing in developing and growing its pipeline of future drugs.  Pfizer is a bit of an underrated, contrarian pick that investors can get at an attractive valuation. Not only did it recently hit a new 52-week low, but it's also trading at less than 8 times its estimated future earnings (based on analyst expectations). When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 731% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 146% for the S&P 500.

Its dividend yield isn't as high as Pfizer's, but at over 3%, you're still getting a fairly attractive payout from the company.  While President Donald Trump has been vocal about cutting costs from government spending, he's also been a strong proponent of securing the country's borders and focusing on defense -- priorities that Lockheed Martin can benefit from. The company is expecting single-digit growth this year and for free cash flow to total at least $6.6 billion, up from $5.3 billion in 2024.  The stock's payout ratio is fairly modest at 57% of earnings, and with stable growth ahead, it looks like one of the safer income stocks to own right now. As of Monday, the stock was down 12% since the start of the year, but that may be primarily due to the broader market sell-off, as this still looks like a solid investment to buy and hold. Canadian-based telecom giant Rogers Communications yields 5.4%. It is down 17% this year and hit a new 52-week low recently, but overall, its operations are stable, and historically, this has been a low-volatility stock to own. Concerns about the economy and high interest rates are weighing on the stock, but the company's fundamentals are strong. Rogers has reported a profit totaling 1.7 billion Canadian dollars over the trailing 12 months, which is more than 8% of its top line (CA$20.6 billion). Its payout ratio of 63% is fairly modest and sustainable, even if it experiences a slowdown due to challenging economic conditions ahead.  Telecom stocks as a whole have been struggling in recent years, and Rogers' stock is trading at levels it hasn't been at since 2009. But as a top Canadian operator, there's little worry about its competitiveness and ability to generate strong results in the long run. This is a deep-value buy that investors shouldn't overlook.
