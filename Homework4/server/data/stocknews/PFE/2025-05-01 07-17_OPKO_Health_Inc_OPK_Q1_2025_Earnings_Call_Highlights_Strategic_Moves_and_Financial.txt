Q: What are some possible explanations for the negative dynamics for NGENLA? Is it more likely competition, access issues, or something commercial related to Pfizer? A: Adam Logal, CFO, explained that the growth rates of prescriptions for both NGENLA and GENOTROPIN continue, suggesting the issue might be related to the commercial environment. They expect this to be a first-quarter-only event, which is why the guidance was only slightly reduced.
Q: Could you comment on why Pfizer withdrew their EU application for the adult setting and what are the plans for expansion into additional settings?
