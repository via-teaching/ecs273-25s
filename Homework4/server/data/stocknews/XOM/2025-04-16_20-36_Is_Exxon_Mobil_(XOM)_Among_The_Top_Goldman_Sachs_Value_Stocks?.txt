Near the end of March 2025, artificial intelligence stocks that had taken the market over by storm faced losses, while undervalued stocks gained momentum. Similarly, hedge fund managers believe that now is the time to invest in value stocks, with cheap equities available across all industries. Banks, energy, consumer durables, healthcare, and media companies offer lucrative investment opportunities.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">So, what is value investing? Matthew Fine, portfolio manager at Third Avenue Management, describes it as identifying companies trading at a notable discount to a conservative estimate of their true value. These opportunities often arise when a business, industry, or region faces challenges that cause investors to overreact and assume current difficulties will persist long-term. This pessimism creates chances to invest at attractive valuations. While broader equity markets currently appear overvalued, largely driven by the United States, Third Avenue sees overlooked value in many individual companies. Despite a rocky economy, the fund manager believes many quality businesses have become even cheaper, offering compelling opportunities for patient investors. However, the key is to avoid buying a company that seems cheap just because it has temporary advantages that might not last.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Warren Buffett is the king of value investing, and back in 2023, he commented in his annual shareholder meeting that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things”. Buffett’s <a class="link" data-rapid_p="15" data-ylk="slk:Berkshire;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/berkshire-hathaway/1/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Berkshire</a> picks up stocks when others are panic-selling their holdings, and although the Oracle of Omaha understands that the world is rapidly changing, he still sees several value investing opportunities.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Overall, the stock market is in mayhem because of the uncertainty brought on by US trade wars and tariffs. However, institutional investors like Goldman Sachs align with the market perspective and have a thriving $634 billion portfolio.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Aerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">To compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top value stock picks, we searched the investment firm’s Q4 2024 portfolio, starting from the top and assessing the PE ratios as of April 11. From there, we chose the top 12 stocks with PE ratios of 25 or under as Goldman Sachs' value picks. We have also mentioned the Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment around the holdings for further insight. The list is ranked in ascending order of Goldman Sachs’ stake value.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (<strong><a class="link" data-rapid_p="17" data-ylk="slk:see more details here;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">see more details here</a></strong>).</p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><b><i>Goldman Sachs' Q4 2024 Stake Value: $2,504,575,163</i></b></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><b><i>P/E Ratio as of April 11: 12.85</i></b></p>, <p class="yf-1090901"><b><i>Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104</i></b></p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), an American multinational oil and gas titan, is one of the best Goldman Sachs value stocks. The investment firm holds 6.5 million shares of XOM worth $2.5 billion as of Q4 2024. On April 4, TD Cowen reiterated a Buy rating on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) but trimmed the price target from $128 to $125. While the company’s financial outlook has slightly shifted, analysts at TD Cowen remain confident in Exxon’s performance and share buyback plans, even if commodity prices dip. They still see it as one of the strongest picks in the energy sector.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">In 2024, ExxonMobil reported $33.7 billion in earnings, slightly less than last year’s $36 billion. The company generated $55 billion in cash from operations and returned $36 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. It also led the industry in shareholder returns over the past 1, 3, and 5 years. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) plans to maintain its $20 billion annual share repurchase program through 2026. XOM raised its dividend for the 42nd straight year and ended 2024 with a $23.2 billion cash balance and low debt levels.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has remodeled its oil and gas portfolio by discarding assets worth $15 billion and focusing on resources like the Permian Basin, Guyana, and LNG. The company’s full-year production came in at 4.3 million BOED, which can potentially reach 5.4 million BOED by 2030. The Pioneer acquisition boosted its Permian position, and innovation is improving recovery rates. XOM also plans to double its LNG capacity through projects in the United States, Papua New Guinea, and Mozambique.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 104 hedge funds held long positions in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), compared to 86 funds in the earlier quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s <strong><a class="link" data-rapid_p="19" data-ylk="slk:First Eagle Investment Management;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/first+eagle+investment+management/168/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">First Eagle Investment Management</a></strong> was a significant stakeholder of the company, with 8.6 million shares valued at roughly $934 million.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Overall, XOM <strong>ranks 6th</strong> among the Goldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks.
