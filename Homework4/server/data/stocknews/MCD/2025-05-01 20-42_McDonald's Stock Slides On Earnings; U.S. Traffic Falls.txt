McDonald's posted mixed Q1 results Thursday with declines in revenue and comparable sales. McDonald's stock slides.
Middle-class and lower-income Americans are in belt-tightening mode.  McDonald’s reported its worst sales since the pandemic for established U.S. restaurants, after anxious middle- and low-income diners cut their spending.  “People are just being more judicious,” McDonald’s Chief Executive  Chris Kempczinski  told investors Thursday.
McDonald's posted a surprise drop in first-quarter global comparable sales on Thursday, as demand from cash-strapped diners in the U.S. and Europe faltered on uncertainty sparked by chaotic tariffs.  The world's largest fast-food chain is navigating the "toughest of market conditions", CEO Chris Kempczinski said as restaurant visits by lower- and middle-income customers fell in double-digit range from last year.  The results echoed warnings from restaurant operators Domino's Pizza, Chipotle Mexican Grill and Starbucks that Americans were spending less to dine out as inflation and bleak economic outlook dent consumer confidence.
MCD's first-quarter 2025 results hurt by decline in comparable guest counts.
McDonald’s  stock fell Thursday after the fast-food restaurant giant posted first-quarter revenue that missed analysts’ expectations and said U.S. comparable sales had declined 3.6% from the previous year.  The decline in U.S. comparable sales was driven by “negative comparable guest counts,”  McDonald’s  said, indicating a drop-off in customer traffic from the same period last year.  Given its reputation for catering to lower-to-middle-income diners, investors might have expected McDonald’s to remain defensive even as the economy is on shaky footing.
CVS Health blew past first-quarter earnings estimates early Thursday, while raising its full-year outlook by a smaller amount.  The pharmacy and health benefits giant also announced an agreement to make Novo Nordisk's Wegovy its preferred GLP-1 obesity medication.  CVS stock is sharply higher, while NVO also jumped in early stock market action.
Adding more items to its menu, including energy drinks and coffee, will help the chain compete with sector rivals and boost profitability.
The fast-food giant’s patrons are “grappling with uncertainty” as spending slows at several restaurant chains.
