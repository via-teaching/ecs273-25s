However, just like the Zacks Rank, the foundation for the Zacks Recommendation is trends in earnings estimate revisions.\nThe Zacks Recommendation classifies stocks into three groups — Outperform, Neutral and Underperform.

Despite higher borrowing costs, the economy has avoided flashing recessionary signals. This is the much-desired soft landing that many investors hoped for. The recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November 2024) have bolstered the stock market, making 2024 a strong year for equities. Donald Trump’s presidential win in November sparked additional market gains, sending indices to record highs in the days following his victory.

    "content": "Title: Chili’s trolls McDonald’s with its new quarter pounder burger\nDate: 2025-04-15 13:00\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/food/chilis-mcdonalds-qb-burger?.tsrc=rss\nContent:\nMarkets \n\n\n\nHot Stocks \n\n\n\nFear & Greed Index \n\n\n\n\n            Latest Market News \n\n\n\n\n            Hot Stocks \n\n\n\nFollow:\n\n            Chili’s is ratcheting up its fight against fast food rivals with a new cheeseburger that might make McDonald’s call their lawyers.\n    \n\n            The chain is rolling out Tuesday the Big QP burger, which not only has a similar name to McDonald’s Quarter Pounder but also the same toppings: two slices of American cheese, pickles, ketchup and diced onions. Chili’s says in a press release that its version has 85% more beef, making it “even more value-packed” than the fast food classic.\n    \n\n            The Big QP is being added to Chili’s popular “3 for Me,” a $10.99 meal that includes the burger, fries, unlimited chips and free refills of a soft drink. The deal exploded in popularity last year when Chili’s took aim at customers of its fast food rivals (notably McDonald’s)  who might be turned off by their rising prices.\n    \n\n            And while the meal might be more expensive than a McDonald’s Quarter Pounder, which costs around $5 to $7 depending on the city, it’s comparable in price to a combo meal with medium fries and medium-sized soft drink.\n    \n\n            Chili’s directly jabbed McDonald’s in its press release, calling the $10.99 deal “less expensive than a comparable meal at McDonald’s” as well as releasing TV ads that call the Quarter Pounder “tiny.”\n    \n\n            The Big QP is the second McDonald’s-inspired burger from Chili’s. Last year, the chain added a Big Mac-like burger called the Big Smasher, rolling out a cheeky ad campaign that directly called out the Big Mac. Ultimately, that proved a successful gambit, with the Big Smasher helping Chili’s register a 15% jump in same-store sales following its release.\n    \n\n            Chili’s is likely hoping to sustain its skyrocketing sales by continuing this rivalry. Sales in its most recent quarter jumped 31%, marking the chain’s third-straight quarter of double-digit growth. Shares of Brinker International (EAT), its parent company, have soared 200% over the past year.\n    \n\nRelated article\nChili’s and Applebee’s are fighting about their value meals\n\n\n            Once trailing flashier rivals, Chili’s is pulling off its comeback thanks to these deals, plus revamped chicken tender recipes and viral TikToks of its “Triple Dipper” appetizer. The chain also recently opened a location in Scranton, Pennsylvania inspired by “The Office.”\n\n\n            This success stands in contrast to most casual dining chains. Typically catering to lower and middle-income families looking for a sit-down meal, diners have been abandoning these companies in recent years. These restaurants have been hiking menu prices at the same time their customer base is being squeezed by the rising cost of living, resulting in several bankruptcies, including Hooters, TGI Fridays and Buca di Beppo.\n    \n\n            Although McDonald’s hasn’t directly responded to Chili’s, the chain recently added a “McValue” menu category in hopes of turning around its sluggish sales. In addition to the $5 meal deal, the menu also has a “Buy One, Add One for $1” option and more locally targeted promotions from its franchises.\n    \nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

On Monday, the stock’s closing price of $316.07 was above its 50-day moving average of $305.19 and the 200-day moving average of $288.64.Despite the market volatility and cautious sentiment due to macroeconomic uncertainty, including tariff concerns and potential recession risks, investors have been optimistic about McDonald's. The company has been gaining from internal efforts focused on its Accelerating the Arches plan, introducing menu items, offering better value deals and expanding its presence across the global markets.\n \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n \nOver the past three months, MCD shares have gained 13% compared the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry’s 0.6% rise. Over the same period, the stock has fared better than the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s 6.9% dip and the S&P 500 index’s 9.3% decline.\n \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n \nThe MCD stock has outperformed some industry players in the past three months, including Restaurant Brands International Inc. QSR, The Wendy's Company WEN and Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG. In the said time frame, shares of Restaurant Brands have gained 4.2%, while Wendy's and Chipotle have tumbled 12.6% and 14%, respectively.Can McDonald's recent performance signal a continued upward trajectory? Let us explore the key factors that can drive the stock's growth and strengthen investor confidence in the near term.\nMCD is focused on expanding its global presence, aiming to enhance growth through the latest openings and upgrades to existing locations. This strategy supports the company’s continued performance despite challenging conditions. In 2024, McDonald's opened 2,116 restaurants, an increase from 2,067 in 2023. This growth reflects the company’s focus on expanding its global footprint through the Restaurant Development pillar of its Accelerating the Arches Strategy.Going forward, McDonald's aims to accelerate its pace of restaurant openings to meet growing demand across key markets. In 2025, the company plans to open 2,200 restaurants globally, contributing more than 4% to new unit growth, net of closures. It continues to build on its industry-leading development, targeting 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027, marking the fastest growth phase in its history.\nMcDonald's continues to strengthen its brand by enhancing core menu offerings and improving customer experience. With a focus on value, variety and operational efficiency, the company is working to boost customer engagement and drive long-term growth. In January 2025, MCD launched the McValue platform in the United States, designed to provide customers with more flexible options and consistent value.MCD is enhancing its delivery services to provide greater convenience and improve the customer experience. With an emphasis on expanding delivery options and strengthening digital capabilities, the company is focused on creating seamless ways for customers to access its offerings.Over the past year, the delivery sales mix has doubled in Australia, Canada and the United States. McDonald's expects to increase the percentage of system-wide delivery sales originating from its mobile app to 30% by 2027.\nMcDonald's is leveraging its loyalty program and digital initiatives to drive customer retention and expand its base. By enhancing the customer experience across multiple channels, the company is creating more value for loyalty members and increasing engagement through innovative digital solutions.Since launching its loyalty program, MCD has seen significant growth, with more than 170 million 90-day active users. In 2024, sales to loyalty members reached $30 billion. With the continued rise in digital adoption, McDonald's is optimistic about the long-term success of its loyalty program. The company expects to expand its active user base to 250 million and achieve $45 billion in annual sales by 2027.\n \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n \nAnalysts are becoming more optimistic about MCD’s earnings outlook. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for McDonald's 2025 EPS has increased from $12.23 to $12.25, implying a 4.5% year-over-year increase. The momentum is set to continue into 2026, with earnings anticipated to climb 8.2% year over year to $13.25 per share.\nMcDonald's is currently valued at a premium compared with its industry on a forward 12-month price-to-earnings basis. The company’s forward 12-month P/E ratio stands at 25.21X, slightly higher than the industry’s average of 25.12X. The premium valuation reflects the company’s consistent performance, strong position in key markets and earnings growth potential. Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands, Wendy's and Chipotle are trading at P/E ratios of 16.61X, 12.83X, and 36.81X, respectively.\n \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGiven MCD's strong global expansion strategy, focus on menu innovation and digital initiatives, the company is well-positioned for continued growth. Restaurant openings, digital enhancements and the successful loyalty program show promising long-term prospects.However, the company is facing challenges with weaker comparable store sales growth, as global comps edged down 0.1% in 2024 against 9% growth in the prior year. Additionally, macroeconomic uncertainty and market volatility could weigh on short-term performance.Considering McDonald's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), investors may want to stay cautious while monitoring the company's ability to capitalize on its growth opportunities in the coming quarters.

CMG stock's premium valuation — trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 36.81X — has raised eyebrows, especially as the restaurant industry braces for potential disruption from renewed trade tensions and tariff threats. The stock is trading above the Zacks Retail-Restaurant industry’s average of 25.12X and the broader Retail-Wholesale sector’s 22.11X.The warning signals come as restaurant chains, including peers like Brinker International, Inc. EAT, McDonald's Corporation MCD and Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM face dual threats: slowing discretionary spending and geopolitical risk. Looming macroeconomic risks, concerns around inflation, retaliatory tariffs, and rising labor costs are beginning to cast a shadow over CMG’s near-term prospects.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSo far this year, shares of Chipotle have declined 18.1% compared with the Zacks Retail – Restaurants industry’s fall of 1.5%. The stock has underperformed the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s and the S&P 500’s declines of 5.7% and 8.4%, respectively.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a technical perspective, Chipotle stock is currently trading below its 50-day moving average, signaling a bearish trend.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAnalysts and investors alike are starting to question how sustainable Chipotle’s momentum is under these conditions. Let’s find out.\nMacro Pressures Are Building: The broader economic environment is starting to catch up with even the most resilient players. Inflation remains sticky, interest rates are still elevated, and consumers are becoming more price-conscious. As a premium fast-casual brand, Chipotle is particularly vulnerable to this shift.Declining profitability remains a concern for CMG. During the fourth quarter of 2024, Restaurant-level margins contracted 60 basis points year over year to 24.8%, weighed down by rising input costs and portion-related investments. Despite promises of back-half relief from initiatives like produce slicers and back-of-house modernization, management expects margin pressure to linger into the first half of 2025.While many restaurant chains are seeing signs of consumer trade-down behavior, Chipotle has continued to raise menu prices to offset inflationary pressures. This strategy worked well during earlier waves of inflation, but there are signs that consumer tolerance for higher prices may be peaking. The brand's value perception is at risk, especially as grocery inflation moderates and home cooking becomes a more attractive alternative for budget-minded customers.\nTariff Troubles on the Horizon: Chipotle may also find itself caught in the crosshairs of geopolitical trade friction. With about 2% of Chipotle’s product cost tied to imports from Mexico — including avocados, tomatoes and peppers — the newly announced tariffs could shave an additional 60 basis points off margins if implemented fully. While management has done commendable work diversifying suppliers, the risk remains non-trivial. A spike in input costs could pressure margins and force further price hikes, which may not be well received by customers already feeling the pinch.Other major chains like Brinker, YUM! Brands and McDonald's have acknowledged the potential impact of tariffs, suggesting broader industry-wide implications. Chipotle, despite its nimbleness, is not immune to these macro-level risks.\nChipotle’s 2025 earnings per share (EPS) estimates have been revised downward, dropping from $1.29 to $1.27 over the past 60 days. This downward trend reflects weakening analyst confidence in the stock’s near-term prospects.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNevertheless, the company is likely to report strong earnings, with projections indicating 13.4% year-over-year growth in 2025. Conversely, industry players like Brinker, YUM! Brands and McDonald's are likely to witness a rise of 102.7%, 9.3% and 4.5%, year over year, respectively.\nDespite the concerns, Chipotle is not without its strengths. The company continues to set itself apart by focusing on high-quality, customizable food served quickly in a clean and consistent environment. As part of its broader strategy, Chipotle is doubling down on speed and service through operational upgrades and managerial stability, which are helping drive strong customer loyalty and higher transaction volumes.To further elevate the customer experience, Chipotle has made significant investments in digital innovation and restaurant design. With digital orders now accounting for more than a third of its sales, the company’s mobile app and “Chipotlane” drive-thru pickup windows are creating faster, more convenient ways for customers to engage with the brand. These enhancements not only increase average check sizes but also boost efficiency, contributing to stronger unit economics and improving throughput during peak hours.On the sourcing side, Chipotle has taken early steps to mitigate tariff risk by diversifying avocado suppliers beyond Mexico. While not a full hedge, it does reduce exposure relative to less-prepared peers. Additionally, the brand’s focus on automation and kitchen innovation could help offset wage inflation and maintain unit economics.Chipotle is also positioning itself for global expansion, with promising early traction in Canada, Europe, and the Middle East. By tailoring its strategy for international markets while maintaining its core values, the company is showing that its model can travel. Domestically, it continues to pursue its goal of reaching 7,000 locations, backed by strong unit economics and growing average unit volumes. Together, these efforts are positioning Chipotle for long-term margin expansion and sustainable growth.\nAnalysts maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook on Chipotle’s stock. Based on short-term price targets from 31 analysts, the average price target is $64.84, suggesting a potential upside of 31.1% from the last closing price of $49.46. Price forecasts range from a low of $48.00, indicating a 2.95% downside risk, to a high of $72.00, which represents a possible 45.6% upside. Meanwhile, Chipotle carries a solid average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.52 on a scale of 1 (Strong Buy) to 5 (Strong Sell), reflecting a favorable consensus. Among 32 brokerage firms, 22 analysts rate the stock as a Strong Buy and three as a Buy, underscoring confidence in Chipotle’s growth potential.\nChipotle remains a strong brand within the fast-casual dining space, backed by its commitment to food quality, digital innovation, and long-term expansion plans. Despite current macroeconomic pressures, including inflation, rising labor costs, and looming tariff threats, the company’s proactive steps — such as supplier diversification, automation, and a focus on customer experience — highlight its operational agility and long-term vision. Continued digital investment and international expansion further strengthen its position for future growth.\nThat said, Chipotle’s elevated valuation and recent underperformance relative to its industry and broader market introduce caution into the near-term outlook. Margin pressure, waning consumer tolerance for price hikes and geopolitical uncertainties could weigh on earnings and sentiment in the coming quarters. The stock’s downward earnings estimate revisions and technical weakness add to investment hesitancy.\nGiven these dynamics, existing investors may consider holding on to this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock as Chipotle works through short-term headwinds and executes its strategic initiatives. However, new investors might find it wise to remain on the sidelines until macro risks moderate and momentum begins to recover, especially considering the stock’s premium valuation and recent volatility.\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO) stands against other top restaurant stocks to buy under $20.\nRestaurant stocks are showing volatility amid Trump’s tariff impositions across various sectors. On April 7, CNBC reported that while US stocks are tumbling due to the effects of high tariffs on the import of goods from key trading partners, analysts do not anticipate the tariffs to hit most restaurant stocks directly. However, inflation is expected to follow behind, fueled by expert and investor fear of an impending recession. This may put pressure on the spending capacity of consumers, resulting in an economic downturn.\nCNBC reported that UBS analyst Dennis Geiger said the following in a note to clients:\n“We view the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants as manageable, with a focus on select commodity costs, but see the bigger risk as incremental pressure on consumer spending and industry demand.”\nCNBC also reported that investor concerns affected restaurant stocks across all sectors. Fast food restaurant chains have historically shown the most resilience during recessions, as consumers looking for cheap dining options typically level down from fast-casual or full-service diners and eateries to fast food options. However, the drop in consumer spending witnessed last year saw fast food restaurants hit hard, as low-income consumers cut their spending to this sector, visiting them less frequently. High-income consumers, on the other hand, continued with their usual dining habits, creating a gap that negatively affected fast food companies. Quick-service restaurants thus underwent same-store sales declines.\nOn March 8, Mario Carbone, Major Food Group chef and co-founder, appeared on CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ to discuss the effects of Trump’s tariffs on the food industry and how high-end consumers are behaving in the sector. Talking about New York, he said that the numbers are booming, going above their pre-Covid benchmarks. New York is thus telling us that everything is good, and there is no fear right now in dining in the luxury sector. Stats are up, and restaurants are packed, with consumer energy through the roof. As of right now, there are no signs of slowing at all if one evaluates the spending and trends in restaurant reports.\nHowever, Carbone said that inflation hits the food and restaurant industry just like everyone else. The luxury food sector is responsible to the customer for bringing in the best ingredients for every meal, which is why it has no choice but to pass the effects on to the consumer in case such trends materialize.\nWe sifted through stock screeners, financial media reports, and ETFs to compile a list of 20 restaurant stocks under $20 as of April 13, 2025, and chose the top 10 most popular among hedge funds as of Q4 2024. The list is ordered in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey’s database.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of customers ordering from a McDonald's restaurant in Latin America.\nShare Price: $7.22\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21\nArcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO) is a McDonald’s franchisee operating or franchising more than 2,140 McDonald’s-branded restaurants. Its operations are divided into four geographical categories: Brazil, the Carribean, the North Latin America division (NOLAD), and the South Latin America division (SLAD).\nAnalysts believe that Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc.’s (NYSE:ARCO) stock provides an attractive entry point. The company holds a competitive market edge due to its restaurant portfolio. More than half of its restaurants are free-standing units, which provide a mix of takeout, drive-thru, and delivery service options and boost restaurant sales.\nOn October 1, 2024, the company announced that it would exercise its option to renew its Master Franchise Agreement (MFA) with McDonald’s for another 20 years starting in 2025. This agreement has strengthened the company’s strategic footing, which stems from the geographic diversification of its solid restaurant base throughout Latin America.\nOn April 1, BTG Pactual initiated coverage of Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO) with a Buy rating and a $10.50 price target. Analysts have bullish sentiments for the stock, and their median price target of $7.22 implies an upside of 45.43% from current levels.\nBrennan Asset Management stated the following regarding Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n“Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ARCO): Rough 2024…Shares Substantially Undervalued: ARCO produced solid operating results throughout 2024, but negative currency movements, including a near freefall in the Brazilian Real (over 20 percent decline), drove investors to dump ARCO shares. As we noted in our Q3 letter, ARCO announced that it renewed its master franchise agreement (MFA) with McDonald’s (MCD) at terms that were better than many anticipated. While we won’t rehash the entire ARCO thesis (see our 2023 Q2 and Q3 letters for more color), we continue to believe that ARCO is a unique asset (the license to operate essentially all MCD restaurants from Mexico south) that was turbocharged by COVID’s aftereffects. During and after COVID, a large percentage of restaurants closed and there was rapid adoption of drive-through and delivery sales. ARCO disproportionately benefited, given its larger share of free-standing stores. ARCO has a strong balance sheet (including substantial real-estate value), strong incremental returns on capital and a substantial growth opportunity. Brazil faces macro challenges, and further currency weakness is distinctly possible. That said, ARCO has a history of achieving same[1]store sale growth above inflation rates and Brazil has some of the highest delivery penetration rates and digital adaptation rates in all of LATAM. Furthermore, there is no reason for ARCO not to move its listing from New York to Sao Paulo and greatly neutralize the reporting impact from currency fluctuations. We strongly believe ARCO is mispriced at current levels.”\nOverall, ARCO ranks 6th on our list of the top restaurant stocks to buy under $20. While we acknowledge the potential for ARCO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.
