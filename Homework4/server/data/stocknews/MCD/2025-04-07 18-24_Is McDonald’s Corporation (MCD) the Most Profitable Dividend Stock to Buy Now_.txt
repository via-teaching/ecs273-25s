A dealmaking freeze and the biggest stocks rout since 2023 are raising the stakes for Wall Street’s earnings season We recently published a list of the 8 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stands against other profitable dividend stocks. When it comes to profits, dividend investing is the first thing that springs to mind. Dividends represent a portion of a company’s earnings paid out to its shareholders, and over the years, they’ve come to play a growing role in personal income, with their share increasing notably. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, dividends as a part of personal income has grown from 2.68% in Q4 1980 to 7.88% in Q2 2024, while net interest has fallen from 14.58% to 7.61% during the same timeframe. The report also mentioned that dividends made up more than one-third of the market’s total return from 1936 through 2024, with capital appreciation accounting for the other two-thirds. With the market becoming turbulent today, investors are once again turning their attention to dividend stocks, which had largely been sidelined for the past two years. The last time dividend stocks had their moment was in 2022, but since then, they have been overshadowed by AI stocks. That said, dividend stocks are witnessing a renewed interest because of their stable characteristics. According to Jefferies, dividend-paying stocks can be a good choice in light of the Trump administration’s approach to tariffs. Desh Peramunetilleke, head of the quantitative strategy at Jefferies, emphasized that dividend stocks can make an impression during rough economic patches. His team also supported this idea, believing that dividend stocks would outperform this year, driven by high-quality yield stocks and defensive yield names. Peramunetilleke made the following comment on March 27 note: “A study of past stagflation-like period shows that it is a headwind for equities, but dividend strategies tend to be more resilient. Since 2001, [bond proxies] and [high-quality yield] have outperformed the most during such periods in [the] U.S.” Analysts like Peramunetilleke have noticed this renewed interest in dividends this year. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which follows companies with at least a 25-year track record of dividend growth, has fallen by a little over 4% since the start of 2025, compared with a steeper decline in the broader market. Dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are also in the green. According to a report by Franklin Templeton, between August 2024 and January 2025, dividend ETFs listed in the US attracted average monthly net inflows of nearly $3.3 billion—marking a significant rise from just $107 million during the same stretch a year earlier. The report also mentioned that dividend-focused strategies have repeatedly shown their ability to act as a defensive play, regardless of the region or market cycle. Over the three years ending December 31, 2024, companies that paid dividends experienced less volatility and smaller peak-to-trough declines than the broader market across global, US, and European benchmarks. When inflation concerns and interest rate jitters resurfaced in August 2024, dividend stocks proved more resilient than most, weathering the storm better than the wider market. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best profitable stocks that pay dividends. A cook in a busy kitchen assembling cheeseburgers for orders. Our Methodology: For this list, we screened for stable dividend companies that have strong dividend growth track records.

Net Profit Margin: 31.73% McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a multinational fast food chain that operates nearly 43,000 locations globally. The company, recognized worldwide for its golden arches, is making a strong push into artificial intelligence, as highlighted by The Wall Street Journal. For a fast-food giant like McDonald’s, AI holds potential across various operations. Around 18 months ago, the company entered a partnership with Alphabet’s Google Cloud, placing a strong emphasis on AI. The company has already tested AI-powered ordering, and this collaboration may help the company scale up those efforts. If AI proves effective in handling orders, it could help cut down labor costs while improving the customer experience. Despite its innovation drive, McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)’s quarterly results came in below expectations, partly due to an E. Coli outbreak, though the company faced broader headwinds as well. In Q4 2024, revenue came in at $6.4 billion—a modest 0.2% dip year-over-year and nearly $88 million short of analyst forecasts. Global same-store sales, which reflect performance at established locations, inched up by 0.4%. However, US same-store sales dropped by 1.4%, indicating a slowdown in domestic growth and ongoing pressure to maintain momentum. However, it is one of the stocks that have shown positive returns this year, surging by over 2% since the start of 2025. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has a strong cash reserve with over $1 billion available in cash and cash equivalents at the end of FY24. The company has been growing its payouts for 48 consecutive years, which makes it one of the most profitable stocks on our list. It offers a quarterly dividend of $1.77 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.36%, as of April 6. Overall, MCD ranks 8th on our list of the best dividend stocks from the regional banking sector. While we acknowledge the potential of MCD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than MCD but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.
