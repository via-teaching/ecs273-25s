Hansen focused some of his questioning on emails sent by Zuckerberg and his associates that the FTC cited in earlier testimony to illustrate the Facebook founder's alarm over the growth of Instagram and his sense that he needed to neutralize its threat.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) stock reached an all-time high price of $207.05 on Feb. 4, riding a wave of strong growth and earnings momentum from 2024.

They analyzed deepfake ad scams involving public figure impersonations and developed countermeasures. \nThe company introduced technical countermeasures and over 30 ads and publisher policy updates last year. These moves helped suspend over 700,000 offending advertising accounts, leading to a 90% drop in reports of deepfake ads, the company claims.\nIn the U.S. alone, Google said it suspended 39.2 million advertiser accounts and took down 1.8 billion ads last year, with key violations tied to ad network abuse, trademark misuse, healthcare claims, personalized ads, and misrepresentation.\nIndia, the world‚Äôs most populous country and the second biggest internet market after China in terms of users, saw 2.9 million account suspensions last year, Google said, making it the second-highest after the U.S. The company also removed 247.4 million ads in India, with the top five policy violations related to financial services, trademark misuse, ad network abuse, personalized ads, and gambling and games.\nOf all the advertiser account suspensions, Google said it suspended 5 million accounts for scam-related violations.\nOverall, the company removed almost half a billion ads related to scams.\nGoogle also verified more than 8,900 new election advertisers in 2024, which saw half of the world‚Äôs population go to the polls, and removed 10.7 million election ads. However, Rodriguez noted that the volume of election ads compared to Google‚Äôs overall ad numbers was relatively small and would not significantly impact its safety metrics this year.\nIn total, Google said it blocked 5.1 billion ads last year and removed 1.3 billion pages. In comparison, it blocked over 5.5 billion ads and took action against 2.1 billion publisher pages in 2023.\nGoogle told TechCrunch that the decreasing numbers indicated improvements in its prevention efforts. By improving early detection and suspension of malicious accounts, fewer harmful ads are produced or reach the platform, the company said.\nThe company also restricted 9.1 billion ads last year, it said. \nImportantly, large-scale suspensions sometimes spark concerns over how fairly a company applies its rules. Google said it offers an appeal process that includes human reviews to ensure it took ‚Äúappropriate action.‚Äù\n‚ÄúOftentimes, some of our message wasn‚Äôt as clear and transparent about specifics, about what the rationale was, or reasoning, and sometimes that left the advertiser a little more confused.

(GOOG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned -2.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has lost 5.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.06 per share, indicating a change of +9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.6% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.87 points to a change of +10.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.17 indicates a change of +14.6% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $75.53 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $331.22 billion and $368.31 billion estimates indicate +12.2% and +11.2% changes, respectively.\nAlphabet reported revenues of $81.62 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.9%. EPS of $2.15 for the same period compares with $1.64 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81.38 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.3%. The EPS surprise was +1.42%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned -2.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has lost 5.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.04 per share, indicating a change of +7.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.6% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.88 points to a change of +10.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.17 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $75.53 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.8%. The $326.8 billion and $363.24 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.7% and +11.2%, respectively.\nAlphabet reported revenues of $81.62 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.9%. EPS of $2.15 for the same period compares with $1.64 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81.38 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.3%. The EPS surprise was +1.42%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025.\nOn April 4, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives appeared on CNBC to discuss the potential impact of current tariffs and compared the situation to an economic armageddon. If the current tariffs remain in place, Ives thinks it would lead to a 15% to 20% demand reduction across the board. He thinks that investor anxiety is much higher considering how things were in the March 2020 COVID-19 crash earlier. The analyst thinks that investors should now focus on the likelihood of tariff adjustments from comments about negotiations, the impact on consumer-focused companies, and the potential for demand destruction. He even thinks that companies may refuse to provide guidance in the first-quarter earnings calls due to the persistent tariff uncertainty.\nIves thinks that a lot of tech companies will not be able to absorb high tariff increases and rather this cost will be passed on to the consumers which will lead to significant margin erosion and even potential sales declines. He indicated that tech stocks are currently pricing in a 10% to 15% cut to numbers. He suggests that investors should now look at companies with strong long-term potential as he believes earnings may normalize in 2025 and 2026. The analyst also addressed the defensive performance of defense contractors. While acknowledging the relative stability here, Ives cautioned that even these even such sectors are not immune to tariffs. He noted the significant foreign component, specifically 40% to 50% in some instances, in hardware and other sectors.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through the financial media reports to compile a list of the top NASDAQ stocks to buy for 2025. We then selected the 13 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on.

The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey‚Äôs database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a tech company that operates through three segments. The Google Services segment provides products and services like ads, Chrome, Gmail, and YouTube. The Google Cloud segment offers AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, cybersecurity, and data & analytics, among others. The Other Bets segment sells healthcare-related and internet services.\nOn March 31, Ken Gawrelski, an analyst at Wells Fargo, reaffirmed an Equal Weight rating on the company while lowering the price target to $167 from $184. This cautious sentiment is a result of the company‚Äôs current trough multiples and bearish investor sentiment. This is because they believe that Google‚Äôs search business is put at risk by new AI-related technologies.\nHowever, the increasing demand for AI infrastructure and GenAI solutions has improved the adoption of GCP (Google Cloud Platform). GCP recently outpaced the entire cloud market. The company‚Äôs overall Cloud segment rose by 30$ year-over-year in Q4 2024. Notably, the company‚Äôs 6th-gen TPU called Trillium enhances AI workload significantly.

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The fund‚Äôs investor class returned 1.14% in the first quarter, compared to a -4.27% return for the S&P 500 Index. The fund has returned 12.76% since its inception compared to the index return of 10.44% over the same period.

The one-month return of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was -4.57%, and its shares lost 0.85% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On April 15, 2025, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock closed at $158.68 per share with a market capitalization of $1.918 trillion.\nOakmark Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q1 2025 investor letter:\n\"Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was the top detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered company‚Äôs stock price declined despite having posted fourth-quarter 2024 earnings that were in line with consensus expectations. Search revenue growth remained strong, and management reiterated that the new ‚ÄúAI Overviews‚Äù feature is driving higher engagement with comparable monetization. The one miss during the quarter was in the Cloud segment, where revenue grew 30% year-over-year but fell slightly short of consensus expectations. We believe the shortfall was largely due to short-term capacity constraints and that the long-term growth outlook for Google Cloud remains robust. We continue to see Alphabet as a collection of great businesses that can further benefit from the company‚Äôs world class AI capabilities.

A massive UK class action claims Google weaponized its default search engine status to freeze out competitors and force British businesses to overpay for digital ads. Filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal, the lawsuit says Google struck deals with Android phone makers and paid Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to make its search engine the default across devices, locking in market control and pushing ad prices higher than they should've been.\nLeading the charge is competition law expert Or Brook, who argues UK businesses had no real choice: if you wanted visibility online, you had to play by Google's rulesand pay up. The claim alleges that Google built a walled garden around search ads, where it not only dominated volume (over 90% of UK searches) but also offered enhanced functionality only through its own channels. Over 200,000 businesses are said to have been impacted. Brook didn't hold back: Google has been leveraging its dominance in the general search and search advertising market to overcharge advertisers.\nGoogle's response? Predictable. The company called the lawsuit speculative and opportunistic, and insists people use Google because it's helpfulnot because they're forced to. But the timing couldn't be worse. Britain's Competition and Markets Authority is already investigating Google's grip on digital ads, and the global antitrust spotlight on Big Tech is only getting brighter.

US stocks opening in the red this morning with tech leading the losses here. Options data showing investors are positioning for further losses in mega cap tech and semis ahead of earnings. That's according to data from Bloomberg. Joining us now with more, David Harden, Summit Global Investments CIO. David, great to speak with you this morning. Certainly a lot of pain for the big tech names this morning.\nThank you.\nAre you buying big tech at these levels?\nWell, I think there's some definitely buying opportunities that are coming available. For example, one of the things that I like is Google. Google has $25 billion in free cash flows last quarter. It's it's it's growing at double digits year-over-year. Its profit margins are great. Its return on equity is around 30%. And the PE is now finally getting down into those reasonable levels you can consider 16, 17, 15. So I think I think these are buying opportunities to start accumulating more positions in something like a Google.\nI think what you're highlighting is the, you know, this one thing is not like the other in the tech trade even as you're looking at what is more of a platform play where there's perhaps more of a reason to believe that the consumers would flow into free products that a Google might offer online versus what we're seeing in some of the products and propensity to spend in some of the other tech plays where there might be a consumer pullback in those discretionary dollars. How do you continue to look across these companies once we get into earnings and see how they're forecasting and guiding for the rest of the year on that?\nYeah, I think that's really important because where did their earnings come from, right? And and how are they tied to tariffs? That's really important. And how does those tariffs impact like advertising for Google. So you want to look kind of through those earnings into the consumer and and see what that consumer's doing and how that consumer's acting. And I think that's another play in tech. There is a separation. What? Are they hardware? Like Apple's had to navigate a lot more tariff news than Google's had to navigate, even though they're both navigating it.\nAnd we're starting to see individual companies being used as tools in this trade war. Obviously with Nvidia's specific chips being impacted by export controls, to what extent does that change any fundamental view you have on these stocks or should investors look past any of that daily headline news on tariffs?\nI I I think absolutely, you have to consider that and you have to manage your your risk here. Risk is really, really important in these markets and managing that is essential. So where you have the H20 chip, for example, invidia, they have clearly shown last night on their earnings that they have a difficult time more difficult time than some of these other tech names. So look for tech names that are more US based. Look for tech names that have more um say high-quality earnings. Even though somebody could question Google's high quality earnings, their earnings scores are not very good, but it is more US based. It is more consumer based in the US. And so that's very, very important in tech.\nIt seems like we've all been asking the question of what's the next big catalyst to drive conviction within the markets. Does that mean the AI trade or the fast-paced growth cycle for the AI trade is dead?\nNo, I don't think so because let's face it. Probably 10 minutes ago you were looking at AI, or I was looking at AI, or somebody was looking at some agent and the and the new things that are coming out with AI agents and things of this nature are absolutely impactful. The power of AI is growing. It's not shrinking. We're using it more. And it will continue to spread. So I think that trade's not done. I think there'll continue to be infrastructure build outs and AI things, but it has to go past just the technology. You have to look into the in industrial side of tech and where are they putting and building these centers at.\nI want to get to one of your cells, but first really quickly, would you buy Nvidia at these levels?\nUh probably not right now. No. I would be if you're if you're in it, it's time to hold and be patient. But if you're looking to buy, I think there's better opportunities to buy.\nAnd I know one of them is Microsoft, correct?\nI if you're looking at the two comparison, yes, Microsoft today, Nvidia's down more 6-7%, Microsoft's down in one, one and a half right now. I I think that's a safer play. It's a little bit more if if you will ingrained in our society. The revenues are are more um consistent. And so that's something that I would look at is more something like a Google or Microsoft. Both of those I would consider buying opportunities, especially at these levels.\nAnd I know a sell for you is one member of the mag 7. Talk to us about Tesla.\nWell, I think Tesla's had some negative earnings. We know that and um it's under pressure. I think every Tesla's uh I I saw a sticker on the back of a Tesla the other day that said something like, I bought this post crazy. So this is this is very, very important right now in our society. But having said that, I think Elon Musk is going to tell you when it's the right time to buy Tesla. And he hasn't done that yet. So he he's outspoken. We know what he's capable of. And until he's ready to let us know it's the right time to buy, I think it's you avoid that stock right now.\nOutside of tech, where's your favorite trade, your top idea right now?\nAnd I think I think outside of tech, you're going to have to look at some of the healthcare companies that have really been hurt with the Pharmatech news and other things.\nIt seems like they're next though in the docket for what potential tariffs may look like.\nOh, absolutely. So look for those healthcare companies that are not necessarily tied to pharma and they get their revenue, surgical centers and other places that are hospital-based, that are US-based, that we are going to use on a daily basis, but really are not tied to that. Those are the ones that have been kind of the baby been thrown out with the bath water. Their their valuations are very good right now.\nAbsolutely. David, great to see you here in studio. Thanks for taking the time with us this morning.\nThank you.\nAbsolutely.\nThe stock market took a downward turn on Wednesday after Nvidia said it would take a $5.5 billion charge due to U.S. export restrictions on H20 processors to China and other countries.\nChinese online marketplace Temu and fast-fashion retailer Shein, two of the biggest advertisers on U.S. social media, are sharply cutting their U.S. digital ad spending, industry data show, in a blow to tech companies such as Meta's Facebook and YouTube.

While it wasn't an easy time to buy stocks given the uncertainty ahead, doing so could have resulted in some significant gains for investors.\nThe stock market has been in turmoil so far this year amid the tariff-related issues that threaten to send the U.S. economy into a potential recession, and a big drop in consumer sentiment this month has added to the overall negativity.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other machine-learning stocks.\nGrand View Research reported that the global machine-learning market was valued at $36.73 billion in 2022. It‚Äôs now expected to grow at a 34.8% CAGR from 2023 to 2030. Machine learning helps machines and systems learn from experience instead of through explicit programming. It uses algorithms to improve and analyze vast amounts of complex data to make informed decisions. Machine learning is quickly progressing as AI is rapidly expanding and transforming how businesses and individuals operate. These technological advancements are revolutionizing consumer experiences, and enabling convenient creation of digital services, products, and optimized supply chains. With this, startups can focus on specific solutions while larger companies can deliver comprehensive AI platforms.\nOn April 10, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy joined CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄòSquawk Box‚Äô to discuss the cost of AI and what has to happen to bring it down. Jassy emphasized that the growth in data center demand is now so significant that there is no foreseen attenuation here, even with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties under tariffs. While there‚Äôs a general belief that the emergence of DeepSeek could now reduce the need for extensive data centers, processing power, and energy consumption previously forecasted at different tech companies, Jassy thinks that DeepSeek‚Äôs introduction did not disrupt any of this. Despite cost reductions that occurred have already over time, AI deployment still requires significant investment. He thinks that the current AI operations are expensive due to chip costs and other factors, but big techs, including his own company, would welcome any reductions in AI costs for customers moving forward.\nJassy underscored the demand for data centers despite tariff impacts and reflected optimism regarding lowering costs, which would potentially drive innovation and expanded use of AI across industries. AI is still limited and requires substantial human oversight as of now but it has massive potential across various sectors.\nWe sifted through ETFs and financial media reports to compile a list of the top ML stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey‚Äôs database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 234\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a tech company that is currently leading in AI research and uses machine learning across its search engine, cloud services, and other offerings. It operates through three segments under the name of Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments. The Google Cloud segment offers AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, cybersecurity, data and analytics, and other related services.\nRoth MKM recently reiterated a Buy rating on the company with a $220 price target on March 19. This sentiment was fueled by the company‚Äôs $32 billion Wiz acquisition. This is the largest acquisition in the company‚Äôs history. With this, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) can offer improved cloud security and threat detection data across cloud environments. The company is also positioned for long-term AI growth due to its significant infrastructure. This includes data centers, GPUs, and TPUs.\nThe company‚Äôs advanced AI-powered features like AI Overviews in Search are monetized at the same rate as traditional search. For AI and cloud growth, the company is planning a $75 billion CapEx investment in 2025. This will particularly be focused on data centers and servers. Notably, the company‚Äôs Cloud business alone grew by 30% year-over-year in Q4 2024. The combined annual revenue from Cloud and Youtube exceeded $110 billion.\nOakmark Equity and Income Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q4 2024¬†investor letter:\n‚ÄúAlphabet Inc.¬†(NASDAQ:GOOGL) was the top contributor during the quarter. Despite ongoing litigation with the Department of Justice in its antitrust case, the U.S.-headquartered interactive media and services company‚Äôs stock price rose after posting solid third-quarter earnings. In the Search division, the company generated low-teens year-over-year revenue growth and management highlighted that they‚Äôre seeing strong user engagement with their new AI Overviews feature. The biggest upside surprise came from the Cloud division, where revenue growth accelerated to 35% and margins reached a record of 17%. This performance was driven by client demand for AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions as well as core Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products. We continue to believe Alphabet is a collection of great businesses that can unlock further value over the long term through its world-class AI capabilities.‚Äù\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the best machine learning stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of GOOGL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

So after the chip maker disclosed that it would take a $5.5 billion dollar hit from the US government's surprise new controls on its semiconductor exports to China. For more on the latest, let's welcome now Daniel Newman, Futurum CEO. Daniel, it is great to see you here on set. Appreciate it from Texas. Um, you know, before J. Powell, frankly, this was the story of the day. It was chips, it was Nvidia. Nvidia is down here, Dan. It's not about 10%. It's getting clobbered in today's trade. I guess two, two questions to start. One, Dan, were you surprised by that news when you saw those headlines? And two, do you think down 10%, is that move justified in your opinion?\nYeah, first of all, nobody should have been surprised by this move. Really the administration's been giving the signal that it was going to clamp down. Now, what was interesting is this week, there was a bit of gyration because they cut this deal, they announced 500 billion dollars of AI supercomputers being built here in the United States. And then a day later, he pulls back on this new export licensing requirement.\nThat that, you bring that, Dan. That is an interesting point because there were some folks who thought Jensen Wong was going to be kind of shielded from this. Right?\nThey made a deal. I had a few reporters actually hit me up, do you think there was some tip for tat going on. And first of all, I think Trump needs to show, President Trump needs to show that there is no tip for tat. So whether it's, you know, Tim Cook bringing more manufacturing here, whether it's TSMC coming here. But I actually think on the other side of this, and maybe we come back to this, is that I actually think creating some certainty with the, with the community, the business community, about what type of benefit they can expect by onshoring and bringing manufacturing back here. I think that would be a great start. Having said that, national security, economic security, and AI are tightly correlated. Us giving the chips to China, whether it's the tuned down chips or the best chips coming through intermediaries, which they shouldn't be getting. This is something that's giving an advantaging China. There's a lot of people out there that are like, oh, well, this is going to only push their resolve. Do you think China is waiting because we're sending Nvidia chips, they're not investing in Huawei and building their own chips? You can be absolutely certain that they are. This war, this trade war, is largely being fought on the grounds of long-term economic domination. Long-term economic domination will only be had if we control the technology trade. Nvidia is at the forefront of that trade.\nAnd what do you think of from an investor standpoint? Here you have Nvidia falling yet again, 8 to 10%. You know, look what happened over the last couple days. It had recovered from its lows, right? And a lot of investors who got in short term experienced that bounce. Where, where do you think that looks like this week?\nYeah. I, I look at that line of people around the corner at $150 that just couldn't wait to buy. And you go, what is really changed? Well, first of all, you've got GPUs melting over at, at X and at OpenAI. There's so much demand there. Could Nvidia pivot some of its capacity, not focus so much on building specialized products for China, and make sure we meet all the capacity and demand that's out there for companies that are in the US that are trying to build? You've got $325 billion of CAPEX. And it's been reiterated. So whether it's been Sunder Pichai, whether it's been Satya Nadella, they're all planning to spend. And I genuinely believe, Sylvia, that the companies with, you know, the big operating leverage are going to look at this pullback as the moment to build AI infrastructure out. Because when we come out of this, and we will come out of this, there will be deals made. Calling that on the record right now. It may be a tough couple of months. When deals are made, we will see the economy accelerate. And those companies want to build the future and have that AI infrastructure in place. So the Googles and the Microsofts and the Amazons, they're going to buy Nvidia. Um, and one other thing, if I, if I may, I find it very interesting that everybody thinks that China and their push to build Huawei is going to be so successful. When AMD came out with a competitive product, no one believed they could build the software. Broadcom's making chips for the hyperscalers and everyone said, well, that's great, but they don't have CUDA. So it's not going to work as well. But suddenly, everybody believes that China and Huawei is going to build the CUDA competitive product that's going to undo Nvidia? I believe in China, I believe in their resolve. I don't believe that they have as much competition or much competitive capability today as people are suggesting.\nUNI Europa argues that American digital giants like Amazon benefit from unfair economic advantages in the world‚Äôs largest single market and should be dealt with accordingly.\nSNOW and MDB are well-known players in the database management system space. Which one is a better investment option?\nNvidia discloses that sales of its H20 chips to China would require a license ‚Äòfor the indefinite future‚Äô from the U.S. Department of Commerce, AMD says a license requirement for chip exports will result in charges of up to $800 million, and ASML issues disappointing sales guidance.\nU.S. markets fell sharply Wednesday, with chip stocks leading the retreat as U.S.-China trade tensions spooked investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 3.1%, the S&P 500 lost 2.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 700 points, or 1.7%. Losses rippled across sectors, dragging the Russell 2000 down 1.4%.\nDavid Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, discusses expectations for US economic growth, the lack of liquidity in markets, and the outlook for earnings growth. He speaks on \"Bloomberg Open Interest.\"\nWorld stocks fell into a downward spiral on Wednesday led by tech losses after Washington said it is putting new curbs on AI chip exports to China, marking an escalation in the global trade war.  The Trump administration's latest broadside sparked huge demand for safe-haven assets like gold, the Swiss franc and U.S. Treasuries, even though Fed Chair Jerome Powell signalled he is in no rush to cut interest rates.  If U.S. Big Tech had acquired a safe-haven status in the eyes of some investors in recent years, it is disappearing fast.\nThe March retail sales report comes as investors are closely watching for any signs of slowing in US economic growth before the implementation of President Trump's tariffs.\nNextEra (NEE) has an impressive earnings surprise history and currently possesses the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely beat in its next quarterly report.\nTrump wants to bring tech manufacturing to the US.

The messages, often between Zuckerberg and other top Meta executives, painted a picture of an executive who was paranoid about his rivals and willing to buy competitors whenever possible.\nThe FTC is seeking to force Meta to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that the two acquisitions have given Meta an illegal monopoly over parts of the social networking industry. Emails and documents presented at trial show that Meta, then called Facebook Inc., struggled to compete in the mobile app boom in the early 2010s, buying up successful competitors. The FTC said Meta bought the companies to eliminate direct competitive threats.\nMultiple Competitors\nZuckerberg and Meta‚Äôs lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Meta faces a wide array of competitors that fight for user attention, including ByteDance Ltd.‚Äôs TikTok, Google‚Äôs YouTube, Apple Inc.‚Äôs iMessage and Microsoft Corp.‚Äôs LinkedIn. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that TikTok, in particular, posed a ‚Äúhighly urgent‚Äù competitive threat when it sprang up in 2018.\n‚ÄúWe observed that our growth slowed down dramatically,‚Äù as TikTok gained popularity, Zuckerberg said Wednesday. ‚ÄúIt was highly urgent, this has been a top priority for the company for several years.‚Äù Meta eventually rolled out a direct competitor, called Reels, that now drives a significant amount of video traffic for the company.\nZuckerberg was at times vague over his three days in court, and regularly disputed the FTC‚Äôs interpretations of his prior emails. As a leader, the way he communicated with staff was often blunt or harsh, and he spent time on the stand trying to add more nuance to what was written by his younger self. He occasionally clashed with the FTC‚Äôs lead lawyer, Daniel Matheson, who objected at one point that Zuckerberg wasn‚Äôt answering his questions.\nWhat‚Äôs unclear is how much weight those emails will ultimately have as US District Judge James Boasberg, who is presiding over the case, makes his decision. Meta has argued that the intent behind the purchases doesn‚Äôt matter, only whether those deals lead to consumer harm, which it disputes.\nBoasberg previously said the FTC will have a difficult time. Despite allowing the bulk of the case to proceed last November, Boasberg struck a skeptical tone about the FTC‚Äôs chances at trial. ‚ÄúPrevailing here, however, does not obscure the fact that the Commission faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial,‚Äù the judge said. ‚ÄúIndeed, its positions at times strain this country‚Äôs creaking antitrust precedents to their limits.‚Äù\nBoasberg also said in a ruling shortly before the trial that the FTC must prove Meta is harming competition in the present day.\nSheryl Sandberg, the company‚Äôs former chief operating officer, followed Zuckerberg on the witness stand, facing sharp questioning from FTC lawyer Susan Musser.\nIf the FTC prevails, a spinoff of Instagram and WhatsApp would undo years of integration between the apps, disrupt two of the most popular digital consumer products in the world and potentially erase hundreds of billions of dollars in Meta‚Äôs market value. It would also raise serious questions about how the government evaluates and approves deals because the government allowed the transactions to go through at the time.\n‚ÄòNetwork Effects‚Äô\nPart of the FTC‚Äôs case involves the technical concept of ‚Äúnetwork effects,‚Äù meaning that the more users a company like Meta has, the more likely they are to retain a dominant position, because people are unlikely to switch to a service used by few people.\nBoasberg has remained largely silent during the questioning, but interjected during Zuckerberg‚Äôs testimony Wednesday to ask if network effects still really matter.\n‚ÄúHow much does it matter if your friends are on a particular platform if you can send content out of that platform? Why does it matter if your friends are there?‚Äù the judge said.\nZuckerberg said it doesn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúThese apps now serve primarily as discovery engines,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPeople can take that content to messaging engines.‚Äù\nBigger Company\nUnder questioning by Meta lawyer, Mark Hansen, Zuckerberg refuted the FTC‚Äôs argument that Meta bought Instagram to bury a competitor. Instagram would not likely have been able to grow to the extent it has had it remained independent, he said. ‚ÄúInstagram has been built out into a much more vibrant service‚Äù as a result of the deal, Zuckerberg said.\nTaking a small online platform to a billion users and beyond is unlikely to happen without the backing of a larger company, he said. ‚ÄúEvery company that has this level of scale is owned by a bigger company,‚Äù he said, citing TikTok and YouTube as examples.\nEarlier in the trial, it was revealed that Snap Inc.‚Äôs Evan Spiegel turned down a $6 billion acquisition offer from Facebook in 2013 for its Snapchat app. Zuckerberg said that the app would have grown more rapidly had it joined his company.\nZuckerberg sought to walk back some statements that he made in previous internal communications. He acknowledged that he sent a 2013 email saying that Facebook blocked advertising for messaging apps WeChat, Kakao and Line, in which he wrote the apps were ‚Äútrying to build social networks to replace us.‚Äù On the stand this week, however, he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard for me to characterize what their intent was.‚Äù\nMatheson also sought to show that Meta was aware of its antitrust risk years ago, including a possible breakup.\nHe displayed an email from 2018 in which Zuckerberg suggested that Meta should consider spinning off Instagram into a standalone company. ‚ÄúAs calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway,‚Äù he wrote.\nAt one point, Zuckerberg was asked by Hansen to describe how he was evaluating the competitive threat posed by Instagram and others at the time of the deals. He referenced a quote from former Intel Corp. CEO Andy Grove: ‚ÄúOnly the paranoid survive.‚Äù\n(Updates with color on Zuckerberg testimony starting in the first paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM‚Äôs Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump‚Äôs America\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump‚Äôs Tariff Obsession\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\n¬©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\nTrump's trade war is causing all sorts of extreme dislocations in market and economic sentiment.\n(Bloomberg) -- Shale fracker Liberty Energy Inc. posted its worst earnings in three years amid plunging oil prices and mounting concerns about energy demand.Most Read from BloombergTrump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office SpaceHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?Why the Best Bike Lanes Always Get BlamedDOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on LeaveLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal CostsAdjusted first-quarter profit fell to 4 cen\nEven in the midst of a sharp drop in his company‚Äôs stock price and a freight market that is not supporting the bottom line at Triumph Financial, CEO Aaron Graft touted milestones reached and signaled a new aggressiveness in pricing the company‚Äôs products.
