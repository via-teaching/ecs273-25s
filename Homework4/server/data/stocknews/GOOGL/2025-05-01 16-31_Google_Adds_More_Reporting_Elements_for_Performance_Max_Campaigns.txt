Google has announced some new updates for its AI-powered Performance Max campaigns, including channel-level reporting, improved error reporting, and new Search insights to help guide your focus.
Google’s Performance Max ads are designed to drive conversion, with Google’s automated system working to optimize ad performance in real-time, and across channels, using Smart Bidding. The process essentially enables Google’s automated bidding, budget optimization, audiences and creative elements to work together, in order to optimize for the best results in your campaigns, reducing manual workload in focusing your ad performance.
And now, you’ll have more transparency into Performance Max results, so you can track and refine your process.
First off, Google’s adding channel-level performance insights, with a new, simplified presentation to show where you’re seeing better performance.
As explained by Google:
“Channel performance reporting helps you understand how your Performance Max campaign is delivering results across Google’s full range of channels and inventory. On the new ‘Channel performance’ page, you’ll find a campaign-level performance summary along with a new data visualization that makes it easier to dive into which channels you’re engaging customers on and how they’re contributing to your conversion goals.”
So now, you’ll be able to more easily glean insight into where your promotions are getting the most attention, so you can hone in on the channels most likely to drive response.
Google’s also added new diagnostic reporting, which will highlight potential campaign issues:
“You’ll find diagnostics that surface potential issues on specific channels so you know where to prioritize your efforts.”
It’s also adding “Search terms reporting,” which will provide more in-depth insight into how Search is impacting your campaign performance.
“Use this information to create new text assets geared towards your highest-performing search terms. Or if you discover any search terms that aren’t a good fit for your business, apply campaign-level negative keywords or brand exclusions as needed, while keeping an eye on your performance to make sure you’re not limiting your reach.”
Like all AI-powered tools, Performance Max ads are constantly improving, as Google refines its models to ensure the right signals are being used to optimize ad display. 
And given the systematic nature of ad networks, AI systems, which essentially detect and align with usage patterns, can be very good at optimizing ad performance, by ensuring exposure to just the right audiences.
