Adjusted first-quarter profit fell to 4 cents a share, according to a statement Wednesday, matching the average estimate among analysts. Sales and capital spending both came in better than expected, prompting the shares to rise 5.9% at 6:34 p.m. in New York.
Current levels of fracking activity suggest US oil output will hold steady, “mitigating the possibility of steep declines experienced by the service industry in past cycles,” the company said. Meanwhile, major shale driller Diamondback Energy Inc. said Wednesday that it’s “actively reviewing its operating plan” for the rest of the year given market volatility, according to a separate statement.
“While the current tumult in commodity prices is not immediately driving changes in North American activity, we expect oil producers are evaluating a range of scenarios in anticipation of oil price pressure,” Diamondback said.
Liberty’s broad footprint across North American shale provides it a unique scope of vision for domestic oil-production trends. The Denver-based oilfield contractor has tumbled roughly 40% this year as US President Donald Trump’s trade war punished crude prices and tarnished the outlook for near-term fossil-fuel demand.
Liberty is the first major US-based oil-service company to post quarterly results, with rival Halliburton Co. set to follow Tuesday morning.

OpenAI says that it deployed a new system to monitor its latest AI reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini, for prompts related to biological and chemical threats. The system aims to prevent the models from offering advice that could instruct someone on carrying out potentially harmful attacks, according to OpenAI's safety report. O3 and o4-mini represent a meaningful capability increase over OpenAI's previous models, the company says, and thus pose new risks in the hands of bad actors. According to Op
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The top U.S. watchdog agency for consumer finance will cut its inspections of financial services companies in half while focusing on threats to military personnel and turning away from areas like student loans, medical debt, digital payments and consumer data, according to a memo sent to staff on Wednesday.  The decision indicates the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau intends to continue supervision and enforcement activities even though President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, whom Trump charged with overseeing government cost-cutting efforts, earlier this year called for the agency's elimination.
Since his inauguration in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has announced - and sometimes reversed - tariffs on a slew of products and countries.  "Approximately 70% of our aluminum produced in Canada is destined for U.S. customers and is now subject to 25% tariff costs ... Currently the net annual result is approximately $100 million negative for our business," CEO William Oplinger said during a post-earnings conference call.  The aluminum producer said the tariffs on Canadian imports had cost the company roughly $20 million in the first quarter, ended March 31.

President Trump said in a Fox Noticias interview on Tuesday that it is possible he could raise enough funds from the tariffs that he is implementing to eliminate the U.S. income tax, citing a time in the late 1800s when the U.S. implemented tariffs and raised such funds.  “There is a chance that the money is so great that it could replace” income tax, Trump said.  Any action on income tax would have to be passed by Congress, which legislates on tax policy.
