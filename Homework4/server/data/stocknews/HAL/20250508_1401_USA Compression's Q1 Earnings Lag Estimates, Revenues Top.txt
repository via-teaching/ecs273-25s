USA Compression PartnersUSAC reported first-quarter adjusted net profit of 18 cents per common unit, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents due to higher total costs and other expenses.

(See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.) The largest independent provider of natural gas compression services generated revenues of $245.2 million, which increased 7% from the year-ago quarter’s level and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $244 million. This growth was due to a 3.2% increase in Contract operations and a huge 165.5% jump in Related party revenues.

Oil and gas equipment and services providerLiberty EnergyLBRT reported a first-quarter 2025 adjusted net income of 4 cents per share, which marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. Liberty's outperformance indicated operational efficiencies as well as increased utilization of frac and wireline fleets.

Meanwhile, Halliburton’s revenues of $5.4 billion decreased 6.7% year over year but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.3 billion. As of March 31, 2025, Halliburton had approximately $1.8 billion in cash/cash equivalents and $7.2 billion in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 40.8.
