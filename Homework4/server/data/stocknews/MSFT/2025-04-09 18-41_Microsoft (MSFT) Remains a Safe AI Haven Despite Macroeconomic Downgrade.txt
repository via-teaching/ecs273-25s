In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)C stands against other AI stocks in focus. President Donald Trump’s new tariff regimes have been introduced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. A 10% tariff was imposed on nearly all countries and territories this Saturday, with rates expected to escalate higher and become even more individualized for the “worst” offenders. In a tit-for-tat blow against Trump and his tariffs, China has moved to impose a 34% tax on all US goods. Investment firm Wedbush has recently criticized these tariffs, citing them as a potential “economic Armageddon” for the U.S. tech sector. Analysts headed by Dan Ives believe that the impact of these tariffs could be even worse than previous major market crashes, such as the dot-com bubble and the 2008 financial crisis. This could wipe out a decade of technological progress in the US.

Since China is its largest market in 2024, it will be impacted by the tariffs. Other companies being hit by the tariffs include Micron, considering some of its chips sold in China are imported from the US. This is despite the country having production facilities in China and other countries. All in all, the firm is persistent that continued tariffs would imply lower growth, lower revenues, and lower profits for companies. “The higher than expected tariff rates … were not factored into many investors’ or companies’ calculations. The question is will there be enough time for them to actually get those numbers in in time? Because we don’t know what the retaliation measures are going to be from some of the European partners … or even from other countries, in that sort of scenario exact numbers might be lacking in some cases”.
