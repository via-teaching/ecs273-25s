              A threat actor tracked as Storm-2460 has used PipeMagic malware to facilitate the attacks. PipeMagic, which functions both as a backdoor and a gateway, was discovered in 2022 by Kaspersky researchers. The malware at that time was used in attacks in Asia and was later found in backdoor attacks in Saudi Arabia, using a fake ChatGPT application as a lure.  Researchers at ESET also observed in PipeMagic in connection with a zero-day exploit of a Win32 vulnerability, which is tracked as CVE-2025-24983.  “Our vulnerability report, including PipeMagic samples, possibly led Microsoft to do further investigation on their own and resulted in their recent discovery of CVE-2025-29824,” Filip Jurcacko, senior malware researcher at ESET, said via email.  Beyond the attacks on IT and real estate companies in the U.S., the financial sector in Venezuela, the retail sector in Saudi Arabia and a Spanish software firm were all targeted, according to Microsoft researchers.  Microsoft said it has not determined the initial access vectors for the current attacks but has observed the threat actor downloading the certutil from a legitimate third-party website that was previously compromised to host the malware.  The exploit targets a vulnerability in the CLFS kernel driver, according to Microsoft researchers. Customers running Windows 11 version 24H2 were not affected by the observed threat activity, even in cases where the vulnerability exists, according to Microsoft. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has added CVE-2025-29824 to its known exploited vulnerabilities catalog.  Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Photo illustration: Industry Dive; US Securities and Exchange Commission The words businesses use in cybersecurity disclosures matter.
