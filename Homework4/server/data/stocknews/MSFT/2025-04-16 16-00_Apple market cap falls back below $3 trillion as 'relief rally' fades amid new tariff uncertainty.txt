Apple (AAPL) stock fell nearly 4% on Wednesday, sending the iPhone maker's market capitalization back below $3 trillion as tariff pressures continue to weigh on the company after shares had enjoyed what some analysts called a "relief rally" earlier in the week. Apple stock surged to start the week, leading the "Magnificent Seven" stocks higher as investors cheered the Trump administration's temporary tariff exemptions for tech products announced over the weekend. The "relief rally," as Citi's Atif Malik put it, briefly put Apple's value back above the $3 trillion mark after falling to its lowest value in almost a year last week at just under $2.6 trillion. Apple is still the world's most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft (MSFT). US Customs and Border Protection issued regulations late Friday exempting consumer electronics — and almost all of Apple's products — from reciprocal tariffs. On April 2, Trump announced global reciprocal tariffs that would go into effect on April 9.

Some 90% of Apple's iPhones are made in China. Apple had shed more than $770 billion from its market cap between April 2 and April 8. Apple's decline on Wednesday comes after Nvidia (NVDA) disclosed late Tuesday that the Trump administration had effectively banned exports of its H20 chips to China. Nvidia's disclosure followed reports that Trump had been set to back off plans to restrict Nvidia's chips designed for China to comply with US trade rules. To Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, these developments show that there are “many conflicting opinions within Trump's team on the issue of tariffs, strategies against China and US tech restrictions." "The concern about Apple is that it will become harder to avoid the crossfire between the US and China as tariffs and restrictions come into play," DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an email. "The [export] restrictions on chips that came out from NVIDIA represent an escalation in the trade dispute." Tech stocks fell across the board Wednesday, with the Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropping 3%. Fellow Magnificent Seven stocks Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) also sank, falling nearly 4%, while Nvidia plummeted almost 7%. Trump also set the stage to tariff semiconductors this week — the Commerce Department opened a probe into computer chips Tuesday under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which grants the president the ability to impose levies on imports due to national security. And Trump has promised that most electronics will still get wrapped up in his tariffs, which could hurt Apple. "We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations," he posted Sunday.

Here's what Lawrence McDonald of the Bear Traps Report has to say. The news comes a day after Nvidia warned of a $5.5 billion hit as Washington restricted exports of its AI processor tailored for China.  Intel, under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, told clients last week that its chips would require a license for exporting to China if they have a total DRam bandwidth of 1,400 gigabytes (GB) per second or more, input-output (I/O) bandwidth of 1,100 GB per second or more, or a total of both of 1,700 GB per second or more, according to the report.  Intel's Gaudi series as well as Nvidia's H20 far exceed these requirements, the report said. President Trump’s 25% tariffs on the auto sector are the talk of the New York International Auto Show. Egypt's revenue from the Suez Canal plunged by almost two thirds last year, officials said Wednesday, attributing the sharp drop to regional tensions and wars in the Middle East that have impacted traffic through the key waterway.  The canal is a major source of foreign currency for the Egyptian government, with about 10% of world trade flowing through the waterway in recent years.  The Suez Canal Authority, which runs the waterway, said the canal generated an annual revenue of $3.991 billion in 2024, down from a historic high of $10.25 billion in 2023, according to a statement posted on its Facebook page.
