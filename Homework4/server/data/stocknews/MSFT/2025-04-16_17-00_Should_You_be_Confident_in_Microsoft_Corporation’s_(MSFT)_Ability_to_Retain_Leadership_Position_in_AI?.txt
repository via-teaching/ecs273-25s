The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office365, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares detracted from performance as Azure revenue growth missed analyst estimates, marking the third consecutive quarter of modest disappointment in this segment. However, AI-related sales growth exceeded expectations, accounting for 13% of Azure’s quarterly growth. Management also maintained their fiscal third quarter earnings guidance while highlighting improved operating profitability and lower tax rates. Despite the disappointing quarter, we remain confident in Microsoft’s ability to sustain its leadership position in AI."</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">A development team working together to create the next version of Windows.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is in second position our list of <a class="link" data-rapid_p="15" data-ylk="slk:30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/30-most-popular-stocks-among-hedge-funds-2024-q3-1415561/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds</a>.
