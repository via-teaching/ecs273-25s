However, the trends in March are not so different from what's happening now, as consumer sentiment was rapidly weakening and fears of a recession were mounting before the <a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/t/tariffs/">tariff</a> announcement.</p>, <p>Let's take a look at the two best-performing <strong>Dow Jones Industrial Average </strong><span class="font-bold whitespace-nowrap" data-id="220471">(<a class="ticker-symbol" href="/quote/djindices/%5Edji/">^DJI</a><span class="text-red-900 ticker-change"> -1.73%</span>)</span> companies to see if they're worth buying today.</p>, <p class="caption">Image source: Getty Images.</p>, <p><strong>UnitedHealth Group</strong> <span class="font-bold whitespace-nowrap" data-id="205890">(<a class="ticker-symbol" href="/quote/nyse/unh/">UNH</a><span class="text-green-900 ticker-change"> 0.30%</span>)</span> is one of the most resilient stocks on the market. Healthcare is considered a recession-proof industry, but health insurance is even more unaffected by the economy because people need coverage regardless.</p>, <p>It's not a surprise, then, that investors have piled into the stock in March and have continued to do so through the tariff-related chaos of April.</p>, <p>There was no major company-specific news out on UnitedHealth in March, and investors seem to be returning to the stock after it tumbled following the assassination of one of its executives in December 2024.</p>, <p>UnitedHealth has been one of the rare winners on the stock market in April, gaining 15% thanks to a 5.06% increase in Medicare Advantage benchmarks and its reputation as a port in a storm during turbulent market times.</p>, <p><strong>Chevron </strong><span class="font-bold whitespace-nowrap" data-id="203255">(<a class="ticker-symbol" href="/quote/nyse/cvx/">CVX</a><span class="text-green-900 ticker-change"> 0.65%</span>)</span> might seem like a surprise on this list as the energy sector is typically highly sensitive to the economic cycle.</p>, <p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
