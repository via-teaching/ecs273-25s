Cramer noted that information is being released constantly, through press conferences, posts on Truth Social, or casual remarks, and that each has the potential to move vast sums of money across asset classes.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">“Trillions of dollars in and out of bonds, of currency, of gold, of crypto,” he said, all based on impulsive statements. He pointed out the sheer volume of contradictions in the news cycle and stressed, “Except this isn’t an eight-part blockbuster, it’s our money.” Cramer lamented how even social media activity, like tweets, can trigger massive swings in the markets. He noted that Friday’s market action felt like it was shaped entirely by this dynamic.</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">Cramer questioned whether the market might be in the process of forming what he called a “liberation day bottom,” a moment when selling pressure finally ends because investors feel that all the bad news is out. But he acknowledged the uncertainty of that theory as he said, “Not sure, I’m just not sure.” He added:</p>, <p class="yf-1ba2ufg">“Have you ever noticed the weekends don’t provide relaxation anymore because the president’s got advisors? He’s got to put people out. He wants to tweet. He’s got meetings. No relaxation time, no downtime…. Monday’s trading, well, let’s just say that it looks like that it’s earning season so it’s gonna be even harder than usual.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">For this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 11. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

I think this company’s the only gimme that I’ve seen this week. This is as close to one as you’re gonna find, not too high a price-to-earnings multiple, not yet overly loved, purely domestic business, has pricing power. This is it. It’s a universal buy.”</p>, <p class="yf-1090901">UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is a healthcare organization that offers health plans, care services, pharmacy support, and wellness programs. It also delivers software, consulting, and data tools to companies in the healthcare sector.

While we acknowledge the potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.
