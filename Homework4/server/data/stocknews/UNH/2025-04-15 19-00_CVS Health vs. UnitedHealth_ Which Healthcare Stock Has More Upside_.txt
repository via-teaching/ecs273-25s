Content: Currently,CVS HealthCVS andUnitedHealth GroupUNH are two major vertically integrated behemoths in the U.S. healthcare market and key constituents of the S&P 500 index. Both companies have transformed beyond their original identities — CVS Health from a retail pharmacy chain into a healthcare powerhouse through its acquisition of Aetna and UnitedHealth from a traditional insurer into a tech-enabled care provider via its expansive Optum platform. Each now combines insurance, care delivery, pharmacy benefit management (PBM) and value-based service models to offer end-to-end healthcare solutions. For investors, it is difficult to choose between the two, as both CVS and UnitedHealth continue to diversify their revenue streams and scale up their clinical and digital infrastructure. While they share structural similarities in business segmentation — insurance, health services, and pharmacy operations — their financial trajectories, operating margins, capital deployment strategies and risk exposures differ notably. Let’s examine which is the stronger buy right now. After a rough 2024, marked by high utilization at its Aetna insurance unit as well as reimbursement pressure, CVS Health has experienced a dramatic recovery so far in 2025. The stock has become the S&P 500’s top performer, with a year-to-date return of 56%, thereby outperforming all other index members by a significant margin. UnitedHealth, on the other hand, is at number 16 on the chart with a 16.5% gain. The stocks, however, outperformed the benchmark’s 8% dip during this period.

Favorable reserve developments and less severe-than-expected medical trends supported the performance. For 2025, CVS Health projects $132 billion in healthcare benefits revenues and at least $1.5 billion in adjusted operating income, with a 100-basis-point Medical Benefit Ratio improvement to 91.5%. While Medicare Advantage and individual exchange membership may decline, these are expected to be offset by growth in commercial self-insured plans and stronger plan design. The company is also executing a $2 billion multi-year cost efficiency initiative with 2025 savings expected to fully absorb rising variable expenses.
