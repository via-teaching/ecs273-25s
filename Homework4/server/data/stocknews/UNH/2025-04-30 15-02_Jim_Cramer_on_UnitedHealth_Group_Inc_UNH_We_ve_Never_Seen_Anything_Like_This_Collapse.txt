We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Talks About Elon Musk & Discusses These 11 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently discussed.
In a recent appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented that he believed that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, would target wasteful government spending. Musk, during the latest earnings call of his car company, shared that he would soon step back from DOGE and return to managing his businesses. The news sent the shares of his firm soaring by 10% since the report, and media reports since then have also pointed towards disagreements between him and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.
Cramer commented:
“I’m beginning to think that, I thought Medicaid would be immune, look, do I want it to be immune? I don’t want anything to be immune. I kept hoping that DOGE would go after where the real money is, uh, Medicaid, that could hurt a bunch of companies. Medicaid, David, is bedrock.”
He also mentioned that businesses continued to face uncertainty when it came to the impact of tariffs. Recalling a recent conversation, Cramer outlined: “I was talking to someone today, he said look, we do business in China. How do you think we’ll do with the tariff, the 200% tariffs? I said no, that’s an embargo, that’s not a tariff. You don’t understand. . .that’s not meant to be used.”
The CNBC host also highlighted that perhaps markets opened in the green that day because “the President said nothing nasty. He’s not been vicious. He’s not called names.”
Cramer also commented on Vice President Vance’s visit to India and wondered whether the US could increase its coal exports to the country as part of the President’s bid to reduce the trade deficit. “I know India needs coal. We got coal,” said Cramer. “We are the Saudi Arabia of coal. And not anthracite cause that’s a little too dirty,” he added.
One sector that entered 2025 with high hopes but has faltered since then is data center. Data centers form the backbone of AI computing, and the stocks have struggled ever since the DeepSeek selloff in January. According to Cramer:
“Oh my god the data center, oh, remember when the data center was this growth industry where everything . . .woah, Amazon Web Services, actually not really. Microsoft, not really. But it doesn’t matter. The data center is now kryptonite, it’s like look out this thing, no, you don’t wanna be in here.”
When asked what would it take for investors to realize that data centers are still a growth industry, here’s what he said:
“You have to see the CapEx numbers and realize the CapEx numbers have not declined. And think that’s what’s gonna happen because I still think that there’s a tremendous, tremendous opportunity to be the number one search.”

UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) is a mega American healthcare benefits manager whose shares have been the talk of the town lately. The stock dipped by a whopping 22% in April after the firm’s earnings missed analyst estimates for the first time since 2008. To make matters worse, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) also cut its full-year profit guidance and the new metric also missed analyst estimates. Here’s what Cramer said:
“By the way, they’re still downgrading UNH. They’re still downgrading UNH. . .you know it was a 12% cut. And, everybody says the same thing. We’ve never seen anything like this from UNH. Because UNH’s so perfect, I mean it’s a Dow stock, it’s actually up today. That’s interesting.”
