We recently published a list ofJim Cramer Questions Market Logic and Dissects These 7 Key Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.
In his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer unpacked the deepening uncertainty gripping both markets and politics as investors brace for higher inflation, elevated yields, and an unpredictable White House. With bond yields climbing and tariffs expanding across sectors, Cramer highlighted just how fragile investor conviction has become:
[talking about rising bond yields on 10Y treasuries] “You have a lot of people who say, you know what, I’ve got to revisit everything because of the inflationary nature. Maybe I have to buy them at 5-6%. Now, the reason I say that is because I think when the average person looks at the huge inflation that’s coming, they can’t think of a reason to buy bonds. And that’s where I’m stuck. Why would I buy that piece of paper? I mean, if the Japanese are selling that piece of paper and the Chinese are selling that piece of paper, why am I buying that piece of paper? And the answer is, I’m not. Let’s wait. A lot of things are ‘let’s wait’ in the bond market. In the stock market, there’s people taking action every minute on craziness.”

He also emphasized the sheer weight of presidential authority in shaping market sentiment, warning that Main Street rhetoric alone won’t shield investors from the fallout:
“The president is very powerful right now. Immensely powerful. More powerful than ever in my life. It would be amazing if the president said, you know what, we’re done for now. We’re done. But he came out and said, now it’s pharma’s turn. So as long as this keeps up, and he said he doesn’t care about Wall Street, he cares about Main Street. At a certain point, if you care about Main Street, then you do actually care about the 401k.”

Looking for safety at a time of geopolitical and macro uncertainty, Jim Cramer highlighted UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) as a prime example of a domestic, tariff-insulated stock likely to outperform in this environment. He explained:
“Right now, there’ll be a lot of fund managers who say, why do I need any of this? Just give me stocks that are American stocks that have nothing to do. And UnitedHealth, which sells at 19 times earnings, would probably sell at 25 times earnings in the near-term future, because UnitedHealth actually defines what I’m telling you people want. Up another 12 today. And that’s how money managers work. They’ll buy Humana, they’ll buy UNH, they’ll buy Cigna. […]
