            </p>, <p class="form-error__message" id="interstitial-error"></p>, <p>This summer, UnitedHealth, Amedisys and antitrust regulators will have a magistrate judge’s help in hashing out a solution to the DOJ’s opposition to the merger.</p>, <p>UnitedHealth’s health services division <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/unitedhealth-optum-amedisys-acquisition-option-care/653870/">Optum first announced plans to buy Amedisys</a> in summer 2023 after a bidding war over the Louisiana-based home health and hospice provider. Amedisys shareholders approved the deal later that year.</p>, <p>However, the merger has been held up by antitrust regulators, who say UnitedHealth’s ownership of LHC Group, a rival to Amedisys that <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/unitedhealth-lhc-group-closes-buy-home-health/643200/">UnitedHealth acquired for $5.4 billion</a> in 2023, is cause for concern.</p>, <p>If the transaction goes through, Optum will control 30% or more of the home health or hospice markets in eight states, the DOJ said in its complaint. The deal will also add 500 care sites to Optum’s home health and hospice portfolio and extend its reach into five additional states, harming patients and providers by eliminating competition, according to the DOJ.</p>, <p>UnitedHealth and Amedisys, which deny that their merger would have anticompetitive effects, have <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/unitedhealth-amedisys-sell-clinics-advance-deal-vitalcaring/720259/">offered plans to divest businesses</a> to ameliorate the DOJ’s concerns.</p>, <p>Most recently, UnitedHealth and Amedisys offered to sell more than 120 home health and hospice facilities, according <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25898220-093114638735/">to a court filing in February</a>. If the sales are approved, UnitedHealth would only operate 10% of home health and 4% of hospice services in the U.S.</p>, <p>Still, the offers have not proved sufficient for the DOJ, which has grown increasingly concerned about the size and influence of UnitedHealth — a company that operates one of the largest insurers in the nation, a major pharmacy benefit manager and a healthcare technology company, while employing thousands of physicians.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/unitedhealth-antitrust-investigation-doj-unitedhealthcare-optum/708727/">The DOJ is reportedly investigating</a> the conglomerate for its potential anticompetitive effects, including the relationship between Optum and its insurer UnitedHealthcare.
