Content: Last Friday, the three most widely followed benchmark indexes closed a volatile yet winning week. The Nasdaq Composite, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 7.3%, 5.7% and 5%, respectively. Throughout the week, trade was influenced by tariff reprieves announced on European goods and a trade war between the United States and China. The S&P 500 and the Dow registered their biggest weekly percentage gains since November 2023, and the tech-focused Nasdaq claimed its biggest advance since November 2022. For March, inflation numbers both on the consumer and producer side came in negative, against expectations. Consumer sentiments, however, have declined further, and all eyes are currently set on developments from the White House and its multi-front tariff war.
