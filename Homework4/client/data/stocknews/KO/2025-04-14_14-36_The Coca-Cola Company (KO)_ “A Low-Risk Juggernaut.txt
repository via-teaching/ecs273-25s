We recently published a list of10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar.
On Thursday, Mad Money host Jim Cramer cautioned viewers about what may lie ahead once the 90-day pause on new tariffs comes to an end. While discussing the latest Consumer Price Index report, Cramer acknowledged that the numbers looked favorable, with inflation appearing relatively tame and even some categories experiencing actual price declines. He pointed to energy prices, saying, “The best, anything it touched energy, which is plummeting.”

“This is essentially an embargo. President Trump’s ecstatic that the tariffs are already taking in $2 billion a day. He’s thrilled that supposedly 75 countries are begging for something more reasonable than the 90-day pause when the 90-day pause comes to an end.”
According to Cramer, President Trump is “ecstatic” that these tariffs are already generating $2 billion a day in revenue and is thrilled about 75 countries “supposedly” asking for something more workable once the 90-day grace period concludes. Despite the seemingly positive revenue flow, Cramer expressed concern over the broader consequences. He pointed out that many Americans have yet to grasp the full impact of trade policies that have allowed foreign businesses to flood U.S. markets with inexpensive products, often pricing out domestic companies.
While many consumers embraced the lower costs, Cramer reminded his audience that it came at the expense of American jobs. “Now we’re going to have to pay a price. He stressed that consumers should be prepared to pay significantly more for a wide range of goods. He said that the additional cost largely will likely benefit foreign companies, which will hike prices in response to the tariffs imposed on them. He clarified his position by stating he is not a staunch advocate of free trade for its own sake. “No other country plays by the rules on trade, so we shouldn’t either,” he said but cautioned:
“We just have to be more thoughtful about this or we’ll end up doing more harm than good. Again, as someone who wants fair trade, not free trade, I am rooting for the president to pull this off, but not at the expense of great American companies that have done nothing wrong and are the best in the world.”

A caller asked what Cramer thought of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and he replied:
“I love that…. James Quincey is terrific. It’s got a good dividend. It’s really well run. It’s got an international presence… and it’s doing well in this environment. You have a winner.”
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that offers a wide variety of nonalcoholic drinks. Its products include soft drinks, water, tea, juice, plant-based options, concentrates, and syrups for retail use. In February, Cramer said:
“… Sometimes companies can practically print money simply because they’re so well run. Take Coca-Cola. Under the steady hand of James Quincey, Coca-Cola has become a low-risk juggernaut with a solid dividend, definitely a stock that is worth owning.”
