Spot gold climbed 1.7% to $3,283.63 per ounce, while June gold futures peaked at $3,299.52 per ounce. The rally was supported by a weakening U.S. dollar and selling pressure on U.S. Treasuries, reflecting growing concerns about the U.S. economic outlook under President Donald Trump.
Trump announced a 145% cumulative tariff on Chinese imports earlier this week, with additional levies under consideration for electronics and pharmaceuticals. China responded with a 125% tariff on U.S. goods. While the U.S. president exempted electronics from the latest measures and granted a 90-day reprieve on reciprocal tariffs for select countries, the shifting policy stance left markets unsettled.
Nvidia warned Tuesday that the company faces a $5.5 billion charge in the first quarter due to U.S. restrictions on semiconductor exports to China. The company said the move may limit sales opportunities in one of the world's largest chip markets. Nvidia shares fell 8.79% to $102.34 following the disclosure, leading declines in tech-heavy indices and sparking losses among chipmakers in Asia. The curbs could also restrict access to artificial intelligence components for Chinese firms, increasing the risk of further retaliatory trade actions.
Silver futures rose 0.5% to $32.455 per ounce, while platinum futures slipped 0.1% to $968.95 per ounce. Copper prices moved lower despite China's first-quarter gross domestic product exceeding expectations. Analysts cautioned that future GDP readings may reflect the economic toll of escalating trade tensions. Copper on the London Metal Exchange dropped 0.6% to $9,108.85 per ton, while U.S. copper futures slipped 0.5% to $4.5920 per pound.
Major U.S. stock indexes fell, with the Nasdaq Composite down 3.29%, the S&P 500 losing 2.27%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declining 1.54%. The U.S. dollar index dropped 0.71% to 99.25, and the CBOE Volatility Index rose 9.46% to 32.97.
Other major decliners included Tesla (TSLA,Financials), Palantir (PLTR,Financials), and Apple (AAPL,Financials), each posting sharp losses alongside Nvidia.

The stock market took a downward turn on Wednesday after Nvidia said it would take a $5.5 billion charge due to U.S. export restrictions on H20 processors to China and other countries.
The chip maker will take a $5.5 billion charge in the current quarter for H20 inventory and canceled sales.
The U.S.-China tech war just claimed another high-profile casualty.
Nvidia discloses that sales of its H20 chips to China would require a license ‘for the indefinite future’ from the U.S. Department of Commerce, AMD says a license requirement for chip exports will result in charges of up to $800 million, and ASML issues disappointing sales guidance.
TSMC is a crucial player in the artificial-intelligence chip market, which has been upended by tariff turmoil.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC, is the world's largest semiconductor foundry, which fabricates chips for the top consumer electronics companies and chip designers across the globe.  The world's leading companies, such as Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, Sony, and Apple, tap TSMC's plants for manufacturing chips that power personal computers (PCs), smartphones, data centers, and gaming consoles, among others.  As a result, TSMC is in a solid position to benefit from the secular growth of the global semiconductor market, which is expected to hit $2 trillion in annual revenue in 2032.
Nvidia on Tuesday said it would take $5.5 billion in charges after the U.S. government limited exports of its H20 artificial intelligence chip to China, a key market for one of its most popular chips.  Nvidia's AI chips have been a key focus of U.S. export controls as U.S. officials have moved to keep the most advanced chips from being sold to China as the U.S. tries to keep ahead in the AI race.  After those controls were implemented, Nvidia began designing chips that would come as close as possible to U.S. limits.
The S&P 500 lost 2.2% on Wednesday, April 16, as the Federal Reserve chair discussed possible inflationary and economic consequences of tariffs.
BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) -Global shares fell sharply on Wednesday as U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China and continued tariff uncertainty battered tech stocks, while gold traded at record highs and support for the dollar continued to erode.  Washington issued new export licensing requirements for sales to China of Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 artificial intelligence chips.  Nvidia said the move would cost it $5.5 billion and its shares slumped nearly 7%.
