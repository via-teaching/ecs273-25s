What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growingreturnon capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company'samountof capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high forMcDonald's(NYSE:MCD), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.
Trump has pledged to "unleash" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on McDonald's is:
Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)
0.23 = US$12b ÷ (US$55b - US$3.9b)(Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).
Thus,McDonald's has an ROCE of 23%.That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10.0% earned by companies in a similar industry.

In the above chart we have measured McDonald's' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you cancheck out the forecasts from the analysts covering McDonald'sforfree.
Over the past five years, McDonald's' ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. Although current returns are high, we'd need more evidence of underlying growth for it to look like a multi-bagger going forward. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that McDonald's has been paying out a decent 56% of its earnings to shareholders. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.
Although is allocating it's capital efficiently to generate impressive returns, it isn't compounding its base of capital, which is what we'd see from a multi-bagger. Since the stock has gained an impressive 92% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.
McDonald's does have some risks though, and we've spotted2 warning signs for McDonald'sthat you might be interested in.
