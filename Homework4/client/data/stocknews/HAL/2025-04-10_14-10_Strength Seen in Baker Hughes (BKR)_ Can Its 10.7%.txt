Baker Hughes BKR shares soared 10.7% in the last trading session to close at $38.75. The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 16.4% loss over the past four weeks.
Oil prices have bounced back as investors remain hopeful that an energy market downturn is unlikely, thanks to a broader market recovery following President Donald Trump's move to pause "reciprocal" tariff hikes and implement a lower 10% tariff rate for most countries over the next 90 days. This rebound in crude prices is a positive development for oilfield service companies like Baker Hughes, leading to a sharp rise in its stock price.
This oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.6%. Revenues are expected to be $6.51 billion, up 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.
Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.
For Baker Hughes, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on BKR going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.
The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
