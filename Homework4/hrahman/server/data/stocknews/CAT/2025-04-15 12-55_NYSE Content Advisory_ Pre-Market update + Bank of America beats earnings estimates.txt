Johnson & Johnson forecasts about $400 million in costs this year related to tariffs on medical devices, said Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk in an interview.  Wolk said the estimated costs represent a "worst-case scenario" and take into account President Trump‚Äôs 90-day pause, China's retaliatory tariffs and the resumption of the U.S. tariffs.  J&J isn't doing anything differently yet in response to tariffs, Wolk added.

The pullback meant LVMH lost its crown as Europe‚Äôs most valuable luxury company to Herm√®s, which reports later this week.
Bank of America and Citigroup said consumer spending ticked higher in the first quarter, when concerns about the economy began to bubble up.
