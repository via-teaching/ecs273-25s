# How to write a Good README

## Introduction

As we have already been asking you to submit your work along with a `README.md`, until now it is almost the final submission for this course. However, I have noticed that most of you are not familiar with what a README file in your project should include. Thus, I decided to share this guideline to tell you what is README and what a good README should contain.

A README is a text file that introduces and explains a project. It contains information that is commonly required to understand what the project is about, how to set it up and how to use it.

## README Format

`README.md` follows markdown syntax, which you can find the details at [this guidelines on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) or [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/github-flavored-markdown-syntax-examples/).

## Setup Instruction

This part should clearly describe how people can run your project from scratch. You should assume the users as who:

- Knows basics of web development
- Can use the terminal command line
- Do not know the details of your specific project or setup
- Expect the app to run easily if they follow instructions step by step, not guessing any missing steps or configuration
- Asking them open random IDE WITHOUT any setup is totally unapplicable

Thus, you should write your instructions as if someone not familiar with your code at all is reading it.

This part should include installing dependencies, starting services and how to run the code (including backend and frontend).
Please do not state something like "run the code" **without any command line instructions**. 

### A backend instruction example:

**1. Navigate to the backend folder**
```
cd server
```
**2. (Optional but recommended) Set up a Python virtual environment (or conda based on your preference)**
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

**3. Install required Python packages**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Make sure MongoDB is running**
If using Homebrew on macOS:
```
brew services start mongodb-community
```
**5. Import data into the database (if required)**
```
python import_data.py
```
**6. Run the FastAPI server**
```
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```
API Docs available at: http://localhost:8000/docs

### A frontend instruction example
**1. Navigate to the frontend folder**
```
cd client
```
**2. Install required Node.js packages**
```
npm install
```
**3. Start the React development server**
```
npm run dev
```

**4. Visit the frontend in your browser**
Usually: http://localhost:5173
